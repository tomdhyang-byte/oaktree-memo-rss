      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From:    Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Re:  A Look Under the Hood &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over the last 56 years, I’ve spent a lot of time making suggestions to clients regarding their investment &lt;br /&gt;processes and portfolios, and I’ve been on the client side as a member of various investment committees.  &lt;br /&gt;But seldom have I been able to bridge the two, serving as an active participant in clients’ investment &lt;br /&gt;processes.  I had an opportunity to do just that the other day, when I met with the board and senior staff of &lt;br /&gt;a U.S. state pension fund.  I was asked to listen in and provide feedback on the results of a board-member &lt;br /&gt;survey their consultant had recently conducted and would be reporting on during the meeting.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The content of the consultant’s session impressed me so much that I decided to write a memo about it.  &lt;br /&gt;I’m not disclosing the names of the state and its consultant, for obvious reasons, but I’m very pleased that &lt;br /&gt;they agreed to let me use the content of the meeting as raw material for this memo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the meeting, the consultant covered many of the things I consider “the most important thing” and often &lt;br /&gt;came down on the same side I would (admittedly, that might’ve contributed to why I was so impressed!).   &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to sum up below the consultant’s assessment of the board survey and my reaction.  My hope is &lt;br /&gt;that this is as informative for you as it was for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attitudes Toward Risk &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As you can imagine, I was very glad to see the consultant start with a discussion of how the board &lt;br /&gt;members think about risk, and especially do it in a way that was new to me.  They led off with a simple &lt;br /&gt;two-by-two matrix that I found thought-provoking and useful, as it put one of the most important &lt;br /&gt;decisions into perspective. &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the horizontal axis is the plan’s ability to bear risk.  When I first read that, I thought it referred to the &lt;br /&gt;skillfulness of its board and staff in managing risk.  But then it became clear that the reference was to the &lt;br /&gt;plan’s financial capacity to accept risk, defined by its financial health and that of its sponsor, the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;On the vertical axis is the plan’s willingness to bear risk – its attitude toward taking on risk and readiness &lt;br /&gt;to withstand the losses that might result.  In other words, is the board relatively risk-tolerant or risk-&lt;br /&gt;averse?  Will it assume more risk in pursuit of above average returns, or will it shun risk, knowing that &lt;br /&gt;doing so is likely to limit the returns it enjoys?  Importantly, “more risk” and “less risk” are considered &lt;br /&gt;relative to the maximum amount of risk that the plan’s “ability” might allow it to bear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The labeling of the matrix’s four cells is very informative: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• If an investor has a high financial ability to bear risk and a high willingness, it is described as &lt;br /&gt;“capitalizing” on, or taking advantage of, its financial strength and risk-tolerance. &lt;br /&gt;• If it has a high ability to bear risk but a low willingness, it is said to be “defensive.”  It could take &lt;br /&gt;on more risk than it does, but it has chosen to operate at a lower risk level.  &lt;br /&gt;• If it has a low ability to bear risk and a low willingness, it is described as being “protective,” &lt;br /&gt;which seems appropriate given its circumstances.  However, it should be recognized that this is &lt;br /&gt;likely to limit returns in the short run, and thus to create a need to shoulder more risk and/or &lt;br /&gt;increase contributions in the out years. &lt;br /&gt;• Finally, if it has a low ability to bear risk but a high willingness, it is described as “naive.”  I think &lt;br /&gt;that might be a generous description.  What could be more foolish than taking risk that entails &lt;br /&gt;potential consequences you might not be able to survive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The consultant’s survey described the board as having a moderate willingness to accept risk despite the &lt;br /&gt;plan’s above average ability to bear it (stemming from the plan’s solid funding status and the state’s &lt;br /&gt;strong economic performance).  This suggests returns will be constrained, but also that the plan and its &lt;br /&gt;constituencies won’t be exposed to the greater range of outcomes that increased willingness would bring. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I found this an organized way to approach risk bearing, in which the most important thing is that it’s done &lt;br /&gt;explicitly and intelligently.  It reminded me of the conditions that existed when I was asked to chair the &lt;br /&gt;University of Pennsylvania’s investment committee in mid-2000.  Penn’s endowment performance had &lt;br /&gt;lagged that of its peers because of its having been severely underweighted in growth, tech, venture &lt;br /&gt;capital, and private equity investments in the roaring 1990s, and people were asking whether it should &lt;br /&gt;take on increased risk in an effort to narrow the gap.  Penn ranked very low at the time in endowment per &lt;br /&gt;student, a crucial metric.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Should Penn turn aggressive to make up the shortfall, or should it remain conservative to safeguard the &lt;br /&gt;limited resources it had?  In the spirit of the consultant’s matrix, should it increase its “willingness” &lt;br /&gt;despite the limits on its “ability”?  I convinced the people who mattered that (a) it was too late to start &lt;br /&gt;chasing a horse so long after it had left the barn and (b) the risk of continuing to underperform from such &lt;br /&gt;an elevated market level paled relative to the risk of participating in a bust after having missed the boom.  &lt;br /&gt;The consultant’s matrix might have been of help in that effort.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Moving on from the matrix, the consultant described some other interesting facets of the board’s attitude &lt;br /&gt;toward risk: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• 100% of the board members agreed – half “strongly agreed” – that exposure to risk is necessary if &lt;br /&gt;the plan wants to meet its objectives. &lt;br /&gt;• The consensus among board members was that they would feel worse about adopting an &lt;br /&gt;aggressive strategy and experiencing a market collapse than they would about being conservative &lt;br /&gt;and missing out on strong gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;• The board expressed a strong preference for bearing the “normal” risks stemming from market &lt;br /&gt;participation as opposed to the risks associated with an innovative but opaque approach that is &lt;br /&gt;projected to deliver returns accompanied by risk below the normal level. &lt;br /&gt;• All board members recognized that having true diversification means there may well be some &lt;br /&gt;laggards within the portfolio at all times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the consultant covered the most important aspects of risk bearing, and the board members’ &lt;br /&gt;views were reasonable.  Importantly, they recognize that their conservative bent may lead to under- &lt;br /&gt;performance in strong markets, but they explicitly prefer that to a more aggressive posture with its &lt;br /&gt;attendant risks.  This is probably the most important real-world consideration under the heading of risk &lt;br /&gt;attitudes.  Not everyone can live happily with the performance lags that conservatism can bring, but this &lt;br /&gt;board has had the opportunity to see that in action during the last two bullish years, and it seems to be &lt;br /&gt;sticking to the plot.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The board members accept that risk isn’t something to be avoided.  They’re not looking for the illusive &lt;br /&gt;black box that others say will give them return without risk.  And they understand that caution limits &lt;br /&gt;return potential – and that the staff shouldn’t be criticized for the presence of underperformers when the &lt;br /&gt;board says it wants diversification.  I found this discussion realistic and constructive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Setting Objectives &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The starting point for the consultant’s discussion of objectives was the ranking provided by the board &lt;br /&gt;members: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Determine the correct asset allocation. &lt;br /&gt;2. Hire managers that outperform. &lt;br /&gt;3. Beat the assumed rate of return. &lt;br /&gt;4. Increase risk at the right time. &lt;br /&gt;5. Outperform peers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed to see that the members ranked beating peers last among the plan’s possible &lt;br /&gt;objectives.  And they strongly disagreed with the idea that it’s okay to lose money when others do as long &lt;br /&gt;as you do well when others do.  When I heard this, I wrote down that we have to be careful when we &lt;br /&gt;think of investing as being like golf, in which it matters little what your score is – just whether it’s better &lt;br /&gt;than your opponent’s.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it’s common practice in the investment world to assess short-term investment performance in &lt;br /&gt;terms of how you’ve done relative to your peers and your benchmarks, in the long run (more on this &lt;br /&gt;later), the success of an entity like a pension plan isn’t reckoned in terms of whether it did better than &lt;br /&gt;others.  Success for a defined benefit pension plan means being able to pay benefits and minimize &lt;br /&gt;the cost to the plan sponsor.  Period.  If a plan is unable to pay promised benefits, it’s scant comfort that &lt;br /&gt;peer plans can’t either.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s the job of the board and staff to consider likely macro environments, establish an investment approach &lt;br /&gt;and strategy, and choose tactics and managers to create a portfolio that maximizes the probability of &lt;br /&gt;success over a reasonable range of possible scenarios.  There’s not a word there about doing it better &lt;br /&gt;than others.  If an unforeseeable macro environment unfolds in a way that renders the plan unable to pay &lt;br /&gt;benefits, that failure, even if an understandable one and shared by others, is still a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I think it’s important to note that if, on the other hand, the plan does end up with enough money to &lt;br /&gt;pay benefits, that doesn’t necessarily mean its board and staff did a good job.  Before coming to that &lt;br /&gt;conclusion, one would need to gauge how the portfolio would have done if a different environment had &lt;br /&gt;unfolded – that is, to consider “alternative histories” in the way proposed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in &lt;br /&gt;Fooled by Randomness.  If the portfolio wouldn’t have done well under other scenarios, the plan’s ability &lt;br /&gt;to pay benefits might be attributed solely to the fact that the one that unfolded did so.  In that case, the &lt;br /&gt;plan’s success might be more a matter of luck than skill.  But this isn’t an easy analysis to perform. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the Subject of Volatility &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was very glad to hear that the board members ranked the Sharpe ratio last among six possible &lt;br /&gt;performance metrics and on average considered avoiding volatility in the sponsor’s contributions less of a &lt;br /&gt;priority than the ability to pay benefits or attain fully funded status.  Most of the members thought it was &lt;br /&gt;important to balance stable contributions and the pursuit of high returns, although some did rank &lt;br /&gt;contribution stability higher than the level of return.  Obviously, this is a challenging question for a board &lt;br /&gt;concerned with both the need to pay benefits and the desire to limit the cost to the sponsor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In future memos, I’m likely to harp on my view that investors pay too much attention to volatility.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s absolutely essential for investors to think about limiting their risk, but I don’t think volatility is &lt;br /&gt;the risk they should be most concerned with.  Regardless, much of the investing community has &lt;br /&gt;accepted volatility as the best indicator of risk – primarily, I think, because it’s the only way to come up &lt;br /&gt;with a number for risk – and that has led to excessive attention being paid to it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll make a controversial statement here: in pure investment terms, there’s no intrinsic reason for &lt;br /&gt;long-term investors to be concerned with volatility (as distinguished from the risk of permanent &lt;br /&gt;loss).  Warren Buffett famously says he’d “rather earn a lumpy 15% return than a smooth 12%.”  Why &lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t everyone?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the main reasons for concern over fluctuating market prices are situational, institutional, &lt;br /&gt;political, career-related, psychological, and emotional.  I call these things “externalities,” and because &lt;br /&gt;they’re external to the investment process, a potentially volatile investment can be risky for some &lt;br /&gt;investors and not for others.  For example: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• An AI stock can be a risky holding for the manager of a mutual fund that’s priced daily and &lt;br /&gt;subject to daily withdrawals – or for an investor who’s likely to panic during a market crash and &lt;br /&gt;sell at the bottom – but much less so for a sovereign wealth fund where the money is unlikely to &lt;br /&gt;be withdrawn and there’s no requirement to publish financials and satisfy public opinion. &lt;br /&gt;• An investor whose compensation is based on metrics that penalize volatility may consider a &lt;br /&gt;publicly traded bond riskier than a private loan from the same issuer that doesn’t mark to market, &lt;br /&gt;even though the risk of default is the same for both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it’s true that an asset’s volatility can bring risk for some investors but not others, then clearly the &lt;br /&gt;risk doesn’t lie in the investment, but in something in the investor’s environment.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I think the risk of permanent loss is the most important investment risk, I recognize that volatility &lt;br /&gt;can be a material real-world risk for some investors.  My experience with the pension fund session &lt;br /&gt;reminded me that rapidly fluctuating portfolio values can require fluctuating contributions from pension &lt;br /&gt;plan sponsors.  This may be an externality relative to the process of estimating the intrinsic value of &lt;br /&gt;potential investments and assessing their potential returns and risks, but it’s a completely legitimate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;consideration for people with responsibility for pension plans.  It’s absolutely internal to them and their &lt;br /&gt;process.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, of course, pension funds are but one example of the type of investor who may consider volatility a &lt;br /&gt;risk.  University endowments are another example.  Typically, universities rely upon an annual “draw” &lt;br /&gt;from the endowment to fund a material portion of their operating expenses.  Volatility in the value of the &lt;br /&gt;endowment can affect the amount of that draw and require unplanned changes to a university’s &lt;br /&gt;operations.  We saw this very clearly when the Global Financial Crisis hit in 2008. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Choice of Investment Approach &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The consultant did a good job of covering questions regarding strategies and tactics, and the board gave &lt;br /&gt;good answers.  Here are a few of the areas they touched on: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• All board members agreed that it’s impossible to foresee the future, and thus that the portfolio &lt;br /&gt;should be built to prepare for “all environments” rather than base performance expectations on &lt;br /&gt;the ability to time markets.  Of course this is the right attitude, even though it’s impossible to (a) &lt;br /&gt;specify “all environments” or (b) build a portfolio that entails the risk inherent in investing but is &lt;br /&gt;capable of performing well in all environments. &lt;br /&gt;• A substantial majority of the members said they’re comfortable with using leverage at 15-20% of &lt;br /&gt;the plan’s assets.  I think this is reasonable.  A well-funded plan that’s sponsored by a financially &lt;br /&gt;strong employer and invested conservatively should be able to withstand the uncertainties &lt;br /&gt;associated with this level of leverage.  While most public plans may not use leverage, I think it &lt;br /&gt;makes sense for this one.  However, (a) it’s still essential to deal with the risk of the lender pulling &lt;br /&gt;the leverage at a bad time in the investment and capital markets and (b) paying interest to borrow &lt;br /&gt;makes it even more important that the plan not hold a lot of assets whose only merit is a highly &lt;br /&gt;dependable low return (or, in this case, a return below its borrowing cost).  &lt;br /&gt;• A slimmer majority backed putting 25% of the portfolio into illiquid assets “assuming all benefit &lt;br /&gt;payments and foreseen funding requirements can be met.”  However, a few thought a higher &lt;br /&gt;promised return isn’t a good reason for surrendering flexibility.  Clearly, some part of a well-&lt;br /&gt;funded plan’s assets can reasonably be illiquid, but getting that percentage right is no simple &lt;br /&gt;matter.   &lt;br /&gt;• Slightly more members were in favor of focusing exclusively on expected returns net of fees, &lt;br /&gt;while a few thought minimization of fees should be a goal in itself.  This is a tough area.  No one &lt;br /&gt;wants to pay high fees and not get above average performance.  But when you sign up for a fund &lt;br /&gt;with stiff fees, the performance is hoped for while the fees are a sure thing.  All you have to do is &lt;br /&gt;figure out which high-fee funds are likely to deliver and which aren’t.  Not an easy task.  It would &lt;br /&gt;be interesting to see a study of the correlation between plan portfolios’ average fees paid and their &lt;br /&gt;performance, but I never have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these positions make sense for this plan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Assessing Performance  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The consultant asked the board members which performance standards they think are most important and &lt;br /&gt;reported that the board members considered achieving the actuarial assumption the most important thing; &lt;br /&gt;beating the policy benchmark and having managers beat their respective benchmarks were secondary; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;beating peers and popular indices like the S&amp;P 500 were deemed relatively unimportant.  I think they &lt;br /&gt;have their priorities right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When it was my turn to speak, I got more questions on how to assess the performance of the investment &lt;br /&gt;operation than anything else.  This is one of the toughest questions in our business.  I’ll summarize below &lt;br /&gt;what I said and add a lot that I should have said. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s absolutely true that the thing that matters most is whether the plan achieves the rate of return the &lt;br /&gt;actuaries accurately project is necessary: that is, for today’s capital and the expected capital contributions &lt;br /&gt;to reach the sum needed to pay future benefits.  So, if the plan’s actuarial assumption is 6¼%, what &lt;br /&gt;matters most is whether the board and staff can achieve that over the long term.  But the board and staff &lt;br /&gt;have to assess whether the investment approach is working over much shorter periods and, in &lt;br /&gt;particular, they have to decide on raises, promotions, and personnel retention every year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The challenge in assessing performance in this regard stems from the fact that making 6¼% may be &lt;br /&gt;the only thing that matters in the long run but absolutely irrelevant in the short run.  If the 60/40 &lt;br /&gt;balanced portfolio, the policy portfolio, or the peer average is up 20% next year, achieving 6¼% can’t be &lt;br /&gt;described as success.  And if those relative benchmarks are down 20% next year, making 6¼% is &lt;br /&gt;probably an unreasonable criterion.  In other words, achieving the actuarial assumption in any given &lt;br /&gt;year or even over a few years isn’t a useful standard for performance assessment over those &lt;br /&gt;periods. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the appropriate standard for performance measurement in the short or perhaps the &lt;br /&gt;intermediate term has to be a relative one, not absolute.  In the short term, we have no choice other &lt;br /&gt;than to assess performance in light of what reasonably could have been accomplished in the &lt;br /&gt;environment that unfolded.  The key question is “should we have done better?” and the best way to &lt;br /&gt;answer it is probably by looking at how others did who were similarly situated.  So, again ironically, &lt;br /&gt;the right standard is likely, “how did our peers do?”  After all, if they’re really our peers, they probably &lt;br /&gt;have similar goals, are subject to similar constraints, and were presented with a similar menu of potential &lt;br /&gt;investments as we were.  For this reason, their performance may be the best short-term benchmark against &lt;br /&gt;which to measure ours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this isn’t a perfect standard either.  For example, if our portfolio goes up as much as our peers’ &lt;br /&gt;portfolios in a bubblish market, that may merely mean our portfolio was as imprudent as theirs.  Similarly, &lt;br /&gt;if everyone else loses a lot in bad times, going down almost as much probably means we screwed up also, &lt;br /&gt;and that’s no reason for congratulations and raises.  But if we can beat our peers in bad times and do &lt;br /&gt;almost as well or better in good times, that may be the most solid reason for awarding high marks.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, we can use the policy portfolio for these assessments instead of peer performance, but then the &lt;br /&gt;people who set the policy portfolio are let off the hook.  The policy portfolio is a possible standard for &lt;br /&gt;assessment, but what’s to say it’s a good one?  If the policy portfolio excludes alternatives when they &lt;br /&gt;should have been considered for inclusion, as in the Penn endowment example above, you might beat the &lt;br /&gt;policy benchmark but fail to keep up with what the environment afforded.  In the end, I think what this &lt;br /&gt;discussion proves isn’t that one standard for assessment is better than the others, but that there is &lt;br /&gt;no standard that’s free of deficiencies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that leads to the question of the proper period for assessing performance.  The trouble with using the &lt;br /&gt;actuarial assumption as the criterion is that, in the short run, too many factors are in play for performance &lt;br /&gt;versus the assumption to be a clear indicator of whether a portfolio was managed skillfully.  As suggested &lt;br /&gt;above, performance in an individual year will be heavily influenced by whether the market was strong or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 &lt;br /&gt;© 2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. All Rights Reserved &lt;br /&gt; Follow us:     &lt;br /&gt;weak, and especially by whether the investors driving it were mindlessly optimistic or panicked.  Further, &lt;br /&gt;the market’s performance might have been dictated by a single unforeseeable event.  Is it reasonable to &lt;br /&gt;hold staff responsible for not having foreseen it?  We all know a single year isn’t a reasonable basis for &lt;br /&gt;determining investment skill.  But what should the period be? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In asking this question, most people want to be given a number of years: perhaps three, five, eight, or ten.  &lt;br /&gt;But the correct answer can’t be a fixed number.  Given the large number of factors that influence &lt;br /&gt;performance, the assessment period has to be long enough for these things to even out, long enough for &lt;br /&gt;that one freak occurrence to dissipate, and long enough so that the performance of the portfolio in &lt;br /&gt;both bullish and bearish environments can be assessed.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If performance is assessed over a period that includes only good times – like the last 16 years (save for a &lt;br /&gt;few relatively short dips) – the prize for performance is likely to go to those investors with the most risk-&lt;br /&gt;prone portfolios.  In such an environment, keeping up with or surpassing the benchmarks may not be a &lt;br /&gt;sign of investment skill, but rather extreme risk tolerance.  Likewise, beating the benchmarks or the peers &lt;br /&gt;in a declining market may only be a sign of above average risk aversion, not the ability of a portfolio to &lt;br /&gt;achieve a superior risk-adjusted return over the long run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, the answer is that an appropriate performance assessment period has to include both good &lt;br /&gt;times and bad.  In other words, it should cover a full market cycle.  That’s the only way to distinguish &lt;br /&gt;investment skill (including the ability to tilt conservative or aggressive at the right times) from a mere &lt;br /&gt;bias toward aggressiveness or defensiveness.  On this subject, this is by far the most important thing.  &lt;br /&gt;Defining a full cycle can be problematic, particularly as economic cycles seem to have lengthened &lt;br /&gt;recently, but it should be possible to have a sense for whether a given period includes both good times and &lt;br /&gt;bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally on the subject of performance assessment, I suggested that the board consider the level of &lt;br /&gt;personnel turnover.  It’s not that personnel turnover is always a black mark; some is completely &lt;br /&gt;understandable.  For example, no hiring process can be expected to work perfectly, meaning every &lt;br /&gt;organization will have to weed out subpar performers.  Further, we know compensation is limited in the &lt;br /&gt;public plan arena, so good performers are likely to be given opportunities to move to the private sector; in &lt;br /&gt;this way, losing employees can be a sign that the hiring process identified good performers.  But above &lt;br /&gt;average personnel turnover may be indicative of a poor hiring process, an unreasonable performance &lt;br /&gt;assessment process, or poor management practices.  At minimum, these possibilities must be considered. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In general, I very much liked what I heard in the session, and I think these are the most important &lt;br /&gt;observations: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• The board members are happy to take less than 100% of the risk the plan’s finances might permit. &lt;br /&gt;• They prefer to forego some return potential in order to avoid the full force of market declines. &lt;br /&gt;• They have little concern for their ranking within their peer group.   &lt;br /&gt;• They have relatively little interest in volatility-adjusted performance metrics. &lt;br /&gt;• They’re rightly concerned about how to assess the performance of the investment team and the &lt;br /&gt;portfolio they produce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients&lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Best of . . .&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate 35 years of my memos, I’m thrilled to release this collection of the ones I think are the best.&lt;br /&gt;These memos fall primarily into two categories.  Some set out what I consider the enduring truths of investing &lt;br /&gt;– fr om the nee  d for second-level thinking to the importance of risk control, the inevitability of cycles, and&lt;br /&gt;the futility of macro forecasting.  Others &lt;br /&gt;chronicle the most impactful financial eve nts of the last three&lt;br /&gt;decades: the dot-com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis, and the sea change in interest rate policy that took&lt;br /&gt;place in 2022.&lt;br /&gt;Writi&lt;br /&gt;ng the memos is an absolute joy for me.  They serve as the vehicle through whic h I share my thinking &lt;br /&gt;with the investment community,  all ow me to connect with Oaktree’s clie  nts and employees, and serve as my &lt;br /&gt;creative outlet.  I plan to keep at it. &lt;br /&gt;October 12, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;br /&gt;The Route to Performance&lt;br /&gt;October 12, 1990&lt;br /&gt;The Route to Performance is the first memo I wrote.  It articulates what would later become a core &lt;br /&gt;part of Oaktree’s investment philosophy: that long-term investment success is best achieved through &lt;br /&gt;a string of consistently good returns and an absence of poor years, rather than by aiming for brilliant &lt;br /&gt;successes, getting there in some years and flopping in others.&lt;br /&gt;First Quarter Performance&lt;br /&gt;April 11, 1991&lt;br /&gt;In the first quarter of 1991, markets swung from extreme pessimism toward more reasonable &lt;br /&gt;sentiment, leading to excellent performance for sub-investment grade credit.  The pendulum-like &lt;br /&gt;fluctuation between optimism and pessimism, fear and greed, and risk tolerance and risk aversion &lt;br /&gt;remains one of the most dependable features of the investment world.&lt;br /&gt;How the Game Should Be Played&lt;br /&gt;May 26, 1995&lt;br /&gt;Using sports metaphors to illustrate Oaktree’s investment philosophy, I describe how our “game plan” &lt;br /&gt;is directed at avoiding strikeouts and achieving a high batting average over time, not at swinging for &lt;br /&gt;the fences on every trip to the plate. &lt;br /&gt;bubble.com &lt;br /&gt;January 2, 2000&lt;br /&gt;This was the first of my memos to engender any response from readers!  It describes the psychology &lt;br /&gt;of market bubbles in the context of a dot-com boom that would shortly become a dot-com bust when &lt;br /&gt;equity valuations fueled by excessive belief in the “the new, new thing” fell back to earth.&lt;br /&gt;What’s It All About, Alpha? &lt;br /&gt;July 11, 2001&lt;br /&gt;In this memo, I reconcile the investment theory I was taught at the University of Chicago with the &lt;br /&gt;reality I encountered in the real world.  I provide my take on alpha, beta, risk and return, and, most &lt;br /&gt;importantly, market efficiency – and the key implications for investors.  If you swallow the efficient &lt;br /&gt;market hypothesis, you shouldn’t be an active investor.  But if you ignore it, you’re likely to make &lt;br /&gt;critical mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;You Can’t Predict.  You Can Prepare.&lt;br /&gt;November 20, 2001&lt;br /&gt;This is my first memo focused on the importance of economic and market cycles and the limits on &lt;br /&gt;knowledge of the macro future.  It outlines a concept that permeates all Oaktree investment activity: &lt;br /&gt;we may never know where we’re going, but we ought to know where we are, and that knowledge of &lt;br /&gt;today’s environment should determine our response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;The Realist’s Creed&lt;br /&gt;May 31, 2002&lt;br /&gt;This memo serves as an acknowledgement that “I don’t know” is often the only reasonable refrain. &lt;br /&gt;Itencourages investors to eschew macro forecasts and instead focus their attention on evaluating &lt;br /&gt;fundamentals and developing specialized expertise. &lt;br /&gt;What’s Your Game Plan?&lt;br /&gt;September 5, 2003&lt;br /&gt;This was my second memo dedicated to the parallels between investing and sports, employing &lt;br /&gt;anecdotes from tennis and baseball and emphasizing Oaktree’s motto from the beginning: “if we &lt;br /&gt;avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves.”&lt;br /&gt;Us and Them&lt;br /&gt;May 7, 2004&lt;br /&gt;This memo highlights the contrast between two styles of investors: the “I know” school – confident, &lt;br /&gt;aggressive, and forecast-driven, and the “I don’t know” school – consistent, risk-conscious, and &lt;br /&gt;focused on fundamentals.  I look closely at personality types, attitudes toward the market, and other &lt;br /&gt;aspects of these investment styles. &lt;br /&gt;Hedge Funds: A Case for Caution&lt;br /&gt;October 6, 2004&lt;br /&gt;I set out my thoughts on the hedge fund movement – the hot topic in the investment world at the time &lt;br /&gt;–looking at aspects such as scalability and performance.  Importantly, I say, nobody should credit&lt;br /&gt;any asset class (including hedge funds) with the birthright of a return.  It all comes down to whether&lt;br /&gt;mispriced investment opportunities are available and whether the investor has the skill required to&lt;br /&gt;identify them.&lt;br /&gt;Risk &lt;br /&gt;January 19, 2006&lt;br /&gt;I discuss what risk really means (not volatility!), why it matters, how to think about measuring it, and &lt;br /&gt;much more.  Ultimately, it’s investors’ job to bear risk in the pursuit of profit.  To do so wisely, they &lt;br /&gt;must understand risk and, of course, ascertain that they’re well compensated before deciding to bear &lt;br /&gt;it.  But they can’t simply avoid it and hope for great returns. &lt;br /&gt;Returns and How They Get That Way&lt;br /&gt;November 11, 2002&lt;br /&gt;Here I express my view as to where equity returns come from – either growth in earnings or an &lt;br /&gt;upgrading of how investors value those earnings – and my belief that relying on the latter might not &lt;br /&gt;work in the long run.  I also provide my thoughts on a tougher question; how to judge whether a &lt;br /&gt;manager truly possesses skill given the presence of significant randomness in the investment world. &lt;br /&gt;You can guess what I look for: a long record of consistent but possibly modest outperformance, &lt;br /&gt;rather than occasional flashes of brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;The New Paradigm&lt;br /&gt;October 19, 2006&lt;br /&gt;In this memo, I discuss what can happen to managers’ motivations when vast sums become &lt;br /&gt;available for management in an asset class, with the accompanying ballooning of potential &lt;br /&gt;management fees.  Looking at developments in buyout funds, the real estate market, and credit &lt;br /&gt;investing, I conclude that it’s a good time for increased caution. &lt;br /&gt;Pigweed &lt;br /&gt;December 7, 2006&lt;br /&gt;A memo about the meltdown of a hedge fund called Amaranth Advisors, in which I parse the events &lt;br /&gt;surrounding its collapse.  The fund had been making aggressive bets, and its successes were &lt;br /&gt;mistaken for long-term skill instead of than the reality: short-term luck.  As usual, the prospect of &lt;br /&gt;exceptional profit earned with limited risk turned out to be a chimera. &lt;br /&gt;The Race to the Bottom&lt;br /&gt;February 14, 2007&lt;br /&gt;This memo describes what happens when investors have too much money to invest and they’re too &lt;br /&gt;eager to put it to work.  It represents a timely warning about the capital market behavior that &lt;br /&gt;ultimately led to the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2007 and the ensuing Global Financial Crisis.&lt;br /&gt;It’s All Good&lt;br /&gt;July 16, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The “all-good trilogy” offers a reminder that good times are unlikely to last forever.  In It’s All Good, I &lt;br /&gt;highlight a few worrisome developments I’d spotted in the market: excessive use of leverage, &lt;br /&gt;untested securitization structures, and too-easy access to capital.  We all know what happened next. &lt;br /&gt;It’s All Good... Really?&lt;br /&gt;July 30, 2007&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel, I describe how the events of July 2007 exemplify the elements that usually serve to &lt;br /&gt;initiate the swing back of the market pendulum.  It’s important to study the way it happened, because &lt;br /&gt;while it’s folly to think we can know in advance what will cause the market to stop swinging in one &lt;br /&gt;direction and start in the other, it’s even more unwise to think that time-honored pattern won’t repeat.&lt;br /&gt;Dare to Be Great&lt;br /&gt;September 7, 2006&lt;br /&gt;One of the first and most fundamental decisions for investors is with regard to the question of how far &lt;br /&gt;out on a limb they’ll venture.  This memo reflects my thoughts on how investment management &lt;br /&gt;clients might best pursue superior results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;The Limits to Negativism&lt;br /&gt;October 15, 2008&lt;br /&gt;This record of the fickleness of investor psychology was written very close to the absolute bottom in &lt;br /&gt;the investor sentiment.  It describes the violent collapse of investor psychology that followed the &lt;br /&gt;bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, bringing on the Global Financial Crisis.  The environment from 2003-&lt;br /&gt;07 had been one of excessive positivity, but in 2008 I found it impossible to make assumptions &lt;br /&gt;negative enough to satisfy some onlookers.  This excessive negativity signaled to me that there were &lt;br /&gt;vast opportunities for the stalwart contrarian. &lt;br /&gt;Volatility + Leverage = Dynamite&lt;br /&gt;December 17, 2008&lt;br /&gt;It was levered mortgage-backed securities that were mostly responsible for the Global Financial &lt;br /&gt;Crisis, and I wrote this memo to explain that the amount of leverage it’s prudent to use is largely a &lt;br /&gt;function of the riskiness and volatility of the assets it’s used to purchase and the staying power of the &lt;br /&gt;asset holder.  The combination of risky assets and excessive leverage under the wrong &lt;br /&gt;circumstances can prove fatal. &lt;br /&gt;All That Glitters&lt;br /&gt;December 17, 2010&lt;br /&gt;This memo incorporated all my thoughts about investing in gold.  I outlined its pros and cons but &lt;br /&gt;ended up expressing the view that there’s no way to quantify the intrinsic value of assets like gold &lt;br /&gt;that don’t produce cash flow, and thus no way to invest in them analytically.  Gold has worked as a &lt;br /&gt;store of value solely because people agreed it would.  That’s not much of a foundation for a prudent &lt;br /&gt;investment.&lt;br /&gt;Déjà Vu All Over Again&lt;br /&gt;March 19, 2012&lt;br /&gt;An exploration of the importance of historical awareness in prudent investing.  The lessons of history &lt;br /&gt;are regularly forgotten when market sentiment becomes excessively optimistic or pessimistic.  As &lt;br /&gt;these are the best times for applying a contrarian approach, ignoring historical patterns can be &lt;br /&gt;dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;Now It’s All Bad?&lt;br /&gt;September 10, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Just six weeks later, I discussed how rapidly market sentiment had shifted.  In this case, a cascade of &lt;br /&gt;negative events – coming on top of too much leverage and not enough liquidity – led to a complete &lt;br /&gt;reversal of investor psychology.  Before the collapse, some market participants believed they’d tamed &lt;br /&gt;risk.  Well, risk bit back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;Getting Lucky &lt;br /&gt;January 16, 2014&lt;br /&gt;In this memo, the most popular through that time, I emphasize how big a part luck plays in both life &lt;br /&gt;and investing.  This challenges the idea that success is always the result of hard work and skill and &lt;br /&gt;highlights the importance of acknowledging factors beyond one’s control.&lt;br /&gt;Dare to Be Great II&lt;br /&gt;April 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Building on Dare to Be Great, written eight years earlier, this memo reiterates that unconventional &lt;br /&gt;behavior is the only route to superior investment results, although it’s far from sure to work.  To &lt;br /&gt;engage in it, you have to dare to be different, dare to be wrong, and dare to look wrong for a while &lt;br /&gt;even when you’re right.  This isn’t easy, and that’s why not everyone can take the steps needed for &lt;br /&gt;investment superiority. &lt;br /&gt;Risk Revisited Again &lt;br /&gt;June 8, 2015&lt;br /&gt;A treatise on the essence of investment risk, this memo stresses that whereas in our world risk is &lt;br /&gt;often defined as volatility, it really ensues from the fact that there is a range of possible outcomes &lt;br /&gt;from every investment, and it can include some that might be unpleasant.  Importantly, risk can’t be &lt;br /&gt;reduced to a number and managed by algorithm.  Doing a superior job of it requires superior insight.&lt;br /&gt;It’s Not Easy&lt;br /&gt;September 9, 2015&lt;br /&gt;In 2011, Charlie Munger told me, “none of this is easy.”  I used that phrase as the title for a memo &lt;br /&gt;stressing that superior investing requires superior insight, plus the willingness to deviate from the &lt;br /&gt;herd, the ability to control one’s emotions, and an unrelenting emphasis on the defining role of price &lt;br /&gt;in investment decisions. &lt;br /&gt;It’s All a Big Mistake&lt;br /&gt;June 20, 2012&lt;br /&gt;It’s rarely understood that for a buyer to make a bargain purchase, the seller has to sell too cheap.  &lt;br /&gt;This memo explains that buying at a fair price doesn’t generate alpha – it’s buying at an &lt;br /&gt;unreasonably low one that does.  Thus, accessing a bargain requires cooperation from someone &lt;br /&gt;who’ll sell at a price that’s irrationally low . . . but don’t despair; sometimes they do.  We must try to &lt;br /&gt;be the one who profits from these mistakes rather than the one who commits them! &lt;br /&gt;The Outlook for Equities&lt;br /&gt;March 13, 2013&lt;br /&gt;The defining difference between bonds and stocks is that you can’t compute prospective returns for &lt;br /&gt;the latter.  One of the few reliable indicators I find for prospective equity returns is that the better &lt;br /&gt;returns have been in the recent past, the less good they’re likely to be in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;This Time It’s Different&lt;br /&gt;June 12, 2019&lt;br /&gt;In good times, the notion that “this time it’s different” often works its way into the marketplace as &lt;br /&gt;investors use it to justify soaring prices for popular assets.  This sentiment can be expressed in &lt;br /&gt;contexts ranging from questioning the possibility of a recession to supporting the high valuations of &lt;br /&gt;unproven companies dealing in the latest miracle.  This memo discusses the outlook for nine such &lt;br /&gt;theories and how things would truly have to be different for them to prove out.&lt;br /&gt;You Bet!&lt;br /&gt;January 13, 2020&lt;br /&gt;Here I build on the counterintuitive principle that you can’t tell the quality of a decision from its &lt;br /&gt;outcome, and that the presence of randomness means well-thought-out decisions may fail and poor &lt;br /&gt;decisions may succeed.  In investing, superior skill will overcome the impact of luck in the long run, &lt;br /&gt;but in the short run, luck can swamp skill, and the two can be indistinguishable. &lt;br /&gt;Uncertainty &lt;br /&gt;May 11, 2020&lt;br /&gt;Against the confounding backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, a reminder that forecasting is futile and &lt;br /&gt;we must admit the limitations on our knowledge.  The things we know about the macro environment &lt;br /&gt;generally are of no use in gaining an edge – because everyone else knows them too! &lt;br /&gt;Uncertainty II &lt;br /&gt;May 28, 2020&lt;br /&gt;This memo builds on Uncertainty as the pandemic continues to rage, but with an important addition: &lt;br /&gt;not only do most people lack sufficient expertise to achieve superiority, but they also lack the &lt;br /&gt;expertise needed to identify which “experts” do possess it.  While individuals often seek comfort in &lt;br /&gt;the output of reputable forecasters, they usually end up disappointed but rarely acknowledge the core &lt;br /&gt;problem: that macro forecasts are seldom helpful. &lt;br /&gt;On the Couch&lt;br /&gt;January 14, 2016&lt;br /&gt;This memo was my attempt to send the markets for a visit to the physiatrist and explore what might &lt;br /&gt;be learned there, analyzing investors’ irrationality and discussing why many of the things that seem &lt;br /&gt;obvious to most investors so often turn out to be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;What Does the Market Know?&lt;br /&gt;January 19, 2016&lt;br /&gt;When people responded to On the Couch by asking whether I was sure the market wasn’t sending a &lt;br /&gt;sell signal, I addressed the error of taking advice from the market.  Most of the time, the market’s &lt;br /&gt;short-term behavior stems from irrational swings of investor perception “from hopeless to flawless,” &lt;br /&gt;rather than a dispassionate weighing of merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;The Illusion of Knowledge&lt;br /&gt;September 8, 2022&lt;br /&gt;A huge number of factors must be correctly predicted in order for a macro forecast to be accurate.  &lt;br /&gt;As no forecast can be better than the ability of its algorithm to capture the workings of an incredibly &lt;br /&gt;complex world, why would anyone expect their forecast to be more accurate than the rest? &lt;br /&gt;What Really Matters?&lt;br /&gt;November 22, 2022&lt;br /&gt;This memo argues that short-term performance, hyperactivity, and volatility don’t matter; instead, &lt;br /&gt;what I call “asymmetry” is the cornerstone of investing excellence.  Superior investors achieve &lt;br /&gt;success by delivering returns that are more than commensurate with the risk they bear.  This requires &lt;br /&gt;superior skill and insight, attributes that only the best possess. &lt;br /&gt;Sea Change&lt;br /&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully a seminal memo, Sea Change reviews the impact of 40 years of declining interest rates, &lt;br /&gt;brought to a halt by the need to fight post-pandemic inflation.  This leads to an important observation: &lt;br /&gt;when the investing environment undergoes fundamental change, one’s strategy must undergo a &lt;br /&gt;thorough review. &lt;br /&gt;Something of Value &lt;br /&gt;January 11, 2021&lt;br /&gt;In Something of Value, I say how valuable it was to have my son Andrew and his family move in with &lt;br /&gt;us during the pandemic, and I highlight the seeming divide between “value” and “growth” investing as &lt;br /&gt;a potentially false dichotomy.  In an investment environment marked by fewer bargains and greater &lt;br /&gt;efficiency than the one I grew up in, value investors shouldn’t limit themselves to bottom-fishing and &lt;br /&gt;instead should expand their toolbox and think about ‘‘winners” too. &lt;br /&gt;I Beg to Differ &lt;br /&gt;July 26, 2022&lt;br /&gt;This memo returns to the idea that investors seeking superior performance must have the courage to &lt;br /&gt;depart from the pack.  Thinking differently and better than others is essential, because to outperform &lt;br /&gt;in investing, it’s not enough to be right.  You have to be more right than most. &lt;br /&gt;Taking the Temperature &lt;br /&gt;July 10, 2023&lt;br /&gt;A look back at my five main market calls.  Making such calls isn’t common practice for me, but I &lt;br /&gt;made each of the five because I found the market crazily elevated or depressed.  They weren’t based &lt;br /&gt;on crunching financial data or on expertise regarding the specific investments in question, but on the &lt;br /&gt;clear-eyed assessment of investor psychology.  Having identified these extremes, I felt comfortable &lt;br /&gt;calling for an adjustment of Oaktree’s risk posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview (continued)&lt;br /&gt;The Indispensability of Risk&lt;br /&gt;April 17, 2024&lt;br /&gt;With investors facing intelligent competitors, as we do every day, no one should expect to achieve &lt;br /&gt;significant returns without bearing risk.  But they also shouldn’t expect to achieve them simply for &lt;br /&gt;bearing risk.  It has to be done consciously and skillfully.&lt;br /&gt;Ruminating on Asset Allocation&lt;br /&gt;October 22, 2024&lt;br /&gt;This memo offers my articulation of the fundamental difference between equity and debt: a generous &lt;br /&gt;but uncertain expected return with both upside and downside potential from the former, versus a &lt;br /&gt;more modest contractual return accompanied by much less uncertainty from the latter.  This &lt;br /&gt;difference is the essential consideration in portfolio construction, in which investors must determine &lt;br /&gt;their appropriate risk posture and combine ownership and lending assets in a portfolio that gets them &lt;br /&gt;there. &lt;br /&gt;The Calculus of Value&lt;br /&gt;August 13, 2025&lt;br /&gt;An assessment of the essence of value and price and the critical relationship between the two.  &lt;br /&gt;Iargue that in the long run, increases in value – usually stemming from growth in earnings – provide &lt;br /&gt;most of the impetus for investment returns, and value exerts a magnetic influence on price.  That &lt;br /&gt;means the current relationship of price to value should be expected to strongly influence future &lt;br /&gt;investment performance, with high valuations presaging low subsequent returns, and vice versa. &lt;br /&gt;Fewer Losers, or More Winners?&lt;br /&gt;September 12, 2023&lt;br /&gt;In the pursuit of superior risk-adjusted returns (or winning tennis), a participant’s game plan requires &lt;br /&gt;choosing between the two main paths: either experiencing fewer losers or finding more winners.  &lt;br /&gt;Iargue that in credit, having fewer losers will generally serve best, but smart credit investing should &lt;br /&gt;be based on risk control, not risk avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum to Third Quarter Client Letter &lt;br /&gt;From:  Howard S. Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Route to Performance &lt;br /&gt;We all seek investment performance which is above average, but how to achieve it &lt;br /&gt;rem&lt;br /&gt;ains a major question.  My views on the subject have come increasingly into focus as &lt;br /&gt;the years have gone by, and two events in late September -- and especially their &lt;br /&gt;juxtaposition -- made it even clearer how (and how not) to best pursue those superior &lt;br /&gt;results. &lt;br /&gt;First, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal about a prominent money &lt;br /&gt;management firm's lagging performance.  Its equity results were 1,840 basis points &lt;br /&gt;behind the S&amp;P 500 for the twelve months through August, and as a result its five-year &lt;br /&gt;performance had fallen behind the S&amp;P as well.  The president of the firm explained that &lt;br /&gt;its bold over- and under-weightings weren't wrong, just too early.  Here is his &lt;br /&gt;explanation, with which I strongly disagree: &lt;br /&gt;If you want to be in the top 5% of money managers, &lt;br /&gt;you have to be willing to be in the bottom 5%, too. &lt;br /&gt;The above calls to mind a convertible mutual fund I discussed in my second quarter 1988 &lt;br /&gt;letter to convertible clients.  The fund held large amounts of common stock in the first &lt;br /&gt;eight months of 1987 and cash after that.  As a result, its return was more than 1,600 &lt;br /&gt;basis points better than the average convertible fund for the year, and 945 b.p. ahead of &lt;br /&gt;the second-place fund. In the next half year, its tactics were equally divergent ... but &lt;br /&gt;wrong this time, producing performance which was far enough behind to negate the &lt;br /&gt;majority of its 1987 achievement and pull its 18-month results well back into the pack.  &lt;br /&gt;My observation at that time mirrored the fund manager quoted above, but from a negative &lt;br /&gt;viewpoint: &lt;br /&gt;.  .  .  in order to strive for performance which &lt;br /&gt;is far different from the norm and better, you &lt;br /&gt;must do things which expose you to the possibility &lt;br /&gt;of being far different from the norm and worse. &lt;br /&gt;These cases illustrate that bold steps taken in pursuit of&lt;br /&gt; great performance can just as &lt;br /&gt;easily be wrong as right.  Even worse, a combination of far above-average and far below-&lt;br /&gt;average years can lead to a long-term record which is characterized by volatility &lt;br /&gt;UandU &lt;br /&gt;mediocrity. &lt;br /&gt;As an alternative, I would like to cite the approach of a major mid-West pension plan &lt;br /&gt;whose director I spoke w&lt;br /&gt;ith last month.  The return on the plan's equities over the last &lt;br /&gt;1990 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fourteen years, under the direction of this man and his predecessors, has been way ahead &lt;br /&gt;of the S&amp;P 500.  He shared with me what he considered the key: &lt;br /&gt;We have never had a ye&lt;br /&gt;ar below the 47th percentile over that period or, until &lt;br /&gt;1990, above the 27th percentile.  As a result, we are in the fourth percentile for &lt;br /&gt;the fourteen year period as a whole. &lt;br /&gt;I feel strongly that attempting to achieve a superior long term record by stringing together &lt;br /&gt;a run of top-decile years is unlikely to succeed.  Rather, striving to do a little better than &lt;br /&gt;average every year -- and through discipline to have highly superior relative results in bad &lt;br /&gt;times -- is: &lt;br /&gt;-  less likely to produce extreme volatility,&lt;br /&gt;-  less likely to produce huge losses which can't be&lt;br /&gt;recouped and, most importantly,  &lt;br /&gt;-  more likely to work (given the fact that all of us are&lt;br /&gt;      only human). &lt;br /&gt;Simply put, what the pension fund'&lt;br /&gt;s record tells me is that, in equities, if you can avoid &lt;br /&gt;losers (and losing years), the winners will take care of themselves.  I believe most &lt;br /&gt;strongly that this holds true in my group's opportunistic niches as well -- that the best &lt;br /&gt;foundation for above-average long term performance is an absence of disasters.  It is for &lt;br /&gt;this reason that a quest for consistency and protection, not single-year greatness, is a &lt;br /&gt;common thread underlying all of our investment products: &lt;br /&gt;UIn convertiblesU, we insist that our call on potential appreciation be accompanied &lt;br /&gt;by above average resistance to declines. &lt;br /&gt;UIn high yield bondsU, we strive to raise our relative performance by avoiding credit &lt;br /&gt;losses, not by reaching for higher (but more uncertain) yields. &lt;br /&gt;UIn distressed company debtU, we buy only where we believe our cost price is fully &lt;br /&gt;covered by asset values. &lt;br /&gt;There will always be cases and years in which, when all goes right, those who take on &lt;br /&gt;more risk will do better than we do.  In the long run, however, I feel strongly that seeking &lt;br /&gt;relative p&lt;br /&gt;erformance which is just a little bit above average on a consistent basis -- with &lt;br /&gt;protection against poor absolute results in tough times -- will prove more effective than &lt;br /&gt;"swinging for the fences." &lt;br /&gt;October 12, 1990 &lt;br /&gt;1990 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Clients &lt;br /&gt;    From:    Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Trust Company of the West &lt;br /&gt;Re:    First Quarter Performance  &lt;br /&gt;The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the movement of a pendulum&lt;br /&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum "on &lt;br /&gt;average," it actually spends very little of its time there.  Instead, it is almost always &lt;br /&gt;swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc.  But whenever the pendulum is &lt;br /&gt;near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back toward the midpoint sooner or &lt;br /&gt;later.  In fact, it is the movement toward an extreme itself that supplies the energy for the &lt;br /&gt;swing back. &lt;br /&gt;Investment markets make the same pendulum-like swing: &lt;br /&gt;-  between euphoria and depression,&lt;br /&gt;-  between celebrating positive developments&lt;br /&gt;and obsessing over negatives, and thus &lt;br /&gt;-between overpriced and underpriced.&lt;br /&gt;This oscillation is one of the most dependable features of the investment world, and &lt;br /&gt;investor psychology seems to spend much more time at the extremes than it does at a &lt;br /&gt;"happy medium." &lt;br /&gt;In late 1990, the securities markets were at a negative extreme as concerns about the &lt;br /&gt;economy and Iraq produced exaggerated risk aversion and thus drastic under-valuation of &lt;br /&gt;all securities considered to be of less than "gilt-edge" quality.  The subsequent first &lt;br /&gt;quarter swing toward mo&lt;br /&gt;re reasonable valuations imparted to our portfolios some of the &lt;br /&gt;best quarterly performance in our history. &lt;br /&gt;With investors worrying less about default rates and forced selling, our high yield bonds &lt;br /&gt;returned more than at any time since the second quarter of 1980.  The rebirth of interest &lt;br /&gt;in smaller and second-tier stocks produced a quarterly return for our convertibles above &lt;br /&gt;any since the fourth quarter of 1982.  Lastly, suspension of "end-of-the-world" thinking &lt;br /&gt;and an increased willingness to envision possible solutions caused our distressed-debt &lt;br /&gt;Special Credits portfolios to gain even more than either high yield bonds or convertibles. &lt;br /&gt;It would be wonderful to be able to successfully predict the swings of the pendulum and &lt;br /&gt;always move in the appropriate direction, but this is certainly an unrealistic expectation.  &lt;br /&gt;We consider it far more reasonable to try to (1) st&lt;br /&gt;ay alert for occasions when a market &lt;br /&gt;has reached an extreme, (2) adjust our behavior slightly in response and, (3) most &lt;br /&gt;importantly, refuse to fall into line with the herd behavior which renders so many &lt;br /&gt;investors dead wrong at tops and bottoms. &lt;br /&gt;1991 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quarter's swing back from&lt;br /&gt; the negative extreme has been rapid and impressive.  &lt;br /&gt;No one can say whether it came too soon or went too far, and we are cautious that these &lt;br /&gt;dramatic results may have been realized without great improvement in the fundamental &lt;br /&gt;economy.  However, we feel "fair" does a much better job of describing the prices which &lt;br /&gt;resulted than would "excessive."  That is, the pendulum is closer to the midpoint at this &lt;br /&gt;time than to an extreme. &lt;br /&gt;The bargains which were so readily available in the fourth quarter of 1990 are no longer &lt;br /&gt;there to the same extent, and we are not acting as if they were.  And we certainly are not &lt;br /&gt;planning on a continuation of the first quarter's performance. Instead, from today's more &lt;br /&gt;reasonable prices, we consider our three areas to be poised for a continuation of their &lt;br /&gt;"normal" above-average risk-adjusted performance. &lt;br /&gt;April 11, 1991 &lt;br /&gt;1991 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:   Oaktree Clients and Friends  &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re:   How the Game Should Be Played  &lt;br /&gt;One of the questions asked most often in connection with our leaving to form Oaktree -&lt;br /&gt;- perhaps second only to "where'd the name come from?" -- is “why did you do it?"  &lt;br /&gt;The answer is that we concluded we had an opportunity to create our own investment &lt;br /&gt;management firm, all of which would run our way, according to our philosophies, &lt;br /&gt;beliefs and standards.  &lt;br /&gt;But what do we mean when we say "our way?"  &lt;br /&gt;Well, an article about sports in the April 2 New York Times Sunday Magazine provided &lt;br /&gt;an excellent metaphor through which to illustrate the point.  In it, the author wrote of &lt;br /&gt;Babe Ruth that he represented  &lt;br /&gt;. . . The Credo of the Home Run: A man can never be faulted, even if he's &lt;br /&gt;wrong, for the bold, aggressive action in pursuit of victory; a real man &lt;br /&gt;must be willing to strike out, to go down swinging.  &lt;br /&gt;I believe this is the way much of the investment world thinks, but it'sU the opposite of what &lt;br /&gt;we believe in. &lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;  In fact, I wrote a memo in 1990 to take issue with a money manager who &lt;br /&gt;justified his poor recent performance by saying "If you want to be in the top 5% of money &lt;br /&gt;managers, you have to be willing to be in the bottom 5%, too."  &lt;br /&gt;"Our way" is UneverU to tolerate poor performance, and certainly not to consider it an &lt;br /&gt;acceptable side-effect of swinging for the fences.  While we strive to be somewhat above &lt;br /&gt;average each year, our philosophy mandates that we put the greatest emphasis on trying to &lt;br /&gt;avoid losing our clients' money.  &lt;br /&gt;And that brings me to what I feel is a much more appealing sports metaphor, which I &lt;br /&gt;clipped from the Wall Street Journal in 1992 but never had occasion to cite until now: the &lt;br /&gt;story of golfer Tom Kite.  The article was about Kite's having won a major tournament, but &lt;br /&gt;the part that interested me dealt with his record up to that time:  &lt;br /&gt;The bespectacled 42-year-old had won ... over the past 20 seasons some $7.2 &lt;br /&gt;million in official prize money, more than any other golfer -- ever.  But [he &lt;br /&gt;had never before won] one of the sport's "majors" (the U.S. and British &lt;br /&gt;Opens, Masters and PGA Championship).  &lt;br /&gt;1995 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the way we think it should be done: by consistently finishing in the money, but &lt;br /&gt;with no need for headline-grabbing victories.  What we think matters isn't whether &lt;br /&gt;you hit a home run or win the Masters on any given day, but rather what your long-&lt;br /&gt;term batting average is.  &lt;br /&gt;Many money managers, it appears, believe either (a) that they really can predict what's &lt;br /&gt;in store for the markets and which issues will do best, or (b) that their clients expect &lt;br /&gt;them to be able to, and to act as if they can.  Thus they swing for the fences each year &lt;br /&gt;with a portfolio which will earn big rewards &lt;br /&gt;if their forecasts are right ... and vice versa.  &lt;br /&gt;The record suggests very few managers truly know what the future will bring, and yet &lt;br /&gt;many keep trying to make money through stock picking and market timing in even the &lt;br /&gt;most efficient markets.  When their holdings appreciate, they recount their insights and &lt;br /&gt;take credit, never admitting when they've been right for unforeseen reasons.  When &lt;br /&gt;they're wrong, they complain about the circumstances that conspired against them and &lt;br /&gt;explain that they were fundamentally right but just off in terms of timing or betrayed by &lt;br /&gt;chance.  Then they go on espousing new predictions without ever publishing a &lt;br /&gt;scorecard from which to judge their record as forecasters.  &lt;br /&gt;Our response on this subject is simple:  &lt;br /&gt;(1) We accept that we're among the many who do not know what the big-picture future&lt;br /&gt;holds.  &lt;br /&gt;(2) It is for this reason that we choose to work in inefficient markets where&lt;br /&gt;specialization, skill and hard work can add value and lead to above-average &lt;br /&gt;performance over time.  &lt;br /&gt;(3) Lastly, we feel that because we're not clairvoyant, it's important to acknowledge our&lt;br /&gt;limitations and&lt;br /&gt;UU put the highest priority on avoiding losses, not executing bold &lt;br /&gt;strategies.  &lt;br /&gt;I was raised on an adage which had good things to say for "he who knows and knows he &lt;br /&gt;knows" but warned about the danger of following "he who knows not but knows not he &lt;br /&gt;knows not.” &lt;br /&gt; Or, as expressed in my favorite quotation, from Stanford behaviorist Amos &lt;br /&gt;Tversky,  &lt;br /&gt;. . . It's frightening to think that you might not know something, but &lt;br /&gt;more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people &lt;br /&gt;who have faith that they know exactly what's going on.  &lt;br /&gt;We never forget how risky it is to join that group.  Thus our "game plan" is directed &lt;br /&gt;at avoiding strikeouts and building a high batting average over time, not at hitting a &lt;br /&gt;home run each trip to the plate.  &lt;br /&gt;May 26, 1995  &lt;br /&gt;1995 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:     Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:  Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re:  bubble.com &lt;br /&gt;The book "Devil Take the Hindmost" by Edward Chancellor does an excellent job of &lt;br /&gt;chronicling the history of financial speculation.  In doing so, it recounts the story of "the &lt;br /&gt;South Sea Bubble" and provides a backdrop against which I'd like to examine some of &lt;br /&gt;the events of today.  &lt;br /&gt;The South Sea Company was for&lt;br /&gt;med in 1711 to help deleverage the British government &lt;br /&gt;by assuming some of the government's debt and paying it off with the proceeds of a &lt;br /&gt;stock offering.  In exchange for performing this service for the Crown, the company &lt;br /&gt;received a monopoly for trading with the Spanish colonies in South America and the &lt;br /&gt;exclusive right to sell slaves there.  Demand for the company's stock was strong due to &lt;br /&gt;the expectation of great profits from these endeavors, although none ever materialized. &lt;br /&gt;In 1720, a speculative mania took flight and the stock soared.  &lt;br /&gt;Sir Isaac Newton, who was the Master of the Mint at the time, joined many other &lt;br /&gt;wealthy Englishmen in investing in the stock.  It rose from £128 in January of l720 to &lt;br /&gt;£1,050 in June.  Early in this rise, however, Newton realized the speculative nature of &lt;br /&gt;the boom and sold his £7,000 worth of stock.  When asked about the direction of the &lt;br /&gt;market, he is reported to have replied “I can calculate the motions of the heavenly &lt;br /&gt;bodies, but not the madness of the people.”  &lt;br /&gt;By September 1720, the bubble was punctured and the stock price fell below £200, off &lt;br /&gt;80% from its high three months earlier.  It turned out, however, that despite having seen &lt;br /&gt;through the bubble earlier, Sir Isaac, like so many investors over the years, couldn't &lt;br /&gt;stand the pressure of seeing those around him make vast profits.  He bought back the &lt;br /&gt;stock at its high and ended up losing £20,000.  Not even one of the world's smartest &lt;br /&gt;men was immune to this tangible lesson in gravity!  &lt;br /&gt;*  *  *&lt;br /&gt;It's obvious from “Devil Take the Hindmost” that many elements of speculative &lt;br /&gt;behavior were present during the South Sea Bubble.  I'&lt;br /&gt;ll cite some of its passages below &lt;br /&gt;and point out the parallels to today that I see:  &lt;br /&gt;“The ideology of self-interest had recovered after the battering it received after the &lt;br /&gt;crisis of the mid-1690s ... its thesis [was] that private vices - avarice, prodigality, &lt;br /&gt;pride and luxury - produced public benefits.”  [Sounds like the "greed is good" &lt;br /&gt;rationalization of the 1980s.]  &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of South Sea spawned talk of any number of speculative schemes, &lt;br /&gt;some of which was probably apocryphal.  “The most famous of the legendary &lt;br /&gt;bubble companies was that ‘for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but &lt;br /&gt;no one to know what it is.’”  [I can't understand what it does, but that's okay; just &lt;br /&gt;tell me the name, &lt;br /&gt;II. or maybe the symbol's enough.]  &lt;br /&gt;Despite their lack of profits, companies like South Sea were able to finance their &lt;br /&gt;operations by issuing stock at higher and higher prices.  “The circularity inherent in &lt;br /&gt;the scheme made a rational calculation of the shares' fair value difficult to compute. &lt;br /&gt;Some argued that the higher the shares rose, the more they were actually worth .... &lt;br /&gt;‘Was there ever such a delusion from the beginning of the world ... according to &lt;br /&gt;this Way of Computing, no Person can Purchase at too high a Rate, since his Profit &lt;br /&gt;will increase in Proportion to the Price he gives.’”  [There's no such thing as too &lt;br /&gt;high a price if the concept is right, and the ability to issue stock at rising prices will &lt;br /&gt;lead to profitability.]  &lt;br /&gt;"Adam Anderson, a former cashier of the South Sea Company, later claimed that &lt;br /&gt;many purchasers of shares ... bought knowing that their long-term prospects were &lt;br /&gt;hopeless, since they aimed to get 'rid of them in the crowded alley to others more &lt;br /&gt;credulous than themselves.'" [The greater fool theory is nothing new.]  &lt;br /&gt;“As Edward Ward observed in his poem ‘A South Sea Ballad’:  &lt;br /&gt;Few Men who follow Reason's Rules, &lt;br /&gt;Grow fat with South-Sea Diet,  &lt;br /&gt;Young Rattles and unthinking Fools &lt;br /&gt;Are those that flourish by it.”  &lt;br /&gt;[The profits went to those unrestrained by reason or experience.]  &lt;br /&gt;Robert Digby wrote “The South Sea Company is continually a source of &lt;br /&gt;wonderment. The sole topic of conversation in England revolves around the shares &lt;br /&gt;of the Company, which have produced vast fortunes for many people in such a short &lt;br /&gt;space of time.  Moreover it is to be noted that trade has completely slowed down, &lt;br /&gt;that more than one hundred ships moored along the river Thames are for sale, and &lt;br /&gt;that the owners of capital prefer to speculate on shares than to work at their normal &lt;br /&gt;business.”  [The name of the company was on everyone's lips, the fortunes it created &lt;br /&gt;were front-page news, and the average Joe was willing to give up his day job to &lt;br /&gt;participate ... sound familiar?]  &lt;br /&gt;* * * &lt;br /&gt;I will devote the rest of this memo to what certainly seems to me to be another market &lt;br /&gt;bubble.  Before doing so, however, I must point out a few things: First, as usual, little &lt;br /&gt;that I will write will be original; instead, I hope to add value by pulling together ideas &lt;br /&gt;from a number of sources.  Second, a single word suffices to describe my recent caution &lt;br /&gt;regarding the stock market: wrong.  Nevertheless, I'll admit my negative bias and  &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fact that I have found the bears convincing and the bulls Pollyanna, and then move on &lt;br /&gt;to discuss the effect on the market of technology as we move into a new millennium.  In &lt;br /&gt;short, I find the evidence of an overheated, speculative market in technology, Internet &lt;br /&gt;and telecommunications stocks overwhelming, as are the similarities to past manias.  &lt;br /&gt; Changing the world -- Of course, the entire furor over technology, e-commerce and &lt;br /&gt;telecom stocks stems from the companies' potential to change the world.  I have &lt;br /&gt;absolutely no doubt that these movements are revolutionizing life as we know it, &lt;br /&gt;or that they will leave the world almost unrecognizable from what it was only a &lt;br /&gt;few years ago.  The challenge lies in figuring out who the winners will be, and &lt;br /&gt;what a piece of them is really worth today.  &lt;br /&gt;The graph at the left shows the stock price performance of the &lt;br /&gt;leading company in an industry that was thought capable of &lt;br /&gt;changing the world.  For that reason, the stock followed the &lt;br /&gt;explosive price pattern that has become typical for technological &lt;br /&gt;innovators.  The predictions were correct: the industry did change &lt;br /&gt;the world, and the company was its big winner.  &lt;br /&gt;The industry was radio.  In the 1920s it was expected to change &lt;br /&gt;the world, and it did.  Its ability to communicate without wires &lt;br /&gt;created entertainment in the home, electronic advertising and the &lt;br /&gt;live delivery of events.  The company was RCA, and as the &lt;br /&gt;industry leader its stock rose from $8 in mid-1927 to $114 in &lt;br /&gt;mid-1929.  &lt;br /&gt;While part of the stock's appreciation was due to the market &lt;br /&gt;boom in which it shared, certainly part was also due to an &lt;br /&gt;overvaluation of its potential.  After the onset of the Great Crash, &lt;br /&gt;RCA's stock fell from that high of $114 to $2½ within three &lt;br /&gt;years.  The Depression can be blamed for some of this &lt;br /&gt;decimation, but it is worth noting that even 25 years after the &lt;br /&gt;1929 peak, when the Depression and World War II were well &lt;br /&gt;over and the post-war recovery was underway, RCA's stock had &lt;br /&gt;yet to get back to a third&lt;br /&gt; of its earlier high.  The times, the &lt;br /&gt;industries and the companies are certainly different today, but it &lt;br /&gt;makes one wonder whether investors aren't again overpaying for &lt;br /&gt;the ability to change the world.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Similarly, a recent article in Fortune reported Warren Buffet's observation that &lt;br /&gt;airplanes and automobiles had been expected to change the world and did ... and &lt;br /&gt;almost all of the manufacturers of both are now gone.  Few things have had the &lt;br /&gt;impact on the world that aviation did, but from its founding through 1992, the &lt;br /&gt;cumulative profit of the airline industry was zero!  &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Buffet puts it as succinctly as anyone could: “The key to investing is not &lt;br /&gt;assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will &lt;br /&gt;grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company &lt;br /&gt;and, above all, the durability of that advantage.  The products or services that have &lt;br /&gt;wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.”  &lt;br /&gt;(Emphasis added) (Three years ago, everyone wanted to be Warren Buffet, or at least &lt;br /&gt;read books about him.  Now, appearing to have missed out on the technology &lt;br /&gt;movement, he and his investment approach are dismissed as passe by the dot-com &lt;br /&gt;gang.)  &lt;br /&gt; Altered lives&lt;br /&gt; -- During the South Sea bubble, as described above, boats were put up &lt;br /&gt;for sale and people with capital shifted from being workers to being investors.  In a &lt;br /&gt;striking parallel, the Internet-commerce revolution is also changing lives.  Of course, &lt;br /&gt;we know that thousands of Americans have become on-line traders either full- or &lt;br /&gt;part-time.  Articles describe people who are trying to "ride the trend" of hot stocks &lt;br /&gt;and benefit from their momentum, but there's little indication that they have any idea &lt;br /&gt;what makes companies do well or stocks go up (or even what some of their &lt;br /&gt;companies do).  The Wall Street Journal of December 7 cited an individual who has &lt;br /&gt;spent his full time in the prior five months trading the stock of one company, CMGI, &lt;br /&gt;which invests in Internet ventures; he doesn't know the CEO's name.  &lt;br /&gt;Also striking is the effect this is having on business education and young careers.  A &lt;br /&gt;front-page article in the New York Times of November 28 reported that applications &lt;br /&gt;at many business schools were flat or down, the number of Americans taking the &lt;br /&gt;GMAT exam was down sharply, and not-insignificant numbers of MBA students &lt;br /&gt;were dropping out after the first year to join the hot fields.  As a professor of &lt;br /&gt;entrepreneurship told me, all of the e-commerce claims will be staked out in the next &lt;br /&gt;year or two; students can't risk staying in school and seeing someone else act on their &lt;br /&gt;ideas.  Five years ago, the hot area for new MBAs was investment banking.  Now, I &lt;br /&gt;hear, investment banks can't get the top students to sign up for interviews and are &lt;br /&gt;having trouble meeting their recruiting goals.  &lt;br /&gt;The pressure to move toward the high-change areas is great, and people are &lt;br /&gt;succumbing.  Everyone in the investment profession knows (or knows of) somebody &lt;br /&gt;who has made hundreds of millions (or a billion) this year on a dot-com investment.  &lt;br /&gt;One can imagine that this makes the buyout specialists who built fortunes over a &lt;br /&gt;lifetime feel like underachievers.  Private equity firms are getting involved in &lt;br /&gt;companies at earlier stages, and with the dot-coms.  On November 30, a Wall Street &lt;br /&gt;Journal article about defections of buyout specialists to venture capital firms cited a &lt;br /&gt;KKR partner who had resigned to do just that.  &lt;br /&gt;Venture capitalists and technologists, in turn, are moving to Internet firms.  As a sign &lt;br /&gt;that it's even becoming hard for more mature technology firms to hold onto people, &lt;br /&gt;the CFO of Microsoft recently quit to join a fiber-optic company.  Remember, &lt;br /&gt;Microsoft has already been public 17 years; the gold-rush is over at the established &lt;br /&gt;firms, and the overnight fortunes have been made.  Even investment bankers are in &lt;br /&gt;transit; on December 14, a New York Times article on the subject was headlined &lt;br /&gt;“Wall St. Is Flush With Cash But Also Green With Envy.”  A Harvard Business &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School professor aptly mixes his metaphors, likening the rush of executives to &lt;br /&gt;Internet-related ventures to “a tsunami of people chasing a pot of gold.”  &lt;br /&gt; The lure of venture capital - I recently presented the case for distressed debt to three &lt;br /&gt;classes in entrepreneurial finance at the University of Chicago Graduate Business School.  &lt;br /&gt;The response of half the students was simple: Why settle for 20-25% per year when you &lt;br /&gt;can make 100% in venture capital?  &lt;br /&gt;Just as venture capital is attracting young businesspeople, it is also turning heads in the &lt;br /&gt;investment community.  One university treasurer told me his school's $29,000 &lt;br /&gt;investment in Yahoo! via a venture fund grew to $54 million (and would be more than &lt;br /&gt;twice that today if it hadn't been sold). Why do anything else, indeed?!  &lt;br /&gt;Before we succumb to this reasoning, however, (and run out to start the OCM Venture &lt;br /&gt;Capital Fund), we should first review the data concerning venture capital's brief &lt;br /&gt;history.  &lt;br /&gt; For funds raised between 1984 and 1989, the median return to Limited Partners &lt;br /&gt;ranged from 7.5% to 15.1%.  For funds raised between 1990 and 1994, it ranged from &lt;br /&gt;20.4% to 29.7%.  These are healthy returns, but certainly the typical v.c. investor &lt;br /&gt;enjoyed no bonanza in that period.  A quarter or more of the funds raised in almost &lt;br /&gt;every year provided returns ranging downward from 10% to negative territory.  &lt;br /&gt; It's only for funds started in the mid-to-late 1990s that the returns have been so eye-&lt;br /&gt;popping.  For each vintage year beginning in 1994, there has been at least one fund &lt;br /&gt;with a return above 200%/year.  And yet, the median returns thus far for vintage years &lt;br /&gt;between 1994 and 1999 range only from zero to 33.7% (although it can be argued that &lt;br /&gt;it's still early).  &lt;br /&gt; While it's hard to settle on a "typical" vintage year for venture capital, 1994 is a &lt;br /&gt;reasonable candidate.  Its funds are five years old, so there has been time to bring &lt;br /&gt;companies to fruition and to market.  And certainly, the environment has been &lt;br /&gt;positive.  In fact, 1994's top fund has returned 235%/year so far, and the average &lt;br /&gt;fund has returned 45%/year, an impressive figure.  But averages can be deceiving, &lt;br /&gt;and this one has certainly been pulled up by the best performers.  The median fund is &lt;br /&gt;up only 22.5%/year.  Half the funds have annual returns below that (by definition), &lt;br /&gt;and the returns in the bottom quartile range from 6.4% to minus 13.2%.  &lt;br /&gt; The recent years all show similar patterns (although it's too early for meaningful &lt;br /&gt;results to be in): phenomenal for the big winners, good on average, but certainly not &lt;br /&gt;universally successful yet.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having reviewed the historic data, what can we say about the future?  Certainly, the &lt;br /&gt;venture capital funds are "where it's at": the toll bridge through which world-changing &lt;br /&gt;companies are likely to pass.  Does that mean they're a good investment today?  &lt;br /&gt;I feel strongly that no investment opportunity is so good that it can't be screwed up by &lt;br /&gt;the wrong relationship between supply and demand.  Too much money for too few &lt;br /&gt;ideas can mean ruinous terms and purchase prices that are too high.  To my mind, the &lt;br /&gt;immediate outlook for venture capital is called into question by:  &lt;br /&gt;- the ardor that has been ignited by recent “headline” returns,  &lt;br /&gt;- thus the huge amount of money looking for a home in ventures,  &lt;br /&gt;- the expanded amounts that v.c. firms are accepting in their new funds,  &lt;br /&gt;- the strengthened negotiating position of entrepreneurs relative to venture capitalists,  &lt;br /&gt;- thus the need among v.c. firms to compete in haste to make investments,  &lt;br /&gt;- the ease with which junior members can leave v.c. firms to start their own funds,  &lt;br /&gt;- the strengthened negotiating position of venture capitalists relative to their investors, and  &lt;br /&gt;- thus the ability of v.c. firms to raise their incentive fee percentage.  &lt;br /&gt;In my experience, the big, low-risk profits have usually come from investments &lt;br /&gt;made at those times when recent results have been poor, capital is scarce, &lt;br /&gt;investors are reticent and everyone says “no way!”  Today, great results in venture &lt;br /&gt;capital are in the headlines, money is everywhere, investors are emboldened and &lt;br /&gt;the mantra is “of course!”  &lt;br /&gt;In this context, it's very much worth noting that in 1994, someone looking at venture &lt;br /&gt;funds formed from 1981 to 1992 would have seen only one vintage year with an average &lt;br /&gt;net return above 12%, and nine out of twelve years with single digit average returns.  &lt;br /&gt;Despite the lukewarm results as of that date, a few forward-looking investors were &lt;br /&gt;willing to commit $7.8 billion to venture capital funds, and it is they who are earning the &lt;br /&gt;returns we see.  In 1998, on the other hand, the 200%+ results on the top funds formed in &lt;br /&gt;recent years egged investors on to commit more than three times that amount: $26.1 &lt;br /&gt;billion.  Today one hears only that investors want to put more into venture capital but &lt;br /&gt;can't get access to the most desirable funds.  I'll leave it to you to deduce the implications &lt;br /&gt;for future returns.  &lt;br /&gt; The role of the IPO: A “mania-within-a-mania” has taken flight in the high-tech &lt;br /&gt;investment world, and it surrounds Initial Public Offerings.  In years past, new &lt;br /&gt;issues had to be priced to sell, and companies accessing the public equity market for &lt;br /&gt;the first time had to hope they could get investors to pay a fair price.  Now, investors &lt;br /&gt;are sure that buying stock on a new issue - at the price the founders are willing to &lt;br /&gt;sell at - is the ticket to easy money. And to date it has been.  &lt;br /&gt;It is reported that the average new issue of 1999, which on average is probably about six &lt;br /&gt;months old, is selling roughly 160% above its issue price (for four times the average gain &lt;br /&gt;in the next-best year).  For an example, The Wall Street Journal of December 8 described &lt;br /&gt;the case of Akamai, which went public on October 29 at a price of $26.  It closed that day &lt;br /&gt;at $145, for an equity market value of $13 billion.  “Fourteen months earlier, ... it could &lt;br /&gt;never have gotten such a reception,” The Journal added.  “It didn't exist.”  Akamai's price &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is $328 today, bringing its market capitalization to $29 billion.  (By the way, in the first &lt;br /&gt;nine months of 1999, Akamai lost $28 million on $1.3 million of sales.)  &lt;br /&gt;The ability to participate in IPOs has become a major perk.  Investment banks compete &lt;br /&gt;with other money managers by promising wealthy individuals allocations in their IPOs.  &lt;br /&gt;Technology companies allocate IPO shares to their customers as a way to cement &lt;br /&gt;business relationships.  &lt;br /&gt;As usual, I don't think investors are thinking this through.  The Akamai IPO was priced at &lt;br /&gt;18% of the first day's closing price.  So either (a) the founding entrepreneurs and &lt;br /&gt;investors sold it 82% below its fair price (and who would know better than they would?) &lt;br /&gt;or (b) the market's wrong.  It may well be that issuers intentionally underprice their &lt;br /&gt;offerings so that the first day's rise will create the "buzz" that will enable (1) the &lt;br /&gt;companies to finance their losses and their expansion through additional stock issuance &lt;br /&gt;and (2) the founders to sell their remaining shares.  I'm sure some of that is at work here, &lt;br /&gt;but how much?  If the closing price of $145 was "right," Akamai left almost $1 billion on &lt;br /&gt;the table in the IPO by selling eight million shares at $26.  &lt;br /&gt;Further, how much due diligence is being done on each new issue?  How experienced are &lt;br /&gt;the people doing it?  How strict are the valuation parameters they're using?  How will the &lt;br /&gt;post-deal prices hold up when the lock-up periods end and the founding entrepreneurs &lt;br /&gt;and venture capitalists start selling the 80-90% of the stock that they still own?  And what &lt;br /&gt;will happen when the options used to attract employees - and to pay service providers - &lt;br /&gt;begin to be exercised and the shares sold?  What price will supply/demand dictate when &lt;br /&gt;the supply of stock increases five or ten times?  &lt;br /&gt;Today, it seems companies are formed and start-up financing is raised not through &lt;br /&gt;discussions of the companies' profit potential, but with reference to the possible timing &lt;br /&gt;and pricing of an IPO.  The recent book "The New, New Thing" by Michael Lewis, about &lt;br /&gt;the career of venture capitalist Jim Clark (Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon), makes &lt;br /&gt;it clear that in many cases, today's entrepreneur isn't thinking idea/startup/company as &lt;br /&gt;might have been the case in the past; rather, it's idea/startup/IPO.  Cashing in used to be &lt;br /&gt;the result of successful company-building. Now it's often the end in itself.  It's the IPO &lt;br /&gt;that's “the thing.”  &lt;br /&gt; How will the companies make money? -- Many of the new firms have great ideas for &lt;br /&gt;making money, but it's appropriate to wonder whether they'll work, how the competition &lt;br /&gt;in each “space” (that's the dot-com term for a business niche) will develop, whether &lt;br /&gt;profits will materialize, and whether they'll be sufficient to justify today's stock prices.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don't think anyone would disagree that it's one thing to innovate and change the world &lt;br /&gt;and another thing entirely to make money.  Business will be different in the future, &lt;br /&gt;meaning that not all of the old rules will hold.  On the other hand, profits come from &lt;br /&gt;taking in more in revenue than you payout in expense, and I don't think that's going to &lt;br /&gt;change.  I'll highlight below just three of the areas in which I have questions about &lt;br /&gt;profitability.  &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, will the Internet and dot-com companies be able to charge enough for their &lt;br /&gt;products to make money?  Front page articles in The New York Times (October 14) and &lt;br /&gt;The Wall Street Journal (July 28) discussed the fact that many of the Internet's offerings &lt;br /&gt;are free.  Decades ago, merchants discovered that they could sell more if they cut prices.  &lt;br /&gt;The Internet firms have taken that one step further: they can move even more &lt;br /&gt;merchandise if they give it away.  As the CEO of Egreetings Network says, “Charging &lt;br /&gt;for [greeting] cards was a small idea.  Giving them away is a really big idea.”  Says a &lt;br /&gt;venture capitalist, “.... it's a fact of life on the Internet: People expect a lot of things for &lt;br /&gt;free.  And if you don't give it away, some other start-up will.” &lt;br /&gt;Internet firms are giving away faxes, long-distance phone calls, music, web browsers &lt;br /&gt;and even Internet service itself.  "The marginal cost of adding another user is practically &lt;br /&gt;zero," says one venture capitalist.  The trouble as I see it is that the marginal revenue is &lt;br /&gt;exactly zero.  Obviously, these firms are giving their services away in order to build &lt;br /&gt;traffic, tie up market share early and/or sell advertising space.  It's far from clear that &lt;br /&gt;profits will follow.  &lt;br /&gt;As I read the articles mentioned above I was reminded of a great series of jokes my &lt;br /&gt;father told when I was young:  &lt;br /&gt;“I lose money on everything I sell.” &lt;br /&gt;“Then how do you stay in business?” &lt;br /&gt;“I make it up on volume.”  &lt;br /&gt;“I lose money on everything I sell.”  &lt;br /&gt;“Then how do you stay in business?”  &lt;br /&gt;“I'm closed Sundays.”  &lt;br /&gt;“I sell everything at cost.” &lt;br /&gt;“Then how do you stay in business?” &lt;br /&gt;“I buy below cost.”  &lt;br /&gt;The riddle of profitability is very much present in this area.  I'm sure some firms will &lt;br /&gt;solve it - but far from all of them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, how practical are the business models of the dot-com firms?  It seems like &lt;br /&gt;ancient history, but I seem to remember that doing business in cyberspace was going to &lt;br /&gt;eliminate the need for conventional advertising, and “virtual inventories” were expected &lt;br /&gt;to replace brick-and-mortar warehouses filled with merchandise.  Now we read about the &lt;br /&gt;huge sums Amazon.com is spending on warehouses, and media advertising is sold out at &lt;br /&gt;high prices because the Internet firms are bidding for it so aggressively.  EToys will do &lt;br /&gt;business without stores and will just own warehouses, but what is a Toys 'R' Us store &lt;br /&gt;other than a warehouse with the front prettied up?  Webvan Group sell groceries over the &lt;br /&gt;Internet, saving on store costs but providing free delivery.  According to the December &lt;br /&gt;15 Journal, however, “as of Sept. 30, Webvan's average order size was $72 -too small to &lt;br /&gt;absorb the costs of home delivery.  For the first nine months of 1999, in fact, Webvan &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a $95 million loss on revenue of just $4.2 million.” &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, what will be the effect of competition?  It will take time, and there will be big &lt;br /&gt;cannibalization issues, but eventually the incumbents in each area will move to defend &lt;br /&gt;their businesses against the e-commerce firms.  Merrill Lynch bit the bullet and decided &lt;br /&gt;to enable customers to trade on line as a response to E*Trade.  Albertson's and Kroger &lt;br /&gt;have announced that they'll mount experimental home delivery systems rather than let &lt;br /&gt;firms like Webvan have the grocery business.  The December l7 L.A. Times reported that &lt;br /&gt;Toys 'R' Us and Walmart had opened online shopping sites in competition with EToys.  &lt;br /&gt;(EToys' stock is now off 70% from its high three months ago, wiping out $7.1 billion of &lt;br /&gt;market value).  Dot-com companies will get there early, make inroads and drive up costs &lt;br /&gt;for the conventional firms, but they will face determined competition from incumbents &lt;br /&gt;fighting for their lives.  &lt;br /&gt;Even among just the dot-coms, competition is bound to delay and limit profitability.  &lt;br /&gt;Most of today's e-commerce companies can, at best, boast of early entry and leading &lt;br /&gt;market share (the so-called "first-mover advantage").  Rarely is there patent protection, &lt;br /&gt;meaningful product differentiation or other substantial barriers to entry.  The companies &lt;br /&gt;can't count on brand loyalty, because it's all just about low price.  There'll always be &lt;br /&gt;someone waiting in the wings to cut price (perhaps to zero) for market share, and given &lt;br /&gt;the ease of gathering information on the Web, consumers will always be able to &lt;br /&gt;immediately find the lowest price.  Location won't matter, because in cyberspace, &lt;br /&gt;everyone is everywhere.  I think factors like these are likely to render profitability elusive &lt;br /&gt;and transitory.  &lt;br /&gt; What are the companies worth? - Eventually, this is what it comes down to.  It's not &lt;br /&gt;enough to buy a share in a good idea, or even a good business.  You must buy it at a &lt;br /&gt;reasonable (or, hopefully, a bargain) price.  &lt;br /&gt;Vast amounts of ink have been devoted to the valuations being put on the new companies.  &lt;br /&gt;For The New York Times's time capsule, David Letterman compiled a list of The Top 10 &lt;br /&gt;Things People in the Year 3000 Should Know About Us.  As a sign of the times, he &lt;br /&gt;included “If you wanted a billion dollars, all you had to do was think of a word and add &lt;br /&gt;dot com.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Priceline.com, which auctions off discount air tickets, (September quarter sales of &lt;br /&gt;$152 million, net loss of $102 million) has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion, &lt;br /&gt;while United and Continental Airlines ($7.1 billion sales, $469 million earnings) are &lt;br /&gt;worth a combined $7.3 billion.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Webvan Group, which started up in business in 1999, had sales of $3.8 million and a &lt;br /&gt;$350,000 profit in the September quarter.  The stock market currently values it at &lt;br /&gt;$7.3 billion.  &lt;br /&gt; On December 9, VA Linux went public at $30 and soared 698% that day to $239, for &lt;br /&gt;a market value of $9.5 billion, half that of Apple.  To that date, the company's 1999 &lt;br /&gt;sales were $17.7 million and it had lost $14.5 million (versus Apple's profit of $600 &lt;br /&gt;million in the most recent twelve months). (VA Linux broke the record for an &lt;br /&gt;opening day rise.  It had been held since November 1998 by theglobe.com, whose &lt;br /&gt;stock rose 606% on the first day, from $4½ to almost $32. Now it's at $8.)  &lt;br /&gt;Among non-Internet tech com p    anies, Yahoo! is worth $119 billion, more than General &lt;br /&gt;Motors and Ford together.  At the current stock price of $432, its p/e ratio on 1999 &lt;br /&gt;estimated earnings is just over 1,000.  America Online trades at alm&lt;br /&gt;ost 250 times &lt;br /&gt;projected earnings for the June year currently underway, and Cisco trades above 100 &lt;br /&gt;tim&lt;br /&gt;es.  Charles Schwab, the apparent winner among brokers in the new era, trades at 54 &lt;br /&gt;tim&lt;br /&gt;es estimated 1999 earnings, triple the multiple for Goldm&lt;br /&gt;an Sachs.  According to &lt;br /&gt;Barron's, the price/earnings ratio of the Nasdaq crossed 170 in November and may have &lt;br /&gt;reached 200 at year-end ... and that's the average.  &lt;br /&gt;An analysis by Sanford Bernstein shows that on Septem&lt;br /&gt;ber 30, you could have bought &lt;br /&gt;America Online and Microsoft for $625 billion and gotten $25 billion of sales and $7 &lt;br /&gt;billion of earnings.  Alternatively, for $635 billion you could have bought 70 industrial, &lt;br /&gt;financial, transportation and utility companies including Bank of America, Chubb, &lt;br /&gt;Federated Department Stores, Litton, Philip Morris, Ryder and Whirlpool and gotten &lt;br /&gt;$747 billion of sales and $43 billion of earnings.  The future certainly looks better for &lt;br /&gt;AOL and Microsoft than for those other companies, but does the differential warrant a &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;/e ratio 6 times as high (89 versus 15)?  &lt;br /&gt;And that's for “established” companies.  Because the price/earnings ratios of Internet &lt;br /&gt;companies are so outlandish - usually negative - one may be forced to look to the &lt;br /&gt;price/sales ratio in order to speak about valuation.  Red Hat, for example, sells at about &lt;br /&gt;1,000 times its annualized revenues in the August quarter.  Many of the Internet and &lt;br /&gt;tech companies are just concepts, and their stocks have truly slipped the valuation &lt;br /&gt;moorings.  &lt;br /&gt;Under these unusual circumstances, The &lt;br /&gt;Journal wrote on December 10, “stock &lt;br /&gt;valuations take on an unusually large importance in gauging a business's performance.” &lt;br /&gt;In o ther words, in the absence of other signs, people must look to the share price for an &lt;br /&gt;indication of how the company is doing.  Isn't th at backwards?  In the old days, investors &lt;br /&gt;figured out how the business was doing and then set th&lt;br /&gt;e share price.  &lt;br /&gt;In this valuation parameter vacuum, a “lottery ticket me&lt;br /&gt;ntality” seems to govern the &lt;br /&gt;purchase decision.  The model for investments in the tech and dot-com companies isn't &lt;br /&gt;the likelihood of a 20% or 30% annual return based on projected earnings and p/e ratios, &lt;br /&gt;but a shot at a 1,000% gain based on a concept.  The pitch might be “We're looking for &lt;br /&gt;first-round financing&lt;br /&gt; for a company valued at $30 million that we think we can IPO in &lt;br /&gt;two years at $2 billion.”  Or maybe it's “The IPO will be priced at $20.  It may end the &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day at $100 and be at $200 in six months.”  Would you play?  Could you stand the risk &lt;br /&gt;of saying no and being wrong?  The pressure to buy can be immense.  &lt;br /&gt;There have always been ideas, stocks and IPOs that produced great profits.  Yet the &lt;br /&gt;pressure to participate wasn't as great as it is today because in the past the winners made &lt;br /&gt;millions, not billions, and it took years, not months.  The upside in the deals that've &lt;br /&gt;worked so far has been 100-to-l (give or take a zero).  With that kind of potential, (a) the &lt;br /&gt;upside becomes irresistible and (b) it doesn't take a very high probability of success to &lt;br /&gt;justify the investment.  I have said in the past that while the market is usually driven by &lt;br /&gt;fear and greed, sometimes the strongest motivator is the fear of missing out.  Never was &lt;br /&gt;that as true as today.  This only intensifies the pressure to join in and crawl further out on &lt;br /&gt;that limb of risk.  &lt;br /&gt;With broader relevance than just the dot-com stocks, the relative performance chart &lt;br /&gt;below from Barron's of September 27 (already quite outdated) shows two things:  &lt;br /&gt;1. over the last two decades, technology stocks have had periods of both &lt;br /&gt;underperformance and overperformance relative to the large-cap universe, and  &lt;br /&gt;2. the recent outperformance is unparalleled even in this bullish period.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing in this chart suggests that it'll be easy money in technology from here.  As &lt;br /&gt;Alan Abelson wrote when he ran the graph, “Our reservation here is that (a) &lt;br /&gt;technology, like everything else in life, is cyclical; and (b) there's something goofy &lt;br /&gt;about the price of a stock discounting as much as a century of earnings for a &lt;br /&gt;company in a field where change is the only constant and where the pace of &lt;br /&gt;change is constantly quickening.” (Emphasis added)  &lt;br /&gt;In September Steve Ballmer, President of Microsoft, said he thought tech stocks were &lt;br /&gt;overvalued.  The stocks are much higher today, and his own is up more than 20%.  &lt;br /&gt;Whose opinion matters?  Is there a price that's too high?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barton Biggs, Chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Asset Management, is a well-&lt;br /&gt;respected observer who has been somewhat cautionary to date (and wrong).  His &lt;br /&gt;November 29 strategy piece was without equivocation.  I'll let him sum up.  &lt;br /&gt;The technology, Internet and telecommunication craze has gone parabolic in &lt;br /&gt;what is one of the great, if not the greatest, manias of all time ... The history of &lt;br /&gt;manias is that they have almost always been solidly based on revolutionary &lt;br /&gt;developments that eventually change the world.  Without fail, the bubble stage of &lt;br /&gt;these crazes ends in tears and massive wealth destruction ... Many of the &lt;br /&gt;professional investors involved in these areas know that what is going on today is &lt;br /&gt;madness.  However, they argue that the right tactic is to stay invested as long as the &lt;br /&gt;price momentum is up.  When momentum begins to ebb, they will sell their &lt;br /&gt;positions and escape the carnage.  Since they have very large positions and since &lt;br /&gt;they all follow the same momentum, I suspect they are deluded in thinking they &lt;br /&gt;will be able to get out in time, because all other momentum investors will be doing &lt;br /&gt;the same thing. (Emphasis added)  &lt;br /&gt;* * *  &lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that a few essential lessons are involved here.  &lt;br /&gt;1.  The positives behind stocks can be genuine and still produce losses if you overpay for &lt;br /&gt;them.  &lt;br /&gt;2. Those positives - and the massive profits that seemingly everyone else is enjoying &lt;br /&gt;- can eventually cause those who have resisted participating to capitulate.  &lt;br /&gt;3. A “top” in a stock, group or market occurs when the last holdout who will become a &lt;br /&gt;buyer does so.  The timing is often unrelated to fundamental developments.  &lt;br /&gt;4. “Prices are too high” is far from synonymous with “the next move will be &lt;br /&gt;downward.”  Things can be overpriced and stay that way for a long time ... or &lt;br /&gt;become far more so.  &lt;br /&gt;5. Eventually, though, valuation has to matter.  &lt;br /&gt;To say technology, Internet and telecommunications stocks are too high and about to &lt;br /&gt;decline is comparable today to standing in front of a freight train.  To say they have &lt;br /&gt;benefited from a boom of colossal proportions and should be examined very skeptically is &lt;br /&gt;something I feel I owe you.  &lt;br /&gt;January 2, 2000  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.s.: The apocalyptic view of the current situation states that the world economy is &lt;br /&gt;dependent on the prosperity of the United States; the prosperity of the United States is &lt;br /&gt;based on the health of its stock market; the performance of the stock market is being &lt;br /&gt;driven by gains in a relatively small number of tech, Internet and telecommunications &lt;br /&gt;stocks; and therefore, when the inevitable correction comes in those few stocks, the &lt;br /&gt;ramifications will be worldwide.  No one knows the extent to which this hypothesis &lt;br /&gt;will be proved correct.  The column below, from The New York Times of January 1, &lt;br /&gt;2000, presents a more benign and enjoyable view.  &lt;br /&gt;2000 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: What's It All About, Alpha? &lt;br /&gt;With apologies to Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick, whose 1966 rendition for the &lt;br /&gt;movie "Alfie" was much more artistic, I couldn't resist adapting their title for a memo on &lt;br /&gt;investment theory. &lt;br /&gt;What's it all about, indeed? Everyone talks about alpha . . . and beta, risk and return, and &lt;br /&gt;efficiency and inefficiency.  But I believe few people use them to mean the same thing, or &lt;br /&gt;correctly.  Thus the thinking I did about alpha wh&lt;br /&gt;ile writing "Safety First" in April has &lt;br /&gt;convinced me to set out my views on all of these subjects. &lt;br /&gt;In this connection, my 1967-69 attendance at the University of Chicago Graduate School &lt;br /&gt;of Business was pivotal.  I had previously been at a non-theoretical Wharton, where I &lt;br /&gt;learned investment practice à la Graham and Dodd but not one word on what I'm about to &lt;br /&gt;discuss.  At Chicago I found a new theory of investm&lt;br /&gt;ents that would revolutionize the &lt;br /&gt;field.  My exposure to it was eye-opening and kept me from becoming an unquestioning &lt;br /&gt;member of what I call the "I know" school of investing (where people think a little effort &lt;br /&gt;is all it takes to know the future direction of any stock or market).  The 32 years since &lt;br /&gt;Chicago have given me enough time to forget a lot of the theory I learned . . . but also, &lt;br /&gt;most importantly, the real-world experience needed to leaven it, leading to my own &lt;br /&gt;synthesis of theory and practice. &lt;br /&gt;UMarket efficiencyU – A great deal of how one views the investment world depends on &lt;br /&gt;one's position on the subject of market efficiency.  Rather than reinvent my own wheel, &lt;br /&gt;I'll lift parts of my memo "Irrational Exuberance" from May 2000.  (Thankfully, when &lt;br /&gt;you copy from yourself it's not plagiarism.) &lt;br /&gt;First, I'll provide my take on the efficient marketeers' view.  Then, I'll describe my own &lt;br /&gt;version of market efficiency.  I'll admit again that academicians don't share my view and &lt;br /&gt;theory says I'm wrong.  But my approach works for me, and I'll restate it below. &lt;br /&gt;While at Chicago, one of the first things I studied was the Efficient Market Hypothesis, &lt;br /&gt;which states: &lt;br /&gt;There are many participants in the markets, and they share roughly equal access to all&lt;br /&gt;relevant information.  They are intelligent, highly motivated and hard working.  Their&lt;br /&gt;analytical models are widely known and employed.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the collective efforts of these participants, information is ref&lt;br /&gt;lected fully&lt;br /&gt;and immediately in the market price of each asset.&lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thus, market prices provide accurate estimates of assets' intrinsic value, and no &lt;br /&gt;participant can consistently identify and profit from instances when they are wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Assets therefore sell at prices from which they can be expected to deliver risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted returns that are "fair" relative to other assets.  Riskier assets must offer higher &lt;br /&gt;returns in order to attract buyers.  The market will set prices so that appears to be the &lt;br /&gt;case, but it won't provide a "free lunch."  That is, there will be no incremental return &lt;br /&gt;that is not related to (and compensatory for) incremental risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believe strongly that some markets are quite efficient, including those for the world's &lt;br /&gt;leading stocks and bonds.  Take international fixed income, for instance.  Here, people try &lt;br /&gt;to decide whether British, French or German government bonds are the cheapest at a &lt;br /&gt;given time and establish portfolio weightings accordingly.  The primary differences &lt;br /&gt;between these bonds, it seems to me, relate to their issuing countries' rates of economic &lt;br /&gt;growth and inflation.  But it's to make allowance for those differences that there exist &lt;br /&gt;differential interest rates and floating exchange rates.  And aren't those some of the &lt;br /&gt;world's most closely watched phenomena, with hundreds of sophisticated financial &lt;br /&gt;institutions on both sides of every question?  Can any one participant realistically expect &lt;br /&gt;to be able to do a superior job in such a market? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stocks are less homogenous, and there's more to choose between them, but I still think the &lt;br /&gt;market for popular stocks is efficient.  That's the reason why, when I left equity research &lt;br /&gt;in 1978, I told Citibank I would "do anything other than spend the rest of my life &lt;br /&gt;choosing between Merck and Lilly."  I believed in efficient markets then, and I believe in &lt;br /&gt;them now. But what do I mean? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I say efficient, I mean it in the sense of "speedy," not "right."  I agree that because &lt;br /&gt;investors work hard to evaluate every new piece of information, asset prices immediately &lt;br /&gt;reflect the consensus view of the information's significance.  I do not, however, believe &lt;br /&gt;the consensus view is necessarily correct.  In January 2000, Yahoo! sold at $237.  In &lt;br /&gt;April 2001 it was at $11.  Anyone who argues that the market was right both times has his &lt;br /&gt;head in the clouds; it has to have been wrong on at least one of those occasions.  But that &lt;br /&gt;doesn't mean many investors were able to detect and act on the market's error. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If prices in efficient markets already reflect the consensus, then sharing the consensus &lt;br /&gt;view will make you likely to earn just an average return.  To beat the market you must &lt;br /&gt;hold an idiosyncratic, or non-consensus, view.  But because the consensus view is as &lt;br /&gt;close to right as most people can get, a non-consensus view is unlikely to make you more &lt;br /&gt;right than the market (and thus to help you beat the market). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that, although the more efficient markets often misvalue &lt;br /&gt;assets, its not easy for anyone person – working with the same information as &lt;br /&gt;everyone else and subject to the same psychological influences – to consistently hold &lt;br /&gt;views that are different from the consensus &lt;br /&gt;UandU closer to being correct.  That's what &lt;br /&gt;makes the mainstream markets awfully hard to beat – even if they aren't always right. &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UInefficiencyU – Although I spent a lot of time last year discussing efficiency, I didn't touch &lt;br /&gt;on inefficiency.  This is a word I've heard misused terribly, usually as a synonym for &lt;br /&gt;"cheap," as in "the oils were fully priced last year but now they're really inefficient."  First &lt;br /&gt;of all, inefficiency doesn't come and go in quick bursts.  Markets are inefficient for &lt;br /&gt;longer-term structural reasons relating primarily to shortcomings on the part of their &lt;br /&gt;participants and infrastructure.  Second, "inefficient" absolutely does not mean "cheap" &lt;br /&gt;(or "dear"). &lt;br /&gt;To me, an inefficient market is one that is marked by at least one (and probably, as a &lt;br /&gt;result, by all) of the following characteristics: &lt;br /&gt; UMarket prices are often wrongU.  Because access to information and the analysis &lt;br /&gt;thereof is highly imperfect, market prices are often far above or far below intrinsic &lt;br /&gt;values. &lt;br /&gt; UThe risk-adjusted return on one asset class can be far out of line with othersU.  Because &lt;br /&gt;assets are often valued at other-than-fair prices, an asset class can deliver a risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted return that is significantly too high (a free lunch) or too low relative to other &lt;br /&gt;asset classes. &lt;br /&gt; USome investors can consistently outperform othersU.  Because of the existence of (a) &lt;br /&gt;significant misvaluations and (b) differences between participants in terms of skill, &lt;br /&gt;insight and information access, it is possible for misvaluations to be identified and &lt;br /&gt;profited from with regularity. &lt;br /&gt;This last point is very important in terms of what it does and does not mean.  Inefficient &lt;br /&gt;markets do not necessarily give their participants generous returns.  Rather, it's my &lt;br /&gt;view    that they provide the raw material – mispricings – that can allow some people &lt;br /&gt;to win a&lt;br /&gt;nd others to lose    on the basis of differential skill.  If prices can be very wrong, &lt;br /&gt;U U&lt;br /&gt;that means it's possible to find bargains or overpay.  For every person who gets a good &lt;br /&gt;buy in an inefficient market, someone else sells too cheap.  One of the great sayings about &lt;br /&gt;poker is that, "In every game there's a fish.  If you've played for 45 minutes and haven't &lt;br /&gt;figured out who the fish is, then it's you."  The same is certainly true of inefficient market &lt;br /&gt;investing. &lt;br /&gt;In inefficient m&lt;br /&gt;arkets, then, it's essential that a manager have superior personal skill, or &lt;br /&gt;"alpha" (see below).  It's actually far more important than in e&lt;br /&gt;fficient markets, where &lt;br /&gt;prices are so well aligned that it's hard to perform far off the average.  Good evidence on &lt;br /&gt;this subject is found in the table on the next page, from "Pioneering Portfolio &lt;br /&gt;Management" by David Swenson of Yale. &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;

This supports the belief that in inefficient markets, either (a) prices diverge more &lt;br /&gt;from intrinsic values, (b) there's more variation among investors in terms of skill, (c) that &lt;br /&gt;variation has more impact, or (d) all of the above.  Any way you slice it, hiring a superior &lt;br /&gt;manager is more crucial in the inefficient markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UReturnU – The terms alpha and beta are derived from the basic form of an algebraic &lt;br /&gt;equation, which is: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;y = a + bx &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus in investments we say a portfolio's result can be predicted by the equation: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;return = alpha + (beta x the market's return) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beta is a coefficient equal to the proportion of the market's return that the portfolio can be &lt;br /&gt;expected to capture.  It can best be described as "degree of responsiveness" to the market, &lt;br /&gt;or "relative volatility."  An S&amp;P index fund will have a beta of 1.0 relative to the S&amp;P &lt;br /&gt;500 (that is, it will go up and down at the same rate as the S&amp;P).  An S&amp;P index fund &lt;br /&gt;leveraged two to one would have a beta of 2.0 (i.e., it will have twice the response).  A &lt;br /&gt;portfolio consisting of half S&amp;P index fund and half cash will have a beta of .5.  A &lt;br /&gt;defensive equity portfolio might be expected to have a beta of .7. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Turning up your beta, whether through the use of leverage or by emphasizing more &lt;br /&gt;volatile holdings, is certainly one way to try to add to your return.  Under investment &lt;br /&gt;theory it's the only way, since "beta x the market's return" is the only non-zero term in the &lt;br /&gt;above equation (more on this later).  The trouble with relying on a high beta to enhance &lt;br /&gt;your return is that it's entirely symmetrical.  It cuts both ways, subtracting as much when &lt;br /&gt;it's wrong as it adds when it's right, which means that it does nothing to increase your &lt;br /&gt;expected return unless the underlying decisions are right.  It epitomizes the Las Vegas &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saying that "the more you bet, the more you win when you win" (but also, as I like to &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;oint out, the more you lose when you lose). &lt;br /&gt;Alpha is a variable equal to the contribution resulting from the skill of the portfolio &lt;br /&gt;manager.  As I wrote in "Safety First," alpha is the ability to profit consistently from &lt;br /&gt;things other than the movements of the market, to add to return without adding &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;roportionately to risk, and to be right more often than is called for by chance.  Examples &lt;br /&gt;of its ingredients include superiority in (a) collecting and analyzing information, (b) &lt;br /&gt;discerni&lt;br /&gt;ng which factors are most important in determining future value, and (c) resisting &lt;br /&gt;the market's manic-depressive fluctuations. &lt;br /&gt;Alpha is what's lacking when a market is efficient.  But just as I believe there are some &lt;br /&gt;relatively efficient markets, I'm also sure people with alpha exist, as well as less efficient &lt;br /&gt;markets where it can be put to good use. &lt;br /&gt;It's essential to recogniz&lt;br /&gt;e th at investment skill isn't distributed evenly – that the &lt;br /&gt;investment world isn't democratic or egalitarian.  That's why Peter Vermilye, the &lt;br /&gt;C&lt;br /&gt;itibank boss who steered me toward convertibles and high yield bonds, says only the top &lt;br /&gt;10% of analysts contribute anything.  It's also why I think so little of investment &lt;br /&gt;management firms that describe their edge in terms of head count; an army of average &lt;br /&gt;analysts will do you no good. &lt;br /&gt;That's because, in my view, alpha is best thought of as "differential advantage," or skill &lt;br /&gt;U U&lt;br /&gt;that others don't possess.  Alpha isn't knowing something, &lt;br /&gt;it's knowing something &lt;br /&gt;others don't know.  If everyone else shares a bit of k&lt;br /&gt;nowledge, it provides no advantage.  &lt;br /&gt;It certainly won't help you beat the market, given that the market p&lt;br /&gt;rice embodies the &lt;br /&gt;consensus view of investors – who on average know what you know. &lt;br /&gt;Alpha is entirely personal.  It's idiosyncratic, an art form.  It's superior insight; some &lt;br /&gt;people just "get it" better than others.  Some of them are mechanistic quants; others are &lt;br /&gt;entirely intuitive.  Hard work is a commo&lt;br /&gt;n thread among the best investors I know, but &lt;br /&gt;hard work alone is absolutely insufficient to explain their superior performance. &lt;br /&gt;Alpha is zero for someone with no skill (i.e., a dart thrower).   Warren Buffett, on the &lt;br /&gt;other hand, seems to have lots of alpha – even in a market most people think of as &lt;br /&gt;efficient.  It's possible to have negative alpha if you're wrong more often than not.  &lt;br /&gt;Someone who's always wrong would have lots of negative alpha, but he'd be a great guy &lt;br /&gt;to know (since you could be right all the time by doing the opposite of what he says). &lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows it's a cornerstone of investment theory th&lt;br /&gt;at there's no such thing as &lt;br /&gt;alpha . . .  &lt;br /&gt;Clearly this underlies the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  The market is more right &lt;br /&gt;than any investor.  No investor is better than any other.  No one is capable of &lt;br /&gt;consistently outperforming.  Anecdotal evidence of superior performance is &lt;br /&gt;dismissed by academicians who attribute it to luck or a too-short trial period. &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . but there's something of an oxymoron afoot.  Even though thousands of people &lt;br /&gt;expect to make a living from active investment management, much of traditional &lt;br /&gt;investment thinking is built on the realization that alpha is severely limited (even &lt;br /&gt;though the practitioners don't state it that way). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why do I say that?  Most investors claim they can outperform the market – that is, can &lt;br /&gt;see, assess and understand better than the average investor – because of superior &lt;br /&gt;intelligence and hard work.  Doesn't everyone think he can beat the market?  But much of &lt;br /&gt;what's actually practiced, even by Oaktree, subtly acknowledges that the ability to know &lt;br /&gt;more – and if you think of it, that's a lot of what alpha really is – is quite limited. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's a common assumption that if an investor's portfolios are highly concentrated, they're &lt;br /&gt;risky.  But that assumes he can't see the future.  If he could, it would be perfectly safe to &lt;br /&gt;have a low level of diversification.  In fact, if his foresight were perfect, then the safest &lt;br /&gt;portfolio would hold only one asset, because that's the one he would think of most highly &lt;br /&gt;(and, since he could see the future, he would of course be right).  Thus diversification, &lt;br /&gt;which is widely practiced even in the "I know" school of investing, represents a tacit &lt;br /&gt;acknowledgement that there's a lot that investors don't know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investors' strong preference for liquidity is another indicator that this limitation is &lt;br /&gt;accepted.  Even the "I know" investors, who buy on the assumption they're right, insist on &lt;br /&gt;liquidity – because they know there's a good chance they'll be wrong and need to beat a &lt;br /&gt;retreat.  But the more you can see the future, the less likely you'll be wrong, and the less &lt;br /&gt;risk there is that exiting could be difficult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In reality, then, not just investment theory, but also a great deal of everyday practice, is &lt;br /&gt;built around the acknowledgement that alpha – skill and foresight – is a scarce &lt;br /&gt;commodity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;URiskU – It's essential that investors consider risk.  In the time since I entered the &lt;br /&gt;investment field, return has increasingly come to be evaluated in risk-adjusted terms.  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that if two portfolios return 8% a year for five years, the two managers &lt;br /&gt;didn't necessarily do an equally good job of investing.  If one did it with T-bills and the &lt;br /&gt;other with emerging market stocks, the first manager almost certainly did a better job – &lt;br /&gt;since he earned the same return with far less risk.  That's real added value, just like &lt;br /&gt;earning more return with the same or less risk.  To know how good a job a manager &lt;br /&gt;did, then, you have to have a good idea how much risk he took. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet I think risk may be the area where both theory and many aspects of practice are &lt;br /&gt;furthest from right.  The first thing you learn in investment theory, and one of the most &lt;br /&gt;widely agreed-on assumptions in practice, is that "volatility equals risk."  This premise &lt;br /&gt;underlies a great deal of portfolio theory, asset allocation, portfolio optimization and &lt;br /&gt;performance assessment.  But what are its merits? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the academicians of the 1950s and '60s were influenced to accept volatility as &lt;br /&gt;the measure of investment risk by its two outstanding virtues: it is (a) absolute and (b) &lt;br /&gt;quantifiable.  They can tell you precisely what the standard deviation of a stock or a &lt;br /&gt;portfolio's return was in the past, and thus it only takes a little extrapolation to project &lt;br /&gt;what it's going to be in the future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will suggest some other ways to think about risk, but (a) they will vary from person to &lt;br /&gt;person and from situation to situation, and/or (b) they will not be easily quantified.  Thus &lt;br /&gt;they won't permit you to say that one asset or portfolio would be riskier than another &lt;br /&gt;(other than possibly in a given application).  You won't even be able to say how risky an &lt;br /&gt;asset or portfolio was in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What is risk?  First of all, I don't think risk is synonymous with volatility.  And second, &lt;br /&gt;the indicia of risk vary by asset class. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At Oaktree, when we think about adding an asset to a portfolio, we ask whether the risk &lt;br /&gt;entailed is tolerable (i.e., within our charter from our clients) and offset by the likely &lt;br /&gt;return.  And by risk we mean the chance of losing our clients' money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In high yield bonds we concentrate on the risk of default and how much principal would &lt;br /&gt;likely be unrecoverable.  In distressed debt we wonder whether the company's assets will &lt;br /&gt;turn out to be worth less than we think or the reorganization will go against us.  In &lt;br /&gt;convertibles and emerging market equities we worry about the chance a stock will decline &lt;br /&gt;and the likelihood that our protective efforts will fail to insulate us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We do not think about volatility.  With our capital in either locked-up funds or long-term &lt;br /&gt;relationships, we worry only about whether the ultimate result, perhaps years down the &lt;br /&gt;road, will be positive or negative, and by how much.  We think this is what our clients &lt;br /&gt;pay us to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But we make no claim that this approach to risk is subject to quantification or numerical &lt;br /&gt;manipulation.  Bruce Karsh probably couldn't have quantified the riskiness of Conseco &lt;br /&gt;bonds at the time we bought them last June.  Richard Masson and Matt Barrett probably &lt;br /&gt;wouldn't have agreed with him, or with each other, on the probability of loss.  Any figure &lt;br /&gt;they settled on probably wouldn't have been in a form that could be equated with risk.  &lt;br /&gt;And even today, a year later and after having sold the bonds, we still can't quantify &lt;br /&gt;the risk we took.  It's a concept, a notion, a worry . . . but not a number. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This might be the right way to think about risk – it's certainly how we do it – but it &lt;br /&gt;wouldn't work at all for a "quant."  He'd have no way to state our portfolio's risk, or its &lt;br /&gt;risk-adjusted return, or tell whether our performance was superior or inferior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will an investment lose money?  Will a pension fund fail to earn its actuarial assumption?  &lt;br /&gt;Will an endowment be unable to cover its spending rate?  Will a retiree have less than he &lt;br /&gt;needs to live on?  Will a manager lose an account?  These are the risks – the perils – that &lt;br /&gt;we think matter.  &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most pension funds have a very long time horizon, and for a university endowment it's &lt;br /&gt;theoretically infinite.  Volatile quarterly returns wouldn't be a meaningful source of risk &lt;br /&gt;for them as they would be for a retiree scraping by.  But once you say a given portfolio is &lt;br /&gt;risky for one investor but not another, there ceases to be a unique number that measures &lt;br /&gt;its absolute riskiness.  In that case, how can you talk about its risk, or its risk-adjusted &lt;br /&gt;return? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UCorrelationU – The final analytical element to be considered when assembling securities &lt;br /&gt;into portfolios is their degree of connectedness, or correlation.  As discussed above, a &lt;br /&gt;one-asset portfolio would be optimal for someone who can see the future.  The main &lt;br /&gt;reason for holding more than one asset is diversification.  But the principal virtue of &lt;br /&gt;diversification, protection from catastrophic error, is wiped out if the underlying assets &lt;br /&gt;will react the same to environmental change and move together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus it's not enough to be able to estimate return and risk in isolation; we must &lt;br /&gt;understand correlation.  Even if we can estimate the separate potential of two assets, we &lt;br /&gt;cannot know how a portfolio combining them will behave unless we know how they will &lt;br /&gt;move relative to each other.  Two stocks in the same industry may be highly correlated, &lt;br /&gt;but two companies whose products compete directly may not (that is, whichever one &lt;br /&gt;wins, the other is likely to lose). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let's say there are two assets with high prospective return and risk.  A portfolio consisting &lt;br /&gt;of the two can have high risk if they are correlated but low risk if they are not.  Thus &lt;br /&gt;adding an uncorrelated, high-risk asset can reduce the overall riskiness of a portfolio.  &lt;br /&gt;This understanding revolutionized investing by enabling risk-averse investors to hold &lt;br /&gt;high-return, high-risk assets as long as they are uncorrelated with the rest of their &lt;br /&gt;portfolio.  Certainly Oaktree owes much of its very existence to the understanding of how &lt;br /&gt;assets behave in combination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tracking error, which lately has been of increased interest, refers to a specific type of &lt;br /&gt;connectedness: that between a portfolio and a benchmark.  More and more, clients are &lt;br /&gt;asking about managers' tracking error in the past and monitoring it after hiring them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A client hires managers to play specific roles in its portfolio, and it wants to be sure they &lt;br /&gt;will do so.  In considering whether to include high yield bonds in its portfolio, for &lt;br /&gt;example, the client may model the performance of the portfolio incorporating the &lt;br /&gt;Salomon Cash-Pay Index as a proxy for the high yield bond component.  Then if the &lt;br /&gt;client hires a manager, it wants to be sure the manager will track the Salomon Index &lt;br /&gt;closely (of course while outperforming!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus clients have reason to want low tracking error.  But if you think about it, the two &lt;br /&gt;principal sources of tracking error are (a) over- and under-weightings of the securities in &lt;br /&gt;the index and (b) inclusion of off-index securities.  So it's obviously possible for tracking &lt;br /&gt;error to be too low; an index fund would have zero tracking error, but that's not what &lt;br /&gt;clients hire active managers to create.  Thus we have a client who monitors our tracking &lt;br /&gt;error and complains when it's too low, because they want to see active bets being made. &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*          *          *&lt;br /&gt;This last point illustrates what I think should be the role of theory in our industry.  In &lt;br /&gt;short, I think, theory should inform our decisions but not dominate them. &lt;br /&gt;If we entirely ignore theory, we can make big mistakes.  We can fool ourselves into &lt;br /&gt;thinking it's possible to know more than everyone else and regularly beat heavily &lt;br /&gt;populated markets.  We can buy securities for their returns but ignore their risk.  We can &lt;br /&gt;buy fifty correlated securities and mistakenly think we've diversified.  When I think of the &lt;br /&gt;impact of being blind to theory, I flash back to 1970 and the frighteningly simplistic &lt;br /&gt;rationale behind my colleagues' expectation of 12% a year from stocks: if they could &lt;br /&gt;emulate the historic 10% return with ease through indexing, it should be a snap to add a &lt;br /&gt;couple of percent with just a little effort. &lt;br /&gt;But swallowing theory whole can make us turn the process over to a computer and &lt;br /&gt;miss out on the contribution skillful individuals can make.  The image here is of the &lt;br /&gt;efficient-market-believing finance professor who takes a walk with a student.  "Isn't that a &lt;br /&gt;$10 bill lying on the ground?" asks the student.  "No, it can't be a $10 bill," answers the &lt;br /&gt;professor.  "If it were, someone would have picked it up by now."  The professor walks &lt;br /&gt;away, and the student picks it up and has a beer. &lt;br /&gt;So how do we balance the two?  By applying informed common sense.  At Chicago, I &lt;br /&gt;spent a wonderful seme&lt;br /&gt;ster with Professor James Lorie.  Students loved his anecdote-&lt;br /&gt;filled course, which we nicknamed "Lorie's Stories," and its visits from active investors.  &lt;br /&gt;True-believing theorists may have sneered at it, but it was this class that inspired me to &lt;br /&gt;integrate my practical Wharton foundation and the Chicago theory, rather than stick &lt;br /&gt;exclusively to either one. &lt;br /&gt;A year after graduating, I had lunch with Jim Lorie and asked – off the theoretical record &lt;br /&gt;– how he would manage a portfolio.  His simple advice was informed by theory but&lt;br /&gt;realistic: "I would index the core and manage the hell out of the periphery."&lt;br /&gt;*          *          *&lt;br /&gt;The key turning point in my investment management career came when I&lt;br /&gt; concluded that &lt;br /&gt;hard work and skill would pay off best in inefficient markets.  Theory informed that &lt;br /&gt;decision and prevented me from wasting my time elsewhere, but it took an understanding &lt;br /&gt;of the limits of the theory to keep me from completely accepting the arguments against &lt;br /&gt;active management.  Theory and practice have to be balanced in this way.  Certainly &lt;br /&gt;neither alone is enough. &lt;br /&gt;July 11, 2001 &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the title of this memo I’ve borrowed the tagline from Mass Mutual’s advertising campaign. &lt;br /&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: You Can't Predict. You Can Prepare. &lt;br /&gt;Those who have been readers of my memos for any meaningful period of time know &lt;br /&gt;there are a few things I dismiss and a few I believe in thoroughly.  The form&lt;br /&gt;er include &lt;br /&gt;economic forecasts, which I think don't add value, and the list of the latter starts with &lt;br /&gt;cycles and the need to prepare for them. &lt;br /&gt;"Hey," you might say, "that's contradictory.  The best way to prepare for cycles is to &lt;br /&gt;predict them, and you just said it can't be done."  That's absolutely true, but in my opinion &lt;br /&gt;by no m&lt;br /&gt;eans debilitating.  All of investing consists of dealing with the future, as I've &lt;br /&gt;written before, and the future is something we can't know much about.  But the limits on &lt;br /&gt;our foreknowledge needn't doom us to failure as long as we acknowledge them and act &lt;br /&gt;accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the key to dealing with the future lies in knowing where you are, even if &lt;br /&gt;you can't know precisely where you're going.  Knowing where you are in a cycle and&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;what that implies for the future is very different from predicting the timing, extent &lt;br /&gt;and shape of the next cyclical move.  And so we'd better understand all we can about &lt;br /&gt;cycles and their behavior. &lt;br /&gt;UCycles in General &lt;br /&gt;I think several things about cycles are worth bearing in mind: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UCycles are inevitableU.  Every once in a while, an up-or down-leg goes on for a long &lt;br /&gt;time and/or to a great extreme and people start to say "this time it's different."  They &lt;br /&gt;cite the changes in geopolitics, institutions, technology or behavior that have rendered &lt;br /&gt;the "old rules" obsolete.  They make investment decisions that extrapolate the recent &lt;br /&gt;trend.  And then it turns out that the old rules do still apply, and the cycle resumes.  In &lt;br /&gt;the end, trees don't grow to the sky, and few things go to zero.  Rather, most &lt;br /&gt;phenomena turn out to be cyclical. &lt;br /&gt; UCycles' clout is heightened by the inability of investors to remember the pastU.  As &lt;br /&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith says, "extreme brevity of the financial memory" keeps ma&lt;br /&gt;participants from recognizing the recurring nature of these patterns, and thus their &lt;br /&gt;inevitability: &lt;br /&gt;rket &lt;br /&gt;. . . when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again, sometimes in &lt;br /&gt;only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely &lt;br /&gt;self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;larger economic world.  There can be few fields of human endeavor in which &lt;br /&gt;history counts for so little as in the world of finance.  Past experience, to the &lt;br /&gt;extent that it is part of memo&lt;br /&gt;ry at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those &lt;br /&gt;who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UCycles are self-correctingU, and their reversal is not necessarily dependent on &lt;br /&gt;exogenous events.  The reason they reverse (rather than going on forever) is that &lt;br /&gt;trends create the reasons for their own reversal.  Thus I like to say success carries &lt;br /&gt;within itself the seeds of failure, and failure the seeds of success. &lt;br /&gt;Seen through the lens of human perception, &lt;br /&gt;Ucycles are often viewed as less &lt;br /&gt;symmetrical than they areU.  Negative price fluctuations are called "volatility," while &lt;br /&gt;positive price fluctuations are called "profit."  Collapsing markets are called "selling &lt;br /&gt;panics," while surges receive more benign descriptions (but I think they may best be &lt;br /&gt;seen as "buying panics"; see tech stocks in 1999, for example).  Commentators talk &lt;br /&gt;about "investor capitulation" at the bottom of market cycles, while I also see &lt;br /&gt;capitulation at tops, when previously-prudent investors throw in the towel and buy. &lt;br /&gt;I have views on how these general observations and others apply to specific kinds of &lt;br /&gt;cycles, which I will set forth below. &lt;br /&gt;UThe Economic Cycle &lt;br /&gt;Few things are the subject of more study than the economy.  There's a whole profession &lt;br /&gt;built around doing so.  Academics try to understand the economy, and professionals try to &lt;br /&gt;predict its course.  Personally, I'&lt;br /&gt;d stick to the former.  I think we can gain a good grasp of &lt;br /&gt;how the economy works, but I do not think we can predict its fluctuations. &lt;br /&gt;I have written ad nauseam on this subject, but I will repeat a few of&lt;br /&gt; the observations I &lt;br /&gt;consider relevant: &lt;br /&gt;There are hundreds, or more likely thousands, of people out there trying to predict the&lt;br /&gt;movements of the economy, but no one has a record much better than anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;Certain&lt;br /&gt;ly no one who was consistently capable of accurately predicting the economy's&lt;br /&gt;movements would be among those distributing their forecasts gratis.&lt;br /&gt;The markets already incorporate the views of the consensus of economists, and thus&lt;br /&gt;holding a consensus view can't help you make above-average returns (even if it's&lt;br /&gt;right).&lt;br /&gt;Non-consensus views can make money for you, but to do so they must be right.&lt;br /&gt;Because the consensus re&lt;br /&gt;flects the efforts of a large number of intelligent and&lt;br /&gt;informed people, however, it's usually the closest we can get to right.  In other words,&lt;br /&gt;I doubt there's anyone out there with non-consensus views that are right routinely.&lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Most of the time, the consensus forecast extrapolates current observations.  Most &lt;br /&gt;predictions for growth, inflation and interest rates bear a strong resemblance to the &lt;br /&gt;levels prevailing at the time they're made.  Thus they're close to right when nothing &lt;br /&gt;changes radically, which is the case most of the time, but no prediction can be &lt;br /&gt;counted on to foretell the important sea changes.  And it's in predicting radical &lt;br /&gt;changes that extraordinary profit potential exists.  In other words, it's the &lt;br /&gt;UsurprisesU &lt;br /&gt;that have profound market impact (and thus profound profit potential), but &lt;br /&gt;there's a good reason why they're called surprises: it's hard to see them coming! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Each time there's a radical change, there's an economist who predicted it, and that &lt;br /&gt;person gets to enjoy his fifteen minutes of fame.  Usually, however, he wasn't right &lt;br /&gt;because of a superior ability to see the future, but rather because he tends to hold &lt;br /&gt;extreme positions (or perhaps he's a dart thrower) and this time the phenomenon went &lt;br /&gt;his way.  Rarely if ever is that economist right twice in a row. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So forecasts are unlikely to help us foresee the movements of the economic cycle.  &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, we must be aware that it exists and repeats.  The greatest mistakes with &lt;br /&gt;regard to the economic cycle result from a willingness to believe that it will not recur.  &lt;br /&gt;But it always does – and those gullible enough to believe it won't tend to lose money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we marketed our first distressed debt fund in 1988, most of the resistance came &lt;br /&gt;from people who said, "maybe there won't be a recession, and thus nothing for you to &lt;br /&gt;buy."  Of course, we were deep into a recession within two years, and our 1988-92 &lt;br /&gt;distressed debt funds found lots to buy and produced excellent returns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eminent observers concluded again in the 1990s that the cycle had been eliminated and &lt;br /&gt;there would be no recession.  In 1996, the Wall Street Journal wrote: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From boardrooms to living rooms and from government offices to trading floors, a &lt;br /&gt;new consensus is emerging:  The big, bad business cycle has been tamed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Top business leaders were quoted as saying "There is no natural law that says we have to &lt;br /&gt;have a recession" and "I don't see what could happen to make a cyclical downturn."  &lt;br /&gt;(These quotes are reminiscent of – and look no less silly than – some of my favorites &lt;br /&gt;from 1928: "There will be no interruption of our present prosperity" and "I cannot help &lt;br /&gt;but raise a dissenting voice to the statements that . . . prosperity in this country must &lt;br /&gt;necessarily diminish and recede in the future.") &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those quoted in 1996 might insist they weren't saying there would never be another &lt;br /&gt;recession, but rather that the tendency toward cyclical fluctuation had been dampened and &lt;br /&gt;there wouldn't be a recession soon.  And they might say they were right in 1996, because &lt;br /&gt;there wasn't one until 2001.  If managers had feared a recession in 1996, they might have &lt;br /&gt;pulled in their horns and missed some of the profits of the late 1990s.  But they also might &lt;br /&gt;have avoided over-expanding and participating fully in the recession of 2001. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to recognize that cycles reverse, and to allow for it.  I described in &lt;br /&gt;my last memo, "What Lies Ahead?," the manner in which a recession continues until, at &lt;br /&gt;the margin, a few participants stop cutting back and decide instead to act in anticipation &lt;br /&gt;of better times.  I believe this process, and the reverse process that ev&lt;br /&gt;entually causes &lt;br /&gt;growth to stall out, will go on forever.  No one knows when the turn will occur, or how &lt;br /&gt;far the correcting leg will go, but the odds are against anyone who says, "the business &lt;br /&gt;cycle is dead." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can non-forecasters like Oaktree best cope with the ups and downs of the economic &lt;br /&gt;cycle?  I think the answer lies in knowing where we are and leaning against the wind.  For &lt;br /&gt;example, when the economy has fallen substantially, observers are depressed, capacity &lt;br /&gt;expansion has ceased and there begin to be signs of recovery, we are willing to invest in &lt;br /&gt;companies in cyclical industries.  When growth is strong, capacity is being brought on &lt;br /&gt;stream to keep up with soaring demand and the market forgets these are cyclical &lt;br /&gt;companies whose peak earnings deserve trough valuations, we trim our holdings &lt;br /&gt;aggressively.  We certainly might do so too early, but that beats the heck out of doing it &lt;br /&gt;too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Credit Cycle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The longer I'm involved in investing, the more impressed I am by the power of the &lt;br /&gt;credit cycle.  It takes only a small fluctuation in the economy to produce a large &lt;br /&gt;fluctuation in the availability of credit, with great impact on asset prices and back &lt;br /&gt;on the economy itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The process is simple: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The economy moves into a period of prosperity. &lt;br /&gt; Providers of capital thrive, increasing their capital base. &lt;br /&gt; Because bad news is scarce, the risks entailed in lending and investing seem to have &lt;br /&gt;shrunk. &lt;br /&gt; Risk averseness disappears. &lt;br /&gt; Financial institutions move to expand their businesses – that is, to provide more &lt;br /&gt;capital. &lt;br /&gt; They compete for market share by lowering demanded returns (e.g., cutting interest &lt;br /&gt;rates), lowering credit standards, providing more capital for a given transaction, and &lt;br /&gt;easing covenants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the extreme, providers of capital finance borrowers and projects that aren't worthy of &lt;br /&gt;being financed.  As The Economist said earlier this year, "the worst loans are made at the &lt;br /&gt;best of times."  This leads to capital destruction – that is, to investment of capital in &lt;br /&gt;projects where the cost of capital exceeds the return &lt;br /&gt;UonU capital, and eventually to cases &lt;br /&gt;where there is no return &lt;br /&gt;UofU capital. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this point is reached, the up-leg described above is reversed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Losses cause lenders to become discouraged and shy away. &lt;br /&gt; Risk averseness rises, and along with it, interest rates, credit restrictions and covenant &lt;br /&gt;requirements. &lt;br /&gt; Less capital is made available – and at the trough of the cycle, only to the most &lt;br /&gt;qualified of borrowers. &lt;br /&gt; Companies become starved for capital.  Borrowers are unable to roll over their debts, &lt;br /&gt;leading to defaults and bankruptcies. &lt;br /&gt; This process contributes to and reinforces the economic contraction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, at the extreme the process is ready to be reversed again.  Because the &lt;br /&gt;competition to make loans or investments is low, high returns can be demanded along &lt;br /&gt;with high creditworthiness.  Contrarians who commit capital at this point have a shot at &lt;br /&gt;high returns, and those tempting potential returns begin to draw in capital.  In this way, a &lt;br /&gt;recovery begins to be fueled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I stated earlier that cycles are self-correcting.  The credit cycle corrects itself through the &lt;br /&gt;processes described above, and it represents one of the factors driving the fluctuations of &lt;br /&gt;the economic cycle.  Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise &lt;br /&gt;lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends &lt;br /&gt;prosperity, and on and on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In "Genius Isn't Enough" on the subject of Long-Term Capital Management, I wrote &lt;br /&gt;"Look around the next time there's a crisis; you'll probably find a lender."  &lt;br /&gt;Overpermissive providers of capital frequently aid and abet financial bubbles.  &lt;br /&gt;There have been numerous recent examples where loose credit contributed to booms that &lt;br /&gt;were followed by famous collapses: real estate in 1989-92; emerging markets in 1994-98; &lt;br /&gt;Long-Term Capital in 1998; the movie exhibition industry in 1999-2000; venture capital &lt;br /&gt;funds and telecommunications companies in 2000-01.  In each case, lenders and investors &lt;br /&gt;provided too much cheap money and the result was over-expansion and dramatic losses.  &lt;br /&gt;In "Fields of Dreams" Kevin Costner was told, "if you build it, they will come."  In the &lt;br /&gt;financial world, if you offer cheap money, they will borrow, buy and build – often &lt;br /&gt;without discipline, and with very negative consequences. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The credit cycle contributed tremendously to the tech bubble.  Money from venture &lt;br /&gt;capital funds caused far too many companies to be created, often with little in terms of &lt;br /&gt;business justification or profit prospects.  Wild demand for IPOs caused their hot stocks &lt;br /&gt;to rise meteorically, enabling venture funds to report triple-digit returns and attract still &lt;br /&gt;more capital requiring speedy deployment.  The generosity of the capital markets let &lt;br /&gt;companies sign on for huge capital projects that were only partially financed, secure in &lt;br /&gt;the knowledge that more financing would be available later, at higher p/e's and lower &lt;br /&gt;interest rates as the projects were further along.  This ease caused far more capacity to be &lt;br /&gt;built than was needed, a lot of which is sitting idle.  Much of the investment that went &lt;br /&gt;into it may never be recovered.  Once again, easy money has led to capital destruction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making investments, it has become my habit to worry less about the economic &lt;br /&gt;future – which I'm sure I can't know much about – than I do about the &lt;br /&gt;supply/demand picture relating to capital.  Being positioned to make investments in &lt;br /&gt;an uncrowded arena conveys vast advantages.  Participating in a field that &lt;br /&gt;everyone's throw&lt;br /&gt;ing money at is a formula for disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have lived through a long period in which cash acted like ballast, retarding your &lt;br /&gt;progress.  Now I think we're going into an environment where cash will be king.  If &lt;br /&gt;you went to a leading venture capital fund in 1999 and said, "I'd like to invest $10 million &lt;br /&gt;with you," they'd say, "Lots of people want to give us their cash.  What else can you &lt;br /&gt;offer?  Do you have contacts?  Strategic insights?"  I think the answer today would be &lt;br /&gt;different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the critical elements in business or investment success is staying power.  I often &lt;br /&gt;speak of the six-foot-tall man who drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on &lt;br /&gt;average.  Companies have to be able to get through the tough times, and cash is one of the &lt;br /&gt;things that can make the difference.  Thus all of the investments we're making today &lt;br /&gt;assume we'll be going into the difficult part of the credit cycle, and we're looking for &lt;br /&gt;companies that will be able to stay the course. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Corporate Life Cycle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As indicated above, business firms have to live through ups and downs.  They're organic &lt;br /&gt;entities, and they have life cycles of their own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most companies are born in an entrepreneurial mode, starting with dreams, limited capital &lt;br /&gt;and the need to be frugal.  `Success comes to some.  They enjoy profitability, growth and &lt;br /&gt;expanded resources, but they also must cope with increasing bureaucracy and managerial &lt;br /&gt;challenges.  The lucky few become world-class organizations, but eventually most are &lt;br /&gt;confronted with challenges relating to hubris; extreme size; the difficulty of controlling &lt;br /&gt;far-flung operations; and perhaps ossification and an unwillingness to innovate and take &lt;br /&gt;risks.  Some stagnate in maturity, and some fail under aging products or excessive debt &lt;br /&gt;loads and move into distress and bankruptcy.  The reason I say failure carries within itself &lt;br /&gt;the seeds of success is that bankruptcy then permits some of them to shed debt and &lt;br /&gt;onerous contracts and emerge with a reborn emphasis on frugality and profitability.  And &lt;br /&gt;the cycle resumes . . . as ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The biggest mistakes I have witnessed in my investing career came when people ignored &lt;br /&gt;the limitations imposed by the corporate life cycle.  In short, investors did assume trees &lt;br /&gt;could grow to the sky.  In 1999, just as in 1969, investors accepted that ultra-high profit &lt;br /&gt;growth could go on forever.  They also concluded that for the stocks of companies &lt;br /&gt;capable of such growth, no p/e ratio was too high.  People extrapolated earnings growth &lt;br /&gt;of 20%-plus and paid p/e ratios of 50-plus.  Of course, when neither the growth nor the &lt;br /&gt;valuations turned out to be sustainable, losses of 90%-plus became the rule.  As always, &lt;br /&gt;the folly of projecting limitless growth became obvious in retrospect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exigencies of the corporate life cycle usually render ultra-high growth rates &lt;br /&gt;unsustainable.  Regardless of the improbability, however, investors indulge in "the willing &lt;br /&gt;suspension of disbelief" (which I always bring to the movies but check at the door when I &lt;br /&gt;come to work).  They assume that successful companies will be able to attract enough &lt;br /&gt;talent, develop enough new products, access e&lt;br /&gt;nough new markets, fend off competition &lt;br /&gt;while protecting high profit margins, and correctly make the strategic adaptations needed &lt;br /&gt;to keep growing . . . but it rarely works that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In February an article in Fortune magazine, covering 1960-80, 1970-90 and 1980-99, &lt;br /&gt;showed that out of 150 candidates among large companies, only four or five in each &lt;br /&gt;period were able to grow earnings per share at 15% per year on average.  Only one, Philip &lt;br /&gt;Morris, grew at that rate for all three periods.  The key for Philip Morris wasn't a &lt;br /&gt;technological miracle or a fabulous new growth product; it was solid blocking and &lt;br /&gt;tackling in areas of stable consumer demand.  So the latest "wonder-company" with a &lt;br /&gt;unique product rarely possesses the secret of rapid growth forever.  I think it's safer to &lt;br /&gt;expect a company's growth rate to regress toward the mean than it is to expect perpetual &lt;br /&gt;motion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UBusiness Fads and Fancies &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We all laugh about hemlines, which fluctuate from year to year and add nothing to society &lt;br /&gt;but cost.  The truth is, there's no place for them to go but up and down . . . and so they do.  &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, there are business trends that have nowhere to go but back and forth . . . and so &lt;br /&gt;they do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take corporate diversification, for example.  As a new equity analyst in 1970, one of my &lt;br /&gt;first assignments was to study conglomerates, starting with Litton, ITT, Whittaker, &lt;br /&gt;Teledyne and City Investing.  It was widely held that their diversification and synergies &lt;br /&gt;(along with the magic of acquisition accounting and high p/e "funny money") could &lt;br /&gt;produce rapid growth forever.  They pursued large numbers of acquisitions (ITT made 52 &lt;br /&gt;one year) and were rewarded with very high p/e ratios (which enabled them to prolong &lt;br /&gt;their growth for a while through further anti-dilutive acquisitions). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long, however, before their dependence on sky-high multiples was recognized &lt;br /&gt;and difficulties surfaced in connection with the management of their diverse &lt;br /&gt;organizations.  Their managers switched to stressing the benefits of specialization (as &lt;br /&gt;opposed to diversification), and the head of Whittaker wrote a paper extolling the virtues &lt;br /&gt;of a process he called "distillation of the product centroid."  Units began to be sold off &lt;br /&gt;and the companies deconglomerated.  It's interesting to note that none of those five &lt;br /&gt;companies exists today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diversification or specialization?  Centralization or decentralization?  Savings through &lt;br /&gt;just-in-time inventories or protection from stockpiles and redundancy?  Tough goal-&lt;br /&gt;oriented management or warm-and-fuzzy work environments?  Leverage on the upside &lt;br /&gt;through maximum debt or the safety that comes from a large equity cushion?  The &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pendulum in each of these continua can do nothing but swing back and forth, and so it &lt;br /&gt;does.  The answer is that there is no perfect answer.  Companies move toward one &lt;br /&gt;extreme as it become&lt;br /&gt;s more popular.  Then the drawbacks surface and they move back &lt;br /&gt;toward the other.  There's no place else for companies to move with regard to each of &lt;br /&gt;these questions, and so they cycle from one extreme to the other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, there are cyclical fluctuations in how business phenomena are viewed.  People &lt;br /&gt;move en masse toward one view, and when it turns out that no view can hold the answer, &lt;br /&gt;they move away from it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For example, in the 1990s, information technology was thought to hold the answer to &lt;br /&gt;increased corporate efficiency.  A great deal of the decade's bull market was fed by gains &lt;br /&gt;in productivity, which contributed greatly to both earnings and the p/e ratios investors &lt;br /&gt;applied to them.  Technology-derived gains in productivity were embraced as having &lt;br /&gt;fundamentally altered the growth potential of companies and the economy.  In testimony &lt;br /&gt;to the House of Representatives on February 23, 2000, Alan Greenspan said: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . there are few signs to date of slowing in the pace of innovation and the spread &lt;br /&gt;of our newer technologies that, as I have indicated in previous testimonies, have &lt;br /&gt;been at the root of our extraordinary productivity improvement.  Indeed, some &lt;br /&gt;analysts conjecture that we still may be in the earlier stages of the rapid adoption &lt;br /&gt;of new technologies and not yet in sight of the stage when this wave of innovation &lt;br /&gt;will crest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I know what did crest within 30 days: the stock market.  And on October 24, 2001, &lt;br /&gt;just twenty months later, a less expansive Mr. Greenspan was quoted in the Wall Street &lt;br /&gt;Journal as saying: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What the events of September 11 did was to introduce a whole new set of &lt;br /&gt;uncertainties which information technology is not going to improve our insight &lt;br /&gt;into.  And so it is a reversal of some of the forces that engendered the productivity &lt;br /&gt;acceleration of the last five years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, what had been thought to be a fundamental and durable change has &lt;br /&gt;proved to be one more development whose ability to wax and wane has to be &lt;br /&gt;acknowledged and watched.  The gains from productivity are proving to be cyclical, and &lt;br /&gt;the cycle shorter than had been expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Market Cycle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the University of Chicago, I was taught that the value of an asset is the discounted &lt;br /&gt;present value of its future cash flows.  If this is true, we should expect the prices of assets &lt;br /&gt;to change in line with changes in the outlook for their cash flows.  But we know that asset &lt;br /&gt;prices often rise and fall without regard for cash flows, and certainly by amounts that are &lt;br /&gt;entirely disproportionate to the changes in cash flows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance professors would say that these fluctuations reflect changes in the discount rate &lt;br /&gt;being applied to the cash flows or, in other words, changes in valuation parameters.  &lt;br /&gt;Practitioners would agree that changes in p/e ratios are respo&lt;br /&gt;nsible, and we all know that &lt;br /&gt;p/e ratios fluctuate much more radically than do company fundamentals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The market has a mind of its own, and its changes in valuation parameters, caused &lt;br /&gt;primarily by changes in investor psychology (not changes in fundamentals), that account &lt;br /&gt;for most short-term changes in security prices.  This psychology, too, moves in a highly &lt;br /&gt;cyclical manner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For decades – literally – I've been lugging around what I thought was a particularly &lt;br /&gt;apt enumeration of the three stages of a bull market: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; the first, when a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get &lt;br /&gt;better, &lt;br /&gt; the second, when most investors realize improvement is actually underway, and &lt;br /&gt; the third, when everyone concludes everything will get better forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone waste time trying for a better description?  This one says it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stocks are cheapest when everything looks grim.  The depressing outlook keeps them &lt;br /&gt;there, and only a few astute and daring bargain hunters are willing to take new positions.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe their buying attracts some attention, or maybe the outlook turns a little less &lt;br /&gt;depressing, but for one reason or another, the market starts moving up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a while, the outlook seems a little less poor.  People begin to appreciate that &lt;br /&gt;improvement is taking place, and it requires less imagination to be a buyer.  Of course, &lt;br /&gt;with the economy and market off the critical list, they pay prices that are more reflective &lt;br /&gt;of stocks' fair values. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And eventually, giddiness sets in.  Cheered by the improvement in economic and &lt;br /&gt;corporate results, people become willing to extrapolate it.  The masses become excited &lt;br /&gt;(and envious) about the profits made by investors who were early, and they want in.  And &lt;br /&gt;they ignore the cyclical nature of things and conclude that the gains will go on forever.  &lt;br /&gt;That's why I love the old adage "What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does &lt;br /&gt;in the end."  Most importantly, in the late stages of the great bull markets, people become &lt;br /&gt;willing to pay prices for stocks that assume the good times will go on ad infinitum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they cannot.  When the tech bubble was roaring ahead in late 1999, no one could &lt;br /&gt;think of any development that might be capable of bringing it to an end.  Technology was &lt;br /&gt;certain to revolutionize everyday life, creating a new investment paradigm.  Revenue &lt;br /&gt;growth (or at least the growth in "eye-balls") was strong.  Capital was freely available, &lt;br /&gt;enabling expansion to continue and new, innovative companies to be formed.  Cash flows &lt;br /&gt;into mutual funds and 401(k)s guaranteed steady demand for the stocks.  Each time &lt;br /&gt;another tech stock was added to an index, a whole new group of forced buyers was &lt;br /&gt;created among index funds and the active managers benchmarked against that index.  No &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UU&lt;br /&gt;portfolio manager could take the risk of under-owning these stocks; they had to buy &lt;br /&gt;t&lt;br /&gt;hem regardless of price!  Eureka!  There was no way they could stop going up.  The &lt;br /&gt;perpetual motion machine had been built. &lt;br /&gt;But somehow, the stocks did stop going up.  And then they started going down.  I don't &lt;br /&gt;think anyone can say just what it was that caused the tech bubble to burst.  Certainly I &lt;br /&gt;can't think of any one thing – even in hindsight, which is usually 20:20.  Maybe the &lt;br /&gt;gr&lt;br /&gt;oundwork was laid for declines when it was shown merely that the rise could slow.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe a few smart people, to paraphrase the third of the three stages, concluded that &lt;br /&gt;everything wouldn't get better forever.  The best explanation probably is that the prices &lt;br /&gt;just collapsed under their own weight. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the market proved – once again – that it can't move in one direction forever.  It &lt;br /&gt;has to be appreciated in cyclical terms, &lt;br /&gt;with increases followed by decreases, and &lt;br /&gt;in fact with increases causing decreases. &lt;br /&gt;In April 1991 , in just my second general memo to clients, I described the ma&lt;br /&gt;rket as &lt;br /&gt;follows: &lt;br /&gt;The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the movement of a &lt;br /&gt;pendulum.  Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the position of a &lt;br /&gt;pendulum "on average," it actually spends very little of its time there.  Instead, it &lt;br /&gt;is almost always swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc.  But &lt;br /&gt;whenever the pendulum is near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move &lt;br /&gt;back toward the midpoint sooner or later.  In fact, it is the movement toward an &lt;br /&gt;extreme itself that supplies the energy for the swing back. &lt;br /&gt;Investment markets make the same pendulum-like swing: &lt;br /&gt;between euphoria and depression,&lt;br /&gt;between celebrating positive developments and obsessing ov&lt;br /&gt;er negatives, and&lt;br /&gt;thus&lt;br /&gt;between overpriced and underpriced.&lt;br /&gt;The swing of the pendulum?  The oscillation of the cycle?  Either way's fine – just don't &lt;br /&gt;tell me it'll be a straight line. &lt;br /&gt;In 1999, the Wall Street Journal ran a number of OpEd pieces by James Glassman and &lt;br /&gt;Kevin Hassett trumpeting the theory behind the book "Dow 36,000."  I couldn'&lt;br /&gt;t think of &lt;br /&gt;anything that made less sense.  By last month, it seemed the Journal's story had changed: &lt;br /&gt;With economic conditions turning downward so quickly, pushed along by the &lt;br /&gt;events of Sept. 11, a lot of business books have been rendered irrelevant, even &lt;br /&gt;silly.  Anyone remember "Dow 36,000"? &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How quickly views change, and how quickly the logical-sounding rationale for lofty or &lt;br /&gt;depressed prices is shown in retrospect to have been "silly." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*          *          * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The risks entailed in ignoring the inherently cyclical nature of things are manifold, and &lt;br /&gt;the various cycles interact, often in wa&lt;br /&gt;ys that surprise the optimists.  On October 26 the &lt;br /&gt;beautifully written (but inaptly-titled) "Grant's Interest Rate Observer" described the &lt;br /&gt;situation at a fallen telecommunications giant as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the New Economy, the front office seemed persuaded, there would be no &lt;br /&gt;recession (let alone a global recession) and no bear market (especially one &lt;br /&gt;concentrated in technology).  There would be no pause in the growth of the &lt;br /&gt;demand for broadband, no collapse in the price of broadband access and no credit &lt;br /&gt;contraction.  What we are looking at . . . is compressed cash flow at the trough in a &lt;br /&gt;cyclical business so new that its proponents have yet to discover that it is, in fact, &lt;br /&gt;cyclical. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This example represents a four-bagger.  It seems the company's management ignored the &lt;br /&gt;cyclicality of (l) the economy, (2) the stock market, (3) the availability of credit, and (4) &lt;br /&gt;the demand and price for its product.  As in this case, the failure to prepare for cycles &lt;br /&gt;usually leads to what later are perceived as obvious, easily-avoided mistakes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UCycles and How To Live With Them &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one knew when the tech bubble would burst, and no one knew what the extent of the &lt;br /&gt;correction could be or how long it would last.  But it wasn't impossible to get a sense that &lt;br /&gt;the market was euphoric and investors were behaving in an unquestioning, giddy manner.  &lt;br /&gt;That was all it would have taken to avoid a great deal of the carnage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I want to point out emphatically that many of those who complained &lt;br /&gt;about the excessive market valuations – including me – started to do so years too soon.  &lt;br /&gt;And for a long time, another of my old standards was proved true: "being too far ahead of &lt;br /&gt;your time is indistinguishable from being wrong."  Some of the cautious investors ran out &lt;br /&gt;of staying power, losing their jobs or their clients because of having missed the gains.  &lt;br /&gt;Some capitulated and, having missed the gains, jumped in just in time to participate in the &lt;br /&gt;losses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I'm not trying to give the impression that coping with cycles is easy.  But I do &lt;br /&gt;think it's a necessary effort.  We may never know where we're going, or when the &lt;br /&gt;tide will turn, but we had better have a good idea where we are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;November 20, 2001 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2001 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Realist's Creed  &lt;br /&gt;Early this year, I was asked to write an article for "Trusts &amp; Estates" magazine.  Here it is, &lt;br /&gt;in part cobbled together from things I've written in the past, and slightly changed from the &lt;br /&gt;version that was published in April. &lt;br /&gt;The editors wanted me to recommend a course of investment action for beneficiaries and &lt;br /&gt;their fiduciaries.  To most people that means deciding how much to put into stocks and &lt;br /&gt;bonds (and which ones), and whether private equity and hedge funds should be included.  &lt;br /&gt;It usually sounds easy: all you have to do is make a few si&lt;br /&gt;mple judgments about the &lt;br /&gt;future.  I decided to write a very different article: it's going to tell you how hard investing &lt;br /&gt;is, and how you can best equip yourself for the task. &lt;br /&gt;FirstU, I think investing must be based on a firmly held belief system.  What do you &lt;br /&gt;believe in, and what do you reject?  Put another way, what are the principles that will &lt;br /&gt;guide you? &lt;br /&gt;For me, the starting point consists of deciding which approach to take in dealing with the &lt;br /&gt;future.  That decision primarily revolves around choosing between two polar opposites: &lt;br /&gt;what I call the "I know" school and the "I don't know" school. &lt;br /&gt;Most of the investment professionals I've met over my 33 years in the industry fall &lt;br /&gt;squarely into the "I know" school.  These are people who believe they can discern what &lt;br /&gt;the future holds, and in their world investing is a simple matter: &lt;br /&gt;First you decide what the economy is going to do in the period under consideration.&lt;br /&gt;Then you figure out what the impact will be on interest rates.&lt;br /&gt;From this you infer how the securities m&lt;br /&gt;arkets will perform.&lt;br /&gt;You choose the industries that will do best in that environment.&lt;br /&gt;You make judgments about how the industries' companies will fare in terms of profits.&lt;br /&gt;Based on all of this information, you pick stocks that are bound to appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;End of story.  Of course, the usefulness of this approach depends entirely on people's &lt;br /&gt;ability to make these decisions correctly.  What if you're wrong about the economy?  &lt;br /&gt;What if you're right about the economy but wrong about its impact on a company's &lt;br /&gt;profits?&lt;br /&gt;  Or what if you're right about profits but the valuation parameters contract, and &lt;br /&gt;thus the price?  The bottom line is that the members of this school think these things are &lt;br /&gt;knowable.  I know lots of people who are perpetually and constitutionally optimistic &lt;br /&gt;about both the long-term future for stocks &lt;br /&gt;UandU their ability to make these judgments &lt;br /&gt;correctly. &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I and most of the investors with whom I feel an affinity belong to the &lt;br /&gt;"I don't know" school.  In short, (1) we feel it's impossible for anyone to know much &lt;br /&gt;about a vast number of things, (2) we&lt;br /&gt; consider it especially difficult to outperform by &lt;br /&gt;guessing right about the direction of the economy and the markets, (3) we spend our time &lt;br /&gt;trying to know more than the next person about specific micro situations, and (4) we think &lt;br /&gt;more about what can go wrong than about what can go right.  In contrast to the "I know" &lt;br /&gt;school, people in this group are more cautious and feel a strong need for d&lt;br /&gt;ownside &lt;br /&gt;protection. &lt;br /&gt;Sticking to this approach requires som&lt;br /&gt;e solid building blocks.  One of those is &lt;br /&gt;contrarianism.  Basically that means leaning away from the direction chosen by most &lt;br /&gt;others.  Sell when they're euphoric, and buy when they're afraid.  Sell what they love, and &lt;br /&gt;buy what they hate.  In general, I think you'll find few bargains among the investments &lt;br /&gt;that everyone knows about, understands, feels comfortable with, is impressed by and is &lt;br /&gt;eager to own.  Instead, the best bargains usually lie am&lt;br /&gt;ong the things people aren't aware &lt;br /&gt;of, don't fully understand, or consider arcane, unseemly or risky. &lt;br /&gt;Closely related to contrarianism is skepticism.  It's a simple concept, but it has great &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;otential for keeping investors out of trouble: If it sounds too good to be true, it &lt;br /&gt;probably is.  That phrase is always heard after    the losses have piled up – be it in &lt;br /&gt;portfolio insurance, "market neutral" funds, dot-coms, or Enron.  My career in money &lt;br /&gt;management has been based on the conviction that free lunches do exist, but not for &lt;br /&gt;everyone, or where everyone's looking, or without hard work and superior skill.  &lt;br /&gt;Skepticism needn't make you give up on superior risk-adjusted returns, but it should make &lt;br /&gt;y&lt;br /&gt;ou ask tough questions about the ease of accessing them. &lt;br /&gt;Thus I also advocate modest expectations.  To shoot for top-quartile performance every &lt;br /&gt;year, you have to hold an idiosyncratic portfolio that exposes you to the risk of being &lt;br /&gt;o&lt;br /&gt;utside the pack and dead wrong.  It's behavior like that that leads to managers being &lt;br /&gt;carried off the field when things go poorly – and to clients losing lots of money.  It's far &lt;br /&gt;more reasonable just to try for performance that's consistently a little above average.  &lt;br /&gt;Even that's not easy to achieve, but if accomplished for a long period it will result in an &lt;br /&gt;outstanding track record. &lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt; think humility is essential, especially concerning the ability to know the future.  Before &lt;br /&gt;acting on a forecast, we must ask whether there's good reason to think we're more right &lt;br /&gt;than the consensus view already em&lt;br /&gt;bodied in prices.  I think it's possible to get a &lt;br /&gt;knowledge advantage with regard to under-researched companies and securities, but only &lt;br /&gt;through hard work and skill. &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I'm a strong believer in investing defensively.  That means worrying about what &lt;br /&gt;one may not know, about what can go wrong, and about losing money.  If you're worried, &lt;br /&gt;you'll tend to build in greater margin for error.  Wo&lt;br /&gt;rriers gain less when everything goes &lt;br /&gt;right, but they also lose less – and stay in the game – when things return to earth.  All of &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree' &lt;br /&gt;s activities are guided more by one principle than any other: if we avoid the &lt;br /&gt;losers, the winners will take care of themselves.  We're much more concerned &lt;br /&gt;about &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;participating in a loser than we are about letting a winner get away.  In my experience, &lt;br /&gt;long-term investment success can be built much more reliably on the avoidance of &lt;br /&gt;significant losses than it can on the quest for outsized gains.  A high batting average, not a &lt;br /&gt;swing-for-the-fences style, offers the most dependable route to success. &lt;br /&gt;USecondU, I'd advise you to approach the entire subject of forecasts and forecasters &lt;br /&gt;with extreme distrust.  Reduced to the absolute minimum, investing consists of just one &lt;br /&gt;thing: &lt;br /&gt;Making judgments about the future.  And the future is inherently uncertain.  Everyone &lt;br /&gt;looks for help in dealing with this uncertainty, and their usual recourse is to put faith in &lt;br /&gt;forecasters.  How could they not?  Most forecasters are highly articulate, represent &lt;br /&gt;prestigious institutions, and exude total confidence in their knowledge of the future. &lt;br /&gt;The problem, however, is that they're not often right, or at least not consistently more &lt;br /&gt;right than others.  And almost never do they (or anyone else) record and assess their &lt;br /&gt;accuracy ov&lt;br /&gt;er time.  Here's the way I view the forecasting game. &lt;br /&gt;•There are hundreds, or more likely thousands, of people out there trying to predict the &lt;br /&gt;f&lt;br /&gt;uture, but no one has a record much better than anyone else.  Given how valuable &lt;br /&gt;superior forecasts can be, recipients should wonder why anyone who was capable &lt;br /&gt;of consistently making them&lt;br /&gt; would distribute them gratis.&lt;br /&gt;•Market prices for assets already incorporate the views of the consensus of forecasters. &lt;br /&gt;Thus holding a consensus view, even if it's right, can't help you make above-average &lt;br /&gt;returns.&lt;br /&gt;•Non-consensus views can make you a lot of money, but to do so they must be right. &lt;br /&gt;Because the consensus reflects the forecasting efforts of a large number of intelligent &lt;br /&gt;and informed people, however, it's usually the closest we can get to right.  In other &lt;br /&gt;words, I doubt there's anyone out there with non-consensus views that are right &lt;br /&gt;routinely.&lt;br /&gt;•Most of the time, the consensus forecast extrap&lt;br /&gt;olates current observations.  Predictions &lt;br /&gt;for a given parameter usually bear a strong resemblance to the level of the parameter &lt;br /&gt;prevailing at the time they're made.  Thus predictions are often close to right when &lt;br /&gt;nothing changes radically, which is the case most of the time, but they can't be counted &lt;br /&gt;on to foretell the important sea changes.  And as my friend Ric Kayne says,&lt;br /&gt;"everything important in financial history has taken place outside of two standard &lt;br /&gt;deviations."  It's in predicting radical change that extraordinary profit potential exists. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, it's the surprises&lt;br /&gt; that have profound market impact (and thus&lt;br /&gt;U U&lt;br /&gt;profound profit potential), but there's a good reason why they're called surprises: &lt;br /&gt;it's hard to see them coming!&lt;br /&gt;•Each time a radical change occurs, there's someone who predicted it, and that person &lt;br /&gt;gets to enjoy his fifteen minutes of fame.  Usually, however, he wasn't right because&lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of a superior ability to see the future, but rather because he regularly holds extreme &lt;br /&gt;positions (or perhaps he's a dart thrower) and this time the phenomenon went his way.  &lt;br /&gt;Rarely if ever is that person right twice in a row. &lt;br /&gt;So forecasts are unlikely to help us gain an advantage, but that doesn't make people stop &lt;br /&gt;putting their faith in them.  It's unsettling to realize how much in the dark we investors are &lt;br /&gt;concerning future developments.  But there's one thing worse: to ignore the limits of our &lt;br /&gt;foresight.  The late Stanford behaviorist Amos Tversky put it best: "It's frightening to &lt;br /&gt;think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and &lt;br /&gt;large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what's going &lt;br /&gt;on." &lt;br /&gt;UThirdU, I think it's essential to remember that just about everything is cyclical.  &lt;br /&gt;There's little I'm certain of, but these things are true: Cycles always prevail eventually.  &lt;br /&gt;Nothing goes in one direction forever.  Trees don't grow to the sky. Few things go to zero.  &lt;br /&gt;And there's little that's as dangerous for investor health as insistence on &lt;br /&gt;extrapolating today's events into the future. &lt;br /&gt;The economy will not rise forever.  Industrial trends won't continue indefinitely.  The &lt;br /&gt;companies that succeed for a while often will cease to do so.  Company profits won't &lt;br /&gt;increase without limitation.  Investor psychology won't go in one direction forever, and &lt;br /&gt;thus neither will security prices.  An investment style that does best (or worst) in one &lt;br /&gt;period is unlikely to do so again in the next. &lt;br /&gt;That was really the problem with the technology bubble.  Investors were willing to pay &lt;br /&gt;prices that assume&lt;br /&gt;d success forever.  They ignored the economic cycle, the credit cycle &lt;br /&gt;and, most importantly, the corporate life cycle.  They forgot that profitability would bring &lt;br /&gt;imitation and competition, which would cut into – or eliminate – profitability.  They &lt;br /&gt;overlooked the fact that the same powerful force that made their companies attractive – &lt;br /&gt;technological progress – could at some point render them obsolete.  And they failed to &lt;br /&gt;consider that the investing fads in favor of these technologies, companies and stocks &lt;br /&gt;could reverse, with dire consequences. &lt;br /&gt;UFourthU, investors should bear in mind the role played by timeframe.  It seems &lt;br /&gt;obvious, but long-term trends need time in order to work out, and time can be limited.  Or &lt;br /&gt;as John Maynard Keynes put it, "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can &lt;br /&gt;remain solvent."  Whenever you're tempted to bet heavily on your conviction that a given &lt;br /&gt;phenomenon can be depended on in the long run, think about the six-foot tall man who &lt;br /&gt;drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on average. &lt;br /&gt;One of the great delusions suffered in the 1990s was that "stocks always outperform."  I &lt;br /&gt;agree that stocks can be counted on to beat bonds, cash and inflation, as Wharton's Prof. &lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Siegel dem&lt;br /&gt;onstrated, but only with the qualification "in the long run."  If you have &lt;br /&gt;thirty years, it's reasonable to expect equity returns to be superior to those on bonds.  For &lt;br /&gt;someone with a thirty-year timeframe, the NASDAQ's decline since 2000 may turn out to &lt;br /&gt;be a matter of indifference.  But it hasn't felt that way to the people holding the stocks. &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for time came into play in another way for the technology and &lt;br /&gt;telecommunications entrepreneurs.  Many raised the money they needed for a year or two &lt;br /&gt;and proceeded to burn it up.  They counted on being able to raise more later, but in 2000-02 &lt;br /&gt;capital has been denied even to worthwhile ideas.  Lots of companies never got the chance &lt;br /&gt;to reach profitability.  They simply ran out of time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UFifthU, you must never forget the key role played by valuation.  Investment success &lt;br /&gt;doesn't come primarily from "buying good things," but rather from "buying things well" &lt;br /&gt;(and the difference isn't just grammatical).  It's easy for most people to tell the &lt;br /&gt;difference between a good company and a bad one, but much harder for them to &lt;br /&gt;understand the difference between a cheap stock and an expensive one.  Some of the &lt;br /&gt;biggest losses occur when people buy the stocks of great companies at too-high prices.  In &lt;br /&gt;contrast, investing in terrible companies can produce huge profits if it's done at the right &lt;br /&gt;price.  Over time, investors may shift their focus from dividend yield to p/e ratio, and they &lt;br /&gt;may stop looking at book value, but that doesn't mean valuation can be considered &lt;br /&gt;irrelevant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the tech bubble, buyers didn't worry about whether a stock was priced too high because &lt;br /&gt;they were sure someone else would be willing to pay them more for it.  Unfortunately, &lt;br /&gt;this "greater fool theory" only works until it doesn't.  They also thought the technological &lt;br /&gt;developments were so great that the companies' stocks could be bought regardless of &lt;br /&gt;price.  In the end, though, when newness becomes old, flaws appear and investor ardor &lt;br /&gt;cools, the only thing that matters is the stock's price . . . and it's usually much lower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most shortages – whether of commodities or securities – ease when high prices inevitably &lt;br /&gt;cause supply to rise and satisfy the demand.  And no fad lasts forever.  Thus valuation &lt;br /&gt;eventually comes into play, and those who are holding the bag when it does are forced to &lt;br /&gt;face the music. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;USixthU, beware the quest for the simple solution.  Two important forces drive the search &lt;br /&gt;for investment options: the urge to make money and the desire for help in negotiating the &lt;br /&gt;uncertain future.  When a market, an individual or an investment technique produces &lt;br /&gt;impressive returns for a while, it generally attracts excessive (and unquestioning) &lt;br /&gt;devotion.  I call this solution-du-jour the "silver bullet." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investors are always looking for it.  Call it the Holy Grail or the free lunch, but everyone &lt;br /&gt;wants a ticket to riches without risk.  Few people question whether it can exist, or why it &lt;br /&gt;should be available to them.  At the bottom line, hope springs eternal.  Thus investors &lt;br /&gt;pursued Nifty-Fifty growth stock investing in the 1970s, portfolio insurance in the '80s, and &lt;br /&gt;the technology boom of the '90s.  They aligned themselves with "geniuses" they thought &lt;br /&gt;would make investing easy – be it Joe Granville, Elaine Garzarelli or Henry Blodgett. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the silver bullet doesn't exist.  No strategy can produce high rates of return without &lt;br /&gt;risk.  And nobody has all the answers; we're all just human.  Markets are highly &lt;br /&gt;dynamic and, among other things, they function over time to take away the &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opportunity for unusual profits.  Unskeptical belief that the silver bullet is at hand &lt;br /&gt;eventually leads to capital punishment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;USeventhU, you must be aware of what's going on around you in terms of investor &lt;br /&gt;psychology.  I don't believe in the ability of forecasters to tell us where prices are going, &lt;br /&gt;but an understanding of where we are in terms of investor psychology can give us a hint.  &lt;br /&gt;When investors are exuberant, as they were in 1999 and early 2000, it's dangerous.  When &lt;br /&gt;the man on the street thinks stocks are a great idea and sure to produce profits, I'd watch &lt;br /&gt;out.  When attitudes of this sort make for stock prices that assume the best and &lt;br /&gt;incorporate no fear, it's a formula for disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find myself using one quote, from Warren Buffett, more often than any other: "The less &lt;br /&gt;prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater prudence with which &lt;br /&gt;we should conduct our own affairs."  When others are euphoric, that puts us in danger.  &lt;br /&gt;When others are frightened and pull back, their behavior makes bargains plentiful.  In &lt;br /&gt;other words, what others are thinking and doing holds substantial ramifications for you.  &lt;br /&gt;And that brings us full circle to the importance of contrarianism. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*          *          * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've cataloged above the "mental arsenal" I feel is needed in the battle for investment &lt;br /&gt;success.  I'll proceed below to illustrate the application of some of these concepts to two &lt;br /&gt;key asset classes: common stocks, the grand-daddy of all active investments, and hedge &lt;br /&gt;funds, a much smaller area that is in the process of attracting a lot of attention (and &lt;br /&gt;capital). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UCommon stocksU – Among the mantras that were repeated in the past decade, few &lt;br /&gt;received as much credence as "stocks outperform."  Wharton's Professor Jeremy Siegel &lt;br /&gt;documented in his book, "Stocks for the Long Run," that equities have beaten bonds, cash &lt;br /&gt;and inflation over almost all long periods of time.  In fact, his graph of the movements of &lt;br /&gt;the stock market since 1800 looks like a straight line rising from lower left to upper right.  &lt;br /&gt;Evidence like this allowed people to invest heavily in the stock market while continuing &lt;br /&gt;to sleep well.  Little did they know that the price gains that made them feel so sanguine &lt;br /&gt;about their positions were dramatically increasing their risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am a great believer in common stock investing, but I hold tight to a few caveats: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Return expectations must be reasonable. &lt;br /&gt; The ride won't be without bumps. &lt;br /&gt; It's not easy to get above-market returns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We live in the world's most productive economy, under a very effective capitalist system, &lt;br /&gt;at a wonderful point in time.  In general, it's great to own productive assets like &lt;br /&gt;companies and their shares.  But occasionally, people lose track of the fact that in the &lt;br /&gt;long run, shares can't do much better than the companies that issue them.  Or to &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paraphrase Warren Buffett, when people forget that corporate profits grow at 8 or 9% per &lt;br /&gt;year, they tend to get into trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's never clear what base period makes for a relevant comparison, but between 1930 and &lt;br /&gt;1990, annual returns from stocks averaged about 10% year.  Periods when they did better &lt;br /&gt;were followed by periods when they did worse.  The better periods were usually caused &lt;br /&gt;by the expansion of p/e ratios, but valuations tended to return from the stratosphere, and &lt;br /&gt;in the long run, returns roughly paralleled profit growth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There always will be bull markets and bear markets.  The bull markets will be welcomed &lt;br /&gt;warmly and unskeptically, because people will be making money.  These markets will be &lt;br /&gt;propelled to great heights, usually by the rationalization that "it's different this time"; that &lt;br /&gt;productivity, technology, globalization, lower taxation – something – has permanently &lt;br /&gt;elevated the prospective return from stocks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bear markets will come as a shock to the unsuspecting, demonstrating that, most of &lt;br /&gt;the time, the world doesn't change that much.  For example, when you look at Siegel's &lt;br /&gt;200-year straight-line stock market graph, no hiccup is visible in 1973-74.  Try telling &lt;br /&gt;that to the average equity investor, who lost half his money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that risk of fluctuation always is present.  Thus stocks are risky unless &lt;br /&gt;your time frame truly allows you to live through the downs while awaiting the ups.  &lt;br /&gt;Remember what Lord Keynes said about the ability of markets to remain irrational for &lt;br /&gt;long periods of time.  And remember that it's possible for you to be forced to sell at the &lt;br /&gt;bottom – by emotions, competitive pressure or the need for liquidity – turning temporary &lt;br /&gt;volatility (the theoretical definition of risk) into very real permanent loss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In order to get more out of the ups of stocks and try to lessen the pain of the downs, most &lt;br /&gt;people turn to active management via market timing, group rotation, industry emphasis &lt;br /&gt;and stock selection.  But it's just not that easy.  The American Way – earnestly applying &lt;br /&gt;elbow grease – doesn't often payoff.  For a model, don't think about the diligent &lt;br /&gt;paperboy on his route; think about trying to profit from flipping a coin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I say that because I believe most markets are relatively "efficient," and that certainly &lt;br /&gt;includes the mainstream stock market.  Where large numbers of investors are aware of an &lt;br /&gt;asset's existence, have roughly equal access to information and are diligently working to &lt;br /&gt;evaluate it, the market operates to incorporate their collective interpretation of the &lt;br /&gt;information into a market price.  While that price is often wrong, very few investors are &lt;br /&gt;capable of consistently knowing when it is, and by how much, and in which direction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The evidence is clear: most investors underperform the market.  They (a) can't see the &lt;br /&gt;future, (b) make mistakes that keep them at a disadvantage, (c) accept high risk in their &lt;br /&gt;effort to distinguish themselves, and (d) spend money trying (in the form of market &lt;br /&gt;impact and transaction costs). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are individuals who beat the market by substantial margins, and &lt;br /&gt;they become famous.  The mere fact that they attract so much attention proves how &lt;br /&gt;rare they are.  (That's the meaning of the adage "it's the exception that proves the rule.")  &lt;br /&gt;Adding to return without adding commensurately to risk requires rare understanding of &lt;br /&gt;how money is made and what constitutes value.  Far more managers promise it than &lt;br /&gt;deliver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most active managers go through times when their biases or their guesses lead them to do &lt;br /&gt;things that beat their assigned benchmark, which they attribute to their skill, and times &lt;br /&gt;that are the opposite, which they attribute to being blindsided by the unforeseeable (or to &lt;br /&gt;some defect in the benchmark).  But these are two sides of the same coin, and in the long &lt;br /&gt;run the average manager adds little.  Usually, active management will not allow you to &lt;br /&gt;beat the stock market, or to enjoy the fruits of the market without fully bearing its risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do I view the outlook for stocks?  The period since I started managing money in &lt;br /&gt;1978 has been incredible.  There were a few bad days and quarters, but through 1999 &lt;br /&gt;there wasn't a single year when the S&amp;P 500 lost 5%.  From 1978 through 1999, the &lt;br /&gt;return on the S&amp;P 500 averaged 17.6% per year.  That rose to 20.6% for 1991-99 and &lt;br /&gt;28.3% for 1995-99.  I doubt there's ever been a better 22-year run; to ask for more would &lt;br /&gt;be just plain piggish.  But I don't think it'll be anything like that in the years just ahead, &lt;br /&gt;and of course there's been a considerable correction already. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The observers I most respect foresee single digit average returns for common stocks, and &lt;br /&gt;I agree.  Equity returns have three components: profit increase, multiple expansion and &lt;br /&gt;dividend yield.  The last is minimal and the second can't be counted on from here.  So that &lt;br /&gt;means we're down to the rate of increase in corporate profits, which is likely to be in &lt;br /&gt;single digits.  Single digit returns would be below the historic average, but after such a &lt;br /&gt;great 22-year run, a little less wouldn't be unreasonable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UHedge FundsU – Perhaps because they were new to the market, many who participated in &lt;br /&gt;the equity boom of the late 1990s were surprised by the suddenness with which their &lt;br /&gt;profits evaporated in the subsequent correction.  Now they're looking for a new path to &lt;br /&gt;profit without risk, and many think they've found it in hedge funds.  Their reasons for &lt;br /&gt;migrating include the good performance of hedge funds, especially amid the recent chaos, &lt;br /&gt;and the modest prospective returns available in the mainstream stock and bond markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, how about a definition.  Generally speaking, a hedge fund is an unregulated, private &lt;br /&gt;investment partnership whose manager receives a percentage of the profits.  To "hedge" is &lt;br /&gt;to intentionally include positions that can be depended on to move counter to each other &lt;br /&gt;under most circumstances, and thereby to mitigate exposure to developments in the &lt;br /&gt;environment.  "Hedge fund" is a misnomer for many of today's funds, however, because &lt;br /&gt;unlike the days when the term first arose, hedging has become far from universal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The funds I'm interested in do hedge.  They're designed to systematically take advantage &lt;br /&gt;of market inefficiencies and to capture managers' skill while limiting susceptibility to &lt;br /&gt;market fluctuations.  Arbitrage, long/short, hedge and market-neutral strategies fall into &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this category.  Most strive to earn returns in the teens on a consistent basis, with relative &lt;br /&gt;indifference and insensitivity to the performance of the mainstream markets.  If they can &lt;br /&gt;do it, they're a great idea. &lt;br /&gt;Today, hedge funds, also sometimes called "absolute return" funds, are being promoted &lt;br /&gt;heavily by brokerage firms, mutual fund organizations and investment advisers and &lt;br /&gt;popularized by the media.  They are in the process of becoming the next investment fad.  &lt;br /&gt;And there's good reason why they should.  Especially given the weak competition I see &lt;br /&gt;coming from mainstream investment media like stocks, an appropriate mantra for the &lt;br /&gt;coming decade might be "low double digits ain't bad."  If you can identify investment &lt;br /&gt;managers who possess enough skill to consistently deliver such returns, you should hire &lt;br /&gt;them.  And there's a better-than-average chance they'll be found in the hedge fund arena, &lt;br /&gt;where the managers get to share in the profits. &lt;br /&gt;However, a few caveats are in order: &lt;br /&gt;Expectations still must be reasonable.  Investors must realize that very few&lt;br /&gt;managers are truly capable of earning before-fee returns of 12% or 15% steadily and&lt;br /&gt;with low cor&lt;br /&gt;relation to the mainstream markets.  Anything approaching 20% is&lt;br /&gt;Herculean.&lt;br /&gt;Most returns really won't be "absolute."  I have seen lots of "hedge funds" and&lt;br /&gt;"market neutral funds" drop precipitously.  That's because it's unusual for portfolio&lt;br /&gt;returns to be entirely d&lt;br /&gt;ivorced from their environment.  "Zero correlation" with the&lt;br /&gt;market is rarely attainable; "low correlation" may have to suffice.&lt;br /&gt;Money flows will play a big role.  In general, the good records have been built on&lt;br /&gt;small amounts of m&lt;br /&gt;oney.  And those records will attract large amounts of money.&lt;br /&gt;There are several consequences.&lt;br /&gt;First, records simply may not be capable of extrapolation.  To handle more money, a&lt;br /&gt;manager may have to invest faster, reduce selectivity, put more dollar&lt;br /&gt;s into each&lt;br /&gt;position, put on a larger number of positions, broaden the fund's range of&lt;br /&gt;activities, and/or add new staff members.  All of these can have negative&lt;br /&gt;implications for returns.&lt;br /&gt;Second, many of the best managers with skill UandU discipline are already closed to new&lt;br /&gt;money, or will reach the point when they are.  Thus in the extreme, as Groucho Marx&lt;br /&gt;would have put it, "I would never invest my money with anyone who'd take it."&lt;br /&gt;And third, when there's too much money in an area, even funds that are closed can be&lt;br /&gt;affected.  Long-Term Capital Management  found others emulating its trades and&lt;br /&gt;eventually lost its opportunity because too much money had piled into its niches.&lt;br /&gt;The wrong people will get money.  The rush to invest in an area gives money to&lt;br /&gt;managers who shouldn't get it.  &lt;br /&gt;When the best are closed, the rest will be funded.&lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-string managers will split off from established groups and get money based on &lt;br /&gt;their old fund's record (regardless of how much of it they were responsible for).  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;as the amount of money in the area rises, the average quality of the managers may &lt;br /&gt;fall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fees can eat up skill.  When the demand for funds outstrips supply, fund managers &lt;br /&gt;have the ability to raise fees and thereby appropriate for themselves a larger portion of &lt;br /&gt;their funds' returns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Disappointments will be many.  Due to the factors enumerated above, the next few &lt;br /&gt;years will see many investors fail to get what they hoped for . . . as usual.  One of my &lt;br /&gt;favorite sayings is "what the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the &lt;br /&gt;end."  Over the last 20-30 years, a few talented hedge fund managers built successful &lt;br /&gt;records with relatively small amounts of capital.  I believe the period ahead will see &lt;br /&gt;lots of people raise more than they should; thus it will have to be navigated with care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All investment trends run a high risk of being carried to extremes.  (For a shining &lt;br /&gt;example, take a look at venture capital in 2000.)  Despite this, I think absolute return &lt;br /&gt;investing deserves your attention.  But you should commit only after a lot of investigation &lt;br /&gt;and with your eyes wide open.  Remember, there is no such thing as a silver bullet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*          *          * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The main thing I've tried to indicate here is that investing isn't easy.  Or better put, &lt;br /&gt;UsuperiorU investing isn't easy.  It's easy to do average.  In fact, there are vehicles – index &lt;br /&gt;funds – that exist for the explicit purpose of delivering average performance at low cost, &lt;br /&gt;and they are completely capable of doing so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But most people want to do better than the average.  They want higher returns, and &lt;br /&gt;achieving higher returns without assuming commensurately higher risk is the hard part. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's easy to make guesses about the future but hard to be consistently more right in those &lt;br /&gt;guesses than your fellow investor, and thus hard to consistently outperform.  Doing the &lt;br /&gt;same thing others do exposes you to fluctuations that in part are exaggerated by their &lt;br /&gt;actions and your own.  It's certainly undesirable to be part of the herd when it stampedes &lt;br /&gt;off the cliff, but it takes rare skill, insight and discipline to avoid it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing I'm surest of is that the solution doesn't lie in making guesses about the big-&lt;br /&gt;picture future.  Rather, it lies with investors who possess skill, insight and discipline.  &lt;br /&gt;There are times when they'll underperform – times like 1998-99, when aggressiveness &lt;br /&gt;was rewarded far more than caution.  But if you can find those people, you should stick &lt;br /&gt;with them.  For me, the laundry list of their desired characteristics is clear: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; adherence to the "I don't know" school of thought &lt;br /&gt; contrarianism, skepticism, modest expectations, humility and defensiveness &lt;br /&gt; eschewing of macro forecasts &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; attention to the cyclical nature of things &lt;br /&gt; consciousness of timeframe &lt;br /&gt; concentration on valuation &lt;br /&gt; disdaining the hunt for the silver bullet &lt;br /&gt; awareness of prevailing investor psychology &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can go with opinions about the future.  Everyone's got them, and what they call for in &lt;br /&gt;terms of investment behavior usually is obvious.  In other words, the "I know" school &lt;br /&gt;makes investing sound easy – although in my opinion it's not often right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or you can join me in the "I don't know" school, where you must: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; face up to the uncertainty that surrounds the macro future; &lt;br /&gt; concentrate on avoiding pitfalls; &lt;br /&gt; invest in a few areas of specialization based on in-depth analysis, conservatively &lt;br /&gt;estimated tangible values and modest purchase prices; and &lt;br /&gt; be prepared for returns that trail the risk-takers when markets are hot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This may be the less common path, and certainly the less rosy, but it's the one I'd &lt;br /&gt;much rather count on for success in the long run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;May 31, 2002 &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: Returns and How They Get That Way &lt;br /&gt;"Where do babies come from?"  When I was a kid, this was the subject of a great many &lt;br /&gt;jokes, and the answer was always the same: "The stork brings them."  Now it's fifty years &lt;br /&gt;later, and no one jokes about the stork any more.  Maybe that's because today's kids learn &lt;br /&gt;the real answer so much sooner than we did. &lt;br /&gt;Where do equity retur&lt;br /&gt;ns come from? &lt;br /&gt; Fewer people ask this question than asked about &lt;br /&gt;the stork fifty years ago, . . . and even fewer have the answer.  I'll give you one hint: it's &lt;br /&gt;not from the stork. &lt;br /&gt;The Source of Equity Returns &lt;br /&gt;In the late 1990s, stock prices exploded upward, along with the number of people buying &lt;br /&gt;them.  And as long as stock prices rose, the new investors felt they knew all they had to &lt;br /&gt;about where equity returns came from: They came from rising prices.  And surely you &lt;br /&gt;could depend on prices to rise. &lt;br /&gt;What was it that investors thought would cause a given stock's price to rise? &lt;br /&gt;It's been performing like a rocket.&lt;br /&gt;It's the subject of a brokerage house recommendation, a TV or magazine story, or&lt;br /&gt;some chat room hype.&lt;br /&gt;Someone (I don't remember who) is recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;It's selling below an analyst's target price.&lt;br /&gt;Other people can be counted on to buy it, taking it ever higher.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, investors have to buy it, because money will keep flowing to stocks and&lt;br /&gt;people can't risk omitting thi&lt;br /&gt;s one from their portfolios.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe it'll become part of the S&amp;P 500, and indexers and closet indexers will have&lt;br /&gt;to add it to their portfolios.&lt;br /&gt;As always, however, the post mortem is more thorough than the simplistic thought &lt;br /&gt;process that preceded it, and the results are a lot less pleasant.  &lt;br /&gt;Dreams of ever-rising &lt;br /&gt;prices aren't enough.  Now we know there has to be a reason why prices should rise. &lt;br /&gt;Today, cooler heads point out that long-term equity returns are driven by dividends and &lt;br /&gt;earnings growth. &lt;br /&gt; "Huh?" say the people who entered the market in the late '90s. &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember having a spirited discussion on this topic with my father in the late 1960s.  I &lt;br /&gt;came home from the University of Chicago filled with the notion that the value of a share &lt;br /&gt;of stock is the present value of its future dividends.  "Baloney," my father said, "no one &lt;br /&gt;buys stocks for the dividends; they buy them for appreciation."  &lt;br /&gt;"But what makes them &lt;br /&gt;appreciate?" I asked.  We never have reached agreement on this matter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think we were both right and both wrong. &lt;br /&gt; Certainly in a real-world sense, people don't &lt;br /&gt;buy stocks for dividends.  Dividends provided a small portion of the total return on stocks &lt;br /&gt;in the 1960s and far less in the 1990s. &lt;br /&gt; Yes, most people buy stocks for appreciation.  But &lt;br /&gt;what causes appreciation?  There has to be an underlying process at work.  We're in &lt;br /&gt;trouble if all we can say is "we buy stocks in the hope they'll go up, and they'll go up &lt;br /&gt;if new buyers are willing to pay more than the last price." &lt;br /&gt; To explain what'll make &lt;br /&gt;the buyers pay more than the last price, we either have to (1) identify what I call an &lt;br /&gt;underlying process or (2) fall back on the bromides listed above that led investors off the &lt;br /&gt;cliff in the 1990s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The "underlying process" has to be related to financial parameters.  By that I mean the &lt;br /&gt;asset values and/or cash flows must be recognized as being worth more than the last price &lt;br /&gt;paid.  That's what causes appreciation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because so few stocks are bought today for asset values, we essentially can disregard &lt;br /&gt;them.  The vast majority of stocks are bought for the stream of earnings the companies &lt;br /&gt;produce. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how do those ea&lt;br /&gt;rnings affect investors – get through to investors – if not in the form &lt;br /&gt;of dividends?  That's the question that drove me in the 1960s.  It almost verges on &lt;br /&gt;metaphysical.  If a company has great earnings but those earnings aren't ever paid out in &lt;br /&gt;dividends, are they still of value to investors?  If it makes a bunch of money but just &lt;br /&gt;hoards it, or reinvests it in new products and facilities that generate future earnings that &lt;br /&gt;also are not paid out, in what way are its profits of value to investors?  &lt;br /&gt;That's kind of like &lt;br /&gt;the old question, "if a tree falls in the forest but there's no one around to hear it, does it &lt;br /&gt;still make noise?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are two possible answers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eventually, earnings must be paid out.  Common sense tells us that, sooner or later, &lt;br /&gt;every company will run out of good reinvestment opportunities, and the cash will then &lt;br /&gt;go to dividends, or to stock buy-backs, which have the same effect but better tax &lt;br /&gt;treatment. &lt;br /&gt; (Of course, the record suggests that when they run out of good &lt;br /&gt;reinvestment opportunities, companies often prefer bad reinvestment opportunities to &lt;br /&gt;giving the money to the shareholders.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alternatively, if cash builds up in a company and its stock doesn't rise to reflect the &lt;br /&gt;buildup but instead languishes "too cheap," someone will bid the stock up in order to &lt;br /&gt;take over the company.  This is economics at work: the value of every asset is the &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;present value of the cash flows it will produce in the future, and eventually the market &lt;br /&gt;will price the asset to reflect that value, because there are ways to reap it. &lt;br /&gt;So What Makes Stocks Worth More? &lt;br /&gt;The equation defining the price of a share of stock is a very simple one: &lt;br /&gt;P = E x P/E &lt;br /&gt;The price of a share of stock is equal to the earnings per share times the ratio of the stock &lt;br /&gt;price to the earnings.  On one hand this explains how prices are set, and on the other hand &lt;br /&gt;it's just tautological: divide both sides of the equation by E and you get P/E = P/E.  Even I &lt;br /&gt;can't argue with that one. &lt;br /&gt;This gives rise to another simple equation: &lt;br /&gt;∆P = ∆E + ∆P/E &lt;br /&gt;Change in pric&lt;br /&gt;e is powered by one or &lt;br /&gt;more of the following factors: &lt;br /&gt;increased earnings eventually are turned into increased dividends,&lt;br /&gt;the undistributed earnings are reinvested to power future earnings growth, and/or&lt;br /&gt;the likely stream of future earnings comes to be viewed as being worth more than the &lt;br /&gt;last price paid, causing an increase in the P/E ratio.&lt;br /&gt;"Growth investors" pursue companies whose earnings are growing the fastest.  As per the &lt;br /&gt;equation, if the P/E ratio holds, earnings growth will be translated directly into stock price &lt;br /&gt;appreciation.  And if there's an increase in investor recognition of the company's growth &lt;br /&gt;potential, the P/E ratio can expand as well, producing appreciation at a rate that exceeds &lt;br /&gt;the rate of earnings growth. &lt;br /&gt;"Value investors," on the other hand, invest primarily in companies where (1) earnings, &lt;br /&gt;while perhaps lacking rapid trendline growth potential, are temporarily depressed and &lt;br /&gt;likely to rebound, and/or (2) the stock's price is unduly low relative to even the low&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;growth earnings, and thus the P/E ratio can be expected to expand. &lt;br /&gt;Any way you slice it, the truth is that changes in a stock's price will be determined &lt;br /&gt;by changes in the earnings per share and changes in the multiple at which investors &lt;br /&gt;value those earnings.  So those who want to predict the movement of a stock's price, or &lt;br /&gt;of the whole market, have to predict those two things.  To get to total return, you simply &lt;br /&gt;add the dividend yield to the rate of price appreciation. &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Outlook for Equity Returns &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, equity returns primarily come from price appreciation.  And the dominant &lt;br /&gt;consideration in long-term appreciation is earnings growth.  &lt;br /&gt;Why do I say "long term &lt;br /&gt;appreciation"?  Because even though P/E ratios jump around much more in the short run &lt;br /&gt;than do earnings, they tend to move within relatively fixed boundaries and, in the long &lt;br /&gt;run, their fluctuations should cancel out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The simple view –&lt;br /&gt; which I tend to take – is that P/E ratios reached ridiculous levels in the &lt;br /&gt;1990s and now, even after significant price declines, still are higher in absolute terms than &lt;br /&gt;they were at many previous market tops.&lt;br /&gt;  Thus, you can assume that P/E ratios will stay &lt;br /&gt;where they are, and thus that earnings growth will translate into parallel price &lt;br /&gt;appreciation.  Or you can assume multiple contraction, in which case appreciation will lag &lt;br /&gt;earnings gains.  But I doubt that a prudent investor can count on P/E ratio expansion as a &lt;br /&gt;source of future stock price appreciation.  Thus, any positive returns will be determined &lt;br /&gt;primarily by the rate of earnings growth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over the years I've quoted Warren Buffett as saying something like "people get into &lt;br /&gt;trouble when they forget that corporate profits tend to grow at 9% a year."  In September I &lt;br /&gt;had a chance to ask him if he actually said that.  "No," he said, "what I said is 'people get &lt;br /&gt;into trouble when they forget that in the long run, stocks won't appreciate faster than the &lt;br /&gt;growth in corporate profits.'"  &lt;br /&gt;Other people spend a lot more time than me studying how &lt;br /&gt;fast corporate profits have grown and will grow.  However, the evidence I'm familiar with &lt;br /&gt;suggests a figure somewhere in mid-single digits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So with dividends minimal and multiples unlikely to expand (at best), normal historic &lt;br /&gt;profit growth seems like a reasonable starting point for equity returns in the long-term &lt;br /&gt;future.  (Of course, extrapolating historic corporate profit growth implies extrapolating &lt;br /&gt;the historic price increases and profit margins.  &lt;br /&gt;Neither of these is assured, but why go &lt;br /&gt;there?)  What I'm left with is trendline price appreciation somewhere in mid-single digits.  &lt;br /&gt;Where in that range, I'll leave to others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adding to Returns Through Active Management &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have written a great deal on the subject of active management (see especially "Safety &lt;br /&gt;First . . . But Where?," April 2001) and have no interest in reiterating.  But I will discuss &lt;br /&gt;the active management industry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An enormous infrastructure has been built up over the last century for the purpose of &lt;br /&gt;beating the stock market.  &lt;br /&gt;Fifty or seventy-five years ago, that sentence would have read," &lt;br /&gt;. . . for the purpose of managing stock market investments."  However, the index fund &lt;br /&gt;industry has grown up in the last thirty years and made it clear that average performance &lt;br /&gt;can be accessed much more cheaply and dependably through passive management than &lt;br /&gt;through active management.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus the raison d'etre of the active managers became &lt;br /&gt;beating the market. &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, the investment management industry invests in analysts, portfolio managers and &lt;br /&gt;traders, not to mention accountants, salespeople and risk managers – plus wood paneling, &lt;br /&gt;oriental rugs and seascapes.  All of this costs money, and the management firms want a &lt;br /&gt;return on their spending.  &lt;br /&gt;So they charge healthy fees.  The people whose money the &lt;br /&gt;firms manage also bear other costs entailed in active management, such as commissions, &lt;br /&gt;market impact, and taxes on short-term gains caused by active trading.  The question is, &lt;br /&gt;"What are &lt;br /&gt;they getting for their money?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is that there has been no documentation that active equity management &lt;br /&gt;consistently provides an edge in the mainstream stock market.  &lt;br /&gt;Some individuals never &lt;br /&gt;beat the market, but even those who do usually see their success limited to brief periods &lt;br /&gt;of time.  &lt;br /&gt;A given strategy works for a while and then stops.  It's usually a matter of being &lt;br /&gt;patient and waiting until your ship comes in.  Very few people are skillful enough to &lt;br /&gt;outperform through thick and thin.  As I've said before, the attention paid to people like &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch is a tribute to their uniqueness and demonstrates the &lt;br /&gt;meaning of the phrase, "it's the exception that proves the rule."  &lt;br /&gt;The rule is that few &lt;br /&gt;people can beat the market for long. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We've already established that equity returns primarily come from appreciation. When &lt;br /&gt;seeking appreciation, you can look fo&lt;br /&gt;r one or more of the following: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt; increases in an asset's intrinsic value (earnings or asset values), &lt;br /&gt;2 movement of the asset's price from a discount toward its intrinsic value (that is, &lt;br /&gt;from undervaluation to fair value), and/or &lt;br /&gt;3 movement of the price from intrinsic value toward a premium (that is, from fair &lt;br /&gt;value to overvaluation). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, superior returns come most dependably from buying things for less &lt;br /&gt;than they're worth and benefiting from the movement of price from discount to fair &lt;br /&gt;value.  &lt;br /&gt;Making money this way doesn't require increases in intrinsic value, which &lt;br /&gt;are uncertain, or the attainment of prices above intrinsic value, which is irrational. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The attractiveness of buying something for less than it's worth makes eminent sense.  &lt;br /&gt;However, doing so requires cooperation from someone who's willing to sell it for less &lt;br /&gt;than it's worth.  It's the SEC's goal to make sure that everyone has the same corporate &lt;br /&gt;information.  &lt;br /&gt;So how is one to find bargains in efficient markets?  You must bring &lt;br /&gt;exceptional analytical ability, insight or foresight.  But because it's exceptional, few &lt;br /&gt;people have it.  &lt;br /&gt;Once in a while someone will find an undervalued stock or guess right &lt;br /&gt;about the direction of the market, but very few people are able to do those things &lt;br /&gt;consistently over time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So What's To Do? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can try harder, but everyone's already trying their hardest.  Or you can ratchet up the &lt;br /&gt;risk level of your portfolio –&lt;br /&gt; counting on the long-run relationship between risk and &lt;br /&gt;return – but once in a while that'll get you killed.  Or you can look for inefficient markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In inefficient markets, not everyone has the same access to information. &lt;br /&gt; I feel bargains &lt;br /&gt;are found most consistently among the things that are not widely known, not understood, &lt;br /&gt;or considered to be risky, complex, unfashionable, controversial, or unseemly.  &lt;br /&gt;When you &lt;br /&gt;combine unequal access to information, uneven ability to analyze that information, and &lt;br /&gt;the effects of negative biases, it's possible for things to sell for less than they're worth.  In &lt;br /&gt;inefficient markets, it's possible for a superior investor to consistently identify those &lt;br /&gt;bargains, and thus to beat the other players consistently. &lt;br /&gt; It's also possible to achieve risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted returns above those available in other market niches.  All it takes is hard work &lt;br /&gt;and superior skill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, it makes sense to assume that since the greatest reward for active management &lt;br /&gt;is found in the inefficient markets (along with incentive fees for the successful managers), &lt;br /&gt;that's also where sharp-eyed specialists will focus their efforts.  (Think of card counting in &lt;br /&gt;blackjack versus betting on the spin of a roulette wheel; where do you think you'll find the &lt;br /&gt;Ph.D.s?) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition, it must be borne in mind that few sectors remain so inefficient that they can &lt;br /&gt;be counted on to provide a free lunch for long.  Over the years, many strategies have been &lt;br /&gt;thought to represent a sure thing, but most fizzled out.  &lt;br /&gt;Computer software stocks, the &lt;br /&gt;nifty-fifty, oil stocks, emerging markets, and most recently tech-media-telecom – all of &lt;br /&gt;these groups have in turn been deified and decimated.  Likewise, a number of investment &lt;br /&gt;techniques have had their day in the sun and then been eclipsed: covered call writing, &lt;br /&gt;portfolio insurance and "market neutral" funds are just a few.  &lt;br /&gt;Nothing can be relied on &lt;br /&gt;for high risk-adjusted returns just because of what it's called.  No investment area &lt;br /&gt;has that birthright.  It's all a matter of the ability to identify bargain-priced &lt;br /&gt;opportunities and implement with skill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line might be that inefficient markets can be the source of superior returns &lt;br /&gt;and can be less heavily populated, but the players there are, on average, more competent.  &lt;br /&gt;Because returns in inefficient markets are more dependent on investors' individual skill &lt;br /&gt;(which is highly variable) than they are on the market's overall return, there'll be a greater &lt;br /&gt;dispersion of results there.  &lt;br /&gt;And that means lesser investors should be expected to &lt;br /&gt;underperform greater investors by a wide margin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sources of Return for Active Managers &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The best way to look at portfolio return (y) is as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;y = α &lt;br /&gt;+ βx &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this simple equation, α is the symbol for alpha, β represents beta, and x is the return of &lt;br /&gt;the market.  Alpha is best thought of as a portfolio manager's differential skill or value &lt;br /&gt;added.  It is the ability to generate performance unrelated to movement of the &lt;br /&gt;market.  Index funds don't aspire to alpha.  &lt;br /&gt;They're managed by people who know they &lt;br /&gt;don't have alpha (actually, most believe no one has any), and they simply strive to reflect &lt;br /&gt;the market's movements –&lt;br /&gt; no better and no worse.  Active managers manage actively &lt;br /&gt;because they think they have alpha.  They charge for it, and they should be able to &lt;br /&gt;demonstrate it.  However, many without it seem to have gotten away with charging for it &lt;br /&gt;over the years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beta is the extent to which a portfolio reflects the return of the market.  A portfolio with a &lt;br /&gt;beta of 1 and no alpha will move up and down exactly as does the market.  &lt;br /&gt;A beta of 2 &lt;br /&gt;means it will move twice as fast in both directions.  &lt;br /&gt;A beta of .5 means it'll move half as &lt;br /&gt;fast.  &lt;br /&gt;A beta of zero means a total lack of correlation – the much sought-after "market &lt;br /&gt;neutral" fund, where all of the return comes from investor skill.  A negative beta means an &lt;br /&gt;inverse correlation (a short position on an index fund is the best example). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believe the alpha/beta model is an excellent way to assess portfolios, portfolio &lt;br /&gt;managers, investment strategies and asset allocation schemes.  It's really an organized &lt;br /&gt;way to think about the question, "how much of the return comes from what the &lt;br /&gt;environment provides, and how much from the manager's value added?"  When one &lt;br /&gt;considers these things, some relevant inquiries are: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Where did the return come from in the past? &lt;br /&gt; Where is the return expected to come from in the future? &lt;br /&gt; How exposed is a given strategy (or my overall portfolio) to market movement or &lt;br /&gt;dependence on claims of alpha?  How much of my future return am I betting on the &lt;br /&gt;direction of the market, &lt;br /&gt;and how much on manager skill? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What assumptions am I willing to make about the outlook for those two things? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A lot is written about the tyranny of benchmarks.  Excessive benchmarking (and an &lt;br /&gt;overemphasis on minimizing tracking error) can force managers to migrate toward &lt;br /&gt;benchmark asset weightings in order to reduce their risk of negative performance &lt;br /&gt;comparisons.  &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, if a manager has real skill, this process can suppress it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, there are very valid roles for benchmarking.  &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the best is in helping to &lt;br /&gt;attribute performance between market impact and the &lt;br /&gt;manager's value added.  In fact, this &lt;br /&gt;can't be done without reference to an effective benchmark. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's obvious that this manager doesn't have any skill: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  10 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  6 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  0 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  -10 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  20 &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither does this manager (he just moves half as much as the benchmark): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  5 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  3 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  0 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  -5 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  10 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or this one (he moves twice as much): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  20 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  12 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  0 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  -20 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  40 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one has a little: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  11 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  8 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  -1 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  -9 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  21 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While this one has a lot: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  12 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  10 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  3 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  2 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  30 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one has a ton, if you can live with the volatility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Period Benchmark Return Portfolio Return &lt;br /&gt;1  10  25 &lt;br /&gt;2  6  20 &lt;br /&gt;3  0  -5 &lt;br /&gt;4  -10  -20 &lt;br /&gt;5  20  25 &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing Alpha &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are people who seem able to make money or beat the market year in and year out.  &lt;br /&gt;It's not certain, however, that they'll manage portfolios long enough to convince the &lt;br /&gt;statisticians that alpha exists and that they have it. &lt;br /&gt; They might make so much money that &lt;br /&gt;they'll stop managing portfolios for others, and thus their performance will cease to be &lt;br /&gt;public.  &lt;br /&gt;Or they might not live long enough for their records to attain statistical &lt;br /&gt;significance.  (At the University of Chicago they told me it takes 64 years to be sure &lt;br /&gt;someone is good rather than lucky; more on this later.)  But I know managers, including &lt;br /&gt;those I work with every day, who I'm convinced can add to return without adding &lt;br /&gt;commensurately to risk – &lt;br /&gt;and in fact while reducing risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do these "alpha managers" do it?  As I described in "The Realist's Creed," the alpha &lt;br /&gt;managers I know come from the "I don't know" school.  They don't expect to know more &lt;br /&gt;than others about the future direction of economies and markets, and thus they eschew &lt;br /&gt;market timing and other forms of macro decision-making. &lt;br /&gt; They just try to gain an edge &lt;br /&gt;by knowing more than others do about micro matters. &lt;br /&gt; As contrarians, they prefer to buy &lt;br /&gt;things that are out of favor.  They invest defensively, thinking more about what they don't &lt;br /&gt;know than about what they do, and worrying more about losing money than about &lt;br /&gt;missing winners.  They build their records on high batting averages and the absence of &lt;br /&gt;losers, rather than on occasional homeruns within a hit-or-miss pattern of returns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most of them are hard working and driven.  &lt;br /&gt;They take their jobs very seriously and think &lt;br /&gt;about their portfolios night and day.  They tend to talk investments with each other, not &lt;br /&gt;football or movies.  Many are "early adapters" who use technology to access diverse &lt;br /&gt;information sources in order to gain a knowledge advantage.  They look for hard asset &lt;br /&gt;values or under-appreciated situations.  They buy with confidence in their analysis, and if &lt;br /&gt;the price of the asset falls, they tend to like it more – and buy rather than sell.  Most &lt;br /&gt;important is that intangible something –&lt;br /&gt; they just "get it" better than others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While going over this list of the characteristics I'd look for in a manager, I want to take a &lt;br /&gt;moment for an essential caveat.  One thing these criteria guarantee is that there'll be times &lt;br /&gt;when investors from the "I don't know" school will look terrible.  In times of euphoria, &lt;br /&gt;qualities like emphasis on value, contrarianism, skepticism and defensiveness are &lt;br /&gt;guaranteed to produce performance that sorely lags the hot sectors and the risk takers.  &lt;br /&gt;This was amply demonstrated in 1998-99, when the best managers I know watched from &lt;br /&gt;the sidelines as others got rich . &lt;br /&gt;. . temporarily.  People who employ alpha managers &lt;br /&gt;might feel pangs of regret over what they pass up in boom times, but they should know &lt;br /&gt;the route to performance they've chosen is far more reliable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, managers with alpha, once identified, can be depended on to a much greater &lt;br /&gt;extent than those whose returns are generated primarily by market movements.  &lt;br /&gt;Having &lt;br /&gt;said that, however, I don't want to appear to underestimate the difficulty of finding &lt;br /&gt;managers with alpha. &lt;br /&gt; I've been on the receiving end of many presentations from &lt;br /&gt;managers pursuing foundation business, and I can certify that it's not easy to distinguish &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who sound good and are from those who sound good but aren't.  (People who don't &lt;br /&gt;sound good usually aren't allowed out to make presentations.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Certainly the search for alpha managers is a tough one.  &lt;br /&gt;Not only is it hard to know which &lt;br /&gt;managers have it, but: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The search for them will be littered with mistakes and losses. &lt;br /&gt; Good managers are likely to close their funds before their limits are exceeded. &lt;br /&gt; Managers talented enough to exploit inefficiencies will be able to appropriate a fair &lt;br /&gt;bit of the excess return for themselves in the form of fees. &lt;br /&gt; The limited size of inefficient markets and the limited capacity of the managers &lt;br /&gt;probably mean very large investment pools can't expect to invest enough with alpha &lt;br /&gt;managers to greatly affect their results.  And their attempts to pump in large amounts &lt;br /&gt;of capital can ruin the opportunity for everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There certainly are stumbling blocks in the search for alpha managers, but it's worth &lt;br /&gt;trying.  If you aren't satisfied with doing average in efficient markets, what else is there?  &lt;br /&gt;Invest with managers who claim they know what the future holds and can otherwise out-&lt;br /&gt;invest everyone else in the same mainstream stocks?  I doubt that's the way.  &lt;br /&gt;To &lt;br /&gt;paraphrase Professor James Lorie of the University of Chicago (circa 1970), I'd rather &lt;br /&gt;"index the core of a portfolio and manage the heck out of the periphery" –&lt;br /&gt; hopefully with &lt;br /&gt;help from managers with alpha. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Role of Luck &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To end this memo on returns, I want to spend a few pages discussing the part played by &lt;br /&gt;randomness (or luck or chance).  A new book on this subject is being &lt;br /&gt;passed around the &lt;br /&gt;alpha manager world more than Playboy was passed around when I was in the ninth &lt;br /&gt;grade.  It's "Fooled By Randomness" by Nassim Taleb, a Ph. D. hedge fund manager and &lt;br /&gt;self-described aesthete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My "Realist's Creed" list of required ingredients for intelligent investing started with &lt;br /&gt;membership in the "I don't know" school; progressed through contrarianism, humility and &lt;br /&gt;skepticism; and ended with awareness of prevailing investor psychology.  Taleb's book &lt;br /&gt;reminded me of one other essential: being conscious of the role of luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book can be difficult to read.  Here are just two examples: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Popper believed that any idea of Utopia is necessarily closed in the fact that it &lt;br /&gt;chokes its own refutations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . to be technical, these "randomizations" are frequently done during &lt;br /&gt;optimization problems, when one needs to perturbate a function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I found its contents profound.  In "Investment Miscellany" I discussed an &lt;br /&gt;article by Richard Bookstaber of Moore Capital and stated that, "What smart people do is &lt;br /&gt;put into logical words the thoughts we may have had but never formulated or expressed." &lt;br /&gt;Taleb is such an individual.  &lt;br /&gt;As I did with Bookstaber's article, I will attempt below to &lt;br /&gt;communicate and explain some of his salient points, supported by excerpts from the &lt;br /&gt;book. &lt;br /&gt;Randomness (or luck) plays a huge part in life's results, and outcomes that hinge on &lt;br /&gt;random events should be viewed as different from those that do not. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, when considering whether an investment record is likely to be repeated, it is &lt;br /&gt;essential to think about the role of randomness in the manager's results, and whether &lt;br /&gt;the performance resulted from skill or simply being lucky. &lt;br /&gt;$10 million earned through Russian roulette does not have the same value as $10 &lt;br /&gt;million earned through the diligent and artful practice of dentistry.  &lt;br /&gt;They are the &lt;br /&gt;same, can buy the same goods, except that one's dependence on randomness is &lt;br /&gt;greater than the other.  To your accountant, though, they would be identical. . &lt;br /&gt;. . &lt;br /&gt;Yet, deep down, I cannot help but consider them as qualitatively different.  (p. 28) &lt;br /&gt;Every rec&lt;br /&gt;ord should be considered in light of the other outcomes – &lt;br /&gt;Taleb calls them &lt;br /&gt;"alternative histories" –&lt;br /&gt; that could have occurred just as easily as the "visible &lt;br /&gt;histories" that did. &lt;br /&gt;Clearly my way of judging matters is probabilistic in nature; it relies on the notion &lt;br /&gt;of what could have probably happened.  (p.29) &lt;br /&gt;If we have heard of [history's great generals and inventors], it is simply because &lt;br /&gt;they took considerable risks, along with thousands of others, and happened to win. &lt;br /&gt;They were intelligent, courageous, noble (at times), had the highest possible &lt;br /&gt;obtainable culture in their day –&lt;br /&gt; but so did thousands of others who live in the &lt;br /&gt;musty footnotes of history.  (p. 35) &lt;br /&gt;Think about the aggressive backgammon player who can't win without a roll of double &lt;br /&gt;sixes.  He accepts the cube – doubling the stakes – and then gets his "boxcars."  It might &lt;br /&gt;have been an unwise bet, with its one-in-36 chance of success, but because it succeeded, &lt;br /&gt;everybody considers him brilliant.  We should think about how probable it was that &lt;br /&gt;something other than double sixes would materialize, and thus how lucky the player was &lt;br /&gt;to have won.  This says a lot about his likelihood of winning aga&lt;br /&gt;in. &lt;br /&gt;As my friend Bruce Newberg says over our backgammon games, "there are probabilities, &lt;br /&gt;and then there are outcomes."  The fact that something's improbable doesn't mean it &lt;br /&gt;won't happen.  And the fact that something happened doesn't mean it wasn't &lt;br /&gt;improbable.  (I can't stress this essential point enough.)  Every once in a while, &lt;br /&gt;someone makes a risky bet on an improbable or uncertain outcome and ends up &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looking like a genius.  But we should recognize that it happened because of luck and &lt;br /&gt;boldness, not skill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the short run, a great deal of investment success can result from just being in the right &lt;br /&gt;place at the right time.  I always say the keys to profit are aggressiveness, timing and &lt;br /&gt;skill, and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don't need that much &lt;br /&gt;skill.  &lt;br /&gt;My image is of a blindfolded dart thrower.  He heaves it wildly just as someone &lt;br /&gt;knocks over the target.  His dart finds the bulls-eye and he's proclaimed the champ. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . at a given time in the markets, the most profitable traders are likely to be those &lt;br /&gt;that are best fit &lt;br /&gt;to the latest cycle.  This does not happen too often with dentists or &lt;br /&gt;pianists – because of the nature of randomness.  (p.74) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The easy way to see this is that in boom times, the highest returns often go to those who &lt;br /&gt;take the most risk.  That doesn't say anything about their being the best investors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett's appendix to the fourth revised edition of "The Intelligent Investor" &lt;br /&gt;describes a contest in which each of the 225 million Americans starts with $1 and flips a &lt;br /&gt;coin once a day.  The people who get it right on day one collect a dollar from those who &lt;br /&gt;were wrong and go on to flip again on day two, and so forth.  Ten days later, 220,000 &lt;br /&gt;people have called it right ten times in a row and won $1,000.  "They may try to be &lt;br /&gt;modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the &lt;br /&gt;opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field &lt;br /&gt;of flipping."  After another ten days, we're down to 215 survivors who've been right 20 &lt;br /&gt;times in a row and have &lt;br /&gt;won $1 million.  They write books on "How I Turned a Dollar &lt;br /&gt;into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning" and sell tickets to &lt;br /&gt;seminars.  Sound familiar? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus randomness contributes to (or wrecks) investment records to a degree that few &lt;br /&gt;people appreciate fully.  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, the dangers that lurk in thus-far-successful &lt;br /&gt;strategies often are under-rated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet &lt;br /&gt;rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of &lt;br /&gt;chambers instead of six.  After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence &lt;br /&gt;of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. . . .  Second, unlike a well-&lt;br /&gt;defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the &lt;br /&gt;risks are visible to anyone &lt;br /&gt;capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of &lt;br /&gt;reality.&lt;br /&gt; . . .  One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette – and &lt;br /&gt;calling it by some alternative "low risk" name.  (p. 28) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a good way to sum up Taleb's views is by excerpting from a table found on page 3 &lt;br /&gt;of his book.  He lists in the first column a number of things that easily can be mistaken for &lt;br /&gt;the things in the second &lt;br /&gt;column. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luck Skill &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness Determinism &lt;br /&gt;Probability Certainty &lt;br /&gt;Belief, conjecture Knowledge, certitude &lt;br /&gt;Theory Reality &lt;br /&gt;Anecdote, coincidence Causality, law &lt;br /&gt;Survivorship bias Market outperformance &lt;br /&gt;Lucky idiot Skilled investor &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The table reminds me of a key difference between the "I know" and "I don't know" &lt;br /&gt;schools.  "I don't know" investors are acutely conscious of the things in the first column; &lt;br /&gt;"I know" investors routinely mi&lt;br /&gt;stake them for things in the second. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think Taleb's dichotomization is sheer brilliance.  We all know that when things go &lt;br /&gt;right, luck looks like skill.  Coincidence looks like causality.  A "lucky idiot" looks &lt;br /&gt;like a skilled investor. &lt;br /&gt; Of course, knowing that randomness can have this effect doesn't &lt;br /&gt;make it easy to distinguish between lucky investors and skillful investors.  But we must &lt;br /&gt;keep trying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find that I agree with essentially all of Taleb's important points. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Investors are right (and wrong) all the time for the "wrong reason."  Someone &lt;br /&gt;buys a stock because he expects a certain development; it doesn't occur; the market &lt;br /&gt;takes the stock up anyway; he looks good (and invariably accepts credit). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The correctness of a decision can't be judged from the outcome.  Nevertheless, &lt;br /&gt;that's how people assess them.  A good decision is one that's optimal at the time it's &lt;br /&gt;made, when the future is by definition unknown.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus correct decisions are often &lt;br /&gt;unsuccessful, and vice versa. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Randomness alone can produce just about any outcome in the short run.  The &lt;br /&gt;effect of random events is analogous to the contribution from beta discussed on page &lt;br /&gt;six. &lt;br /&gt; In portfolios that are allowed to reflect them fully, market movements can easily &lt;br /&gt;swamp the skillfulness of the manager (or lack thereof).  But certainly market &lt;br /&gt;movements cannot be credited to the manager (unless he's the rare timer who's &lt;br /&gt;capable of getting it right repeatedly). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For these reasons, investors often receive credit they don't deserve.  One good &lt;br /&gt;coup can be enough to build a reputation, but clearly a coup can arise out of &lt;br /&gt;randomness alone.  Few of these "geniuses" are right more than once or twice in a &lt;br /&gt;row. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thus it's essential to have a large number of observations – lots of years of data – &lt;br /&gt;before judging a given manager's ability. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;br /&gt;         *          * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity returns should be expected to average in single digits at best for the next few &lt;br /&gt;years.  This is because dividends will be moderate and P/E ratio expansion can't be &lt;br /&gt;counted on. &lt;br /&gt;Most investors are unlikel&lt;br /&gt;y to find this market return satisfactory, and thus they will &lt;br /&gt;continue to try for more through active management.  However, because of the great deal &lt;br /&gt;of attention paid to them, most mainstream markets are efficient.  &lt;br /&gt;This means very few &lt;br /&gt;investors there will dependably achieve superior risk-adjusted returns or consistently beat &lt;br /&gt;the other market participants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be able to earn better risk-adjusted returns and beat the market and the competition, &lt;br /&gt;one had better look in less thoroughly explored, inefficient markets.  &lt;br /&gt;Even there, &lt;br /&gt;however, it's essential that one be, or employ, a superior manager possessing "alpha." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's hard to separate good managers from not-so-good managers, and to do so it's &lt;br /&gt;essential that we identify returns earned through genuine, repeatable skill, not just &lt;br /&gt;good fortune. &lt;br /&gt; In that regard, records that have been rendered above average by &lt;br /&gt;occasional flashes of greatness tell us much less than records that consistently have &lt;br /&gt;been even modestly superior over long periods of time, and those that demonstrate a &lt;br /&gt;dependable ability to &lt;br /&gt;avoid losses in tough markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;November 11, 2002 &lt;br /&gt;2002 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: What’s Your Game Plan? &lt;br /&gt;As the summer ends, my thoughts turn to the tennis game I’ve been hoping to improve, &lt;br /&gt;the baseball season that’s moving toward a conclusion, and the football season that’s just &lt;br /&gt;getting started.  It’s enough to remind m&lt;br /&gt;e of the role sports play in our lives . . . and in &lt;br /&gt;our thoughts about investing. &lt;br /&gt;UHow Oaktree Plays the Game &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I feel I should apologize for the frequency with which I use sports metaphors &lt;br /&gt;to express my views on investing.  And I worry that they’ll fall flat in Europe and Asia.  &lt;br /&gt;But that doesn’t seem to stop me. &lt;br /&gt;“The key to investment success isn’t hitting home runs; it’s avoiding strikeouts and &lt;br /&gt;inning-ending double plays.”  I say this over and over . . . and over . . . as you’ve no &lt;br /&gt;doubt experienced. But I truly believe it. &lt;br /&gt;Investing is a testosterone-laden world where too many people think about how good &lt;br /&gt;they are and how much they’ll make if they swing for the fences and connect.  Ask some &lt;br /&gt;I-know-school investors to tell you what makes them good, and you’ll hear a lot about&lt;br /&gt;home runs they’ve hit in the past and the home runs-in-the-making that reside in their&lt;br /&gt;current portfolio.  How many talk about consistency, or the fact that their worst year&lt;br /&gt;wasn’t too bad?&lt;br /&gt;One of the most striking things I’ve noted over the last 35 years is how brief most &lt;br /&gt;outstanding investment careers are.  Not as short as the careers of professional athletes, &lt;br /&gt;but shorter than they should be in a physically non-destructive vocation. &lt;br /&gt;Where are the leading competitor&lt;br /&gt;s from the days when I first managed high yield bonds &lt;br /&gt;25 or 20 years ago?  Almost none of them are around anymore.  And astoundingly, not &lt;br /&gt;one of our prominent distressed debt competitors from the early days 15 or even 10 years &lt;br /&gt;ago remains a leader today. &lt;br /&gt;Where’d they go?  Many disappeared because org&lt;br /&gt;anizational flaws rendered their game &lt;br /&gt;plans unsustainable.  And the rest are gone because they swung for the fences but struck &lt;br /&gt;out instead. &lt;br /&gt;That brings up something that I consider a great paradox:  I don’t think many investment &lt;br /&gt;managers’ careers end because they fail to hit home runs.  Rather, they end up out o&lt;br /&gt;f the &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;game because they strike out too often – not because they don’t have enough &lt;br /&gt;winners, but because they have too many losers.  And yet, lots of managers keep &lt;br /&gt;swinging for the fences. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They bet too much when they think they have a winning idea or a correct view of the &lt;br /&gt;future, concentrating their portfolios rather than diversifying. &lt;br /&gt; They incur excessive transaction costs by changing their holdings too often or &lt;br /&gt;attempting to time the market. &lt;br /&gt; And they position their portfolios for favorable scenarios and hoped-for outcomes, &lt;br /&gt;rather than ensuring that they’ll be able to survive the inevitable miscalculation or &lt;br /&gt;stroke of bad luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At Oaktree, on the other hand, we believe firmly that “if we avoid the losers, the &lt;br /&gt;winners will take care of themselves.”  That’s been our motto since the beginning, and &lt;br /&gt;it always will be.  We go for batting average, not home runs.  We know others will get &lt;br /&gt;the headlines for their big victories and spectacular seasons.  But we expect to be around &lt;br /&gt;at the finish because of consistent good performance that produces satisfied clients. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UFor Me, It Started With Tennis &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In July, Larry Keele and I met with the Directors of the Vanguard Convertible Securities &lt;br /&gt;Fund to report on Oaktree’s performance as the fund’s manager.  I was extremely pleased &lt;br /&gt;to see Charles Ellis of Greenwich Associates, one of the great thinkers in the investment &lt;br /&gt;field, whom I hadn’t come across in many years.  I was especially pleased to have a &lt;br /&gt;chance to tell him about the seminal part his 1975 article, “The Loser’s Game,” had &lt;br /&gt;played in the development of my thinking.  The article employed a metaphor that was &lt;br /&gt;simple but profound. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charley’s article described the perceptive analysis of tennis contained in “Extraordinary &lt;br /&gt;Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player” by Dr. Simon Ramo, the “R” in TRW.  Ramo &lt;br /&gt;pointed out that professional tennis is a “winner’s game,” in which the match goes to the &lt;br /&gt;player who’s able to hit the most winners: fast-paced, well-placed shots that his opponent &lt;br /&gt;can’t return.  But the tennis the rest of us play is a “loser’s game,” with the match going &lt;br /&gt;to the player who hits the fewest losers.  The winner just keeps the ball in play until the &lt;br /&gt;loser hits it into the net or off the court.  In other words, in amateur tennis, points &lt;br /&gt;aren’t won; they’re lost.  I recognized in Ramo’s loss-avoidance strategy the version of &lt;br /&gt;tennis I try to play. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charley took Ramo’s idea a step further, applying it to investments.  His views on market &lt;br /&gt;efficiency and the high cost of trading led him to conclude that the pursuit of winners is &lt;br /&gt;unlikely to pay off. Instead, you should try to avoid hitting losers.  I found this view of &lt;br /&gt;investing absolutely compelling.  I can’t remember saying, “Eureka; that’s the approach &lt;br /&gt;for me,” but the developments over the last three decades certainly suggest his article was &lt;br /&gt;an important source of my inspiration. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his conviction that markets are efficient, Charley recommended passive &lt;br /&gt;investing as the best way to end up the winner – let others try the tough shots and fail.  &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree’s view is a little different.  Although we believe in the existence of inefficient &lt;br /&gt;markets as well as efficient ones, we still view the avoidance of losers as a wonderful &lt;br /&gt;foundation for investment success.  Thus we diversify our portfolios, limit the &lt;br /&gt;fundamental risk we’ll take, try to buy things that provide downside protection, and &lt;br /&gt;emphasize senior securities.  We, too, try to win by not losing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhich Team Do You Want Out There? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recently came up with a new sports metaphor that handily illustrates a crucial choice &lt;br /&gt;each investor has to make.  It goes like this: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Think about a football game.  The offense has the ball.  They have four tries to make ten &lt;br /&gt;yards. If they don’t, the referee blows the whistle.  Off the field goes the offense and on &lt;br /&gt;comes the defense, whose job it is to stop the other team from advancing the ball. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is football a good metaphor for your view of investing?  Well I’ll tell you, it isn’t for &lt;br /&gt;mine.  In investing there’s no one there to blow the whistle; you rarely know when to &lt;br /&gt;switch from offense to defense; and there aren’t any time-outs during which to do it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, I think investing is more like the “football” that’s played outside the U.S. – soccer.  &lt;br /&gt;In soccer, the same eleven players are on the field for essentially the whole game.  There &lt;br /&gt;isn’t an offensive squad and a defensive squad.  The same people have to play both ways &lt;br /&gt;. . . have to be able to deal with all eventualities.  Collectively, those eleven players must &lt;br /&gt;have the potential to score goals and stop the opposition from scoring more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A soccer coach has to decide whether to field a team that emphasizes offense (in order to &lt;br /&gt;score a lot of goals and somehow hold the other team to fewer) or defense (hoping to shut &lt;br /&gt;out the other team and find the net once), or one that’s balanced.  Because the coach &lt;br /&gt;knows he won’t have many opportunities to switch between offensive and defensive &lt;br /&gt;personnel during the game, he has to come up with a winning lineup and stick with &lt;br /&gt;it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s my view of investing.  Few people (if any) have the ability to switch tactics to &lt;br /&gt;match market conditions on a timely basis.  So investors should commit to an approach – &lt;br /&gt;hopefully one that will serve them through a variety of scenarios.  They can be &lt;br /&gt;aggressive, hoping they’ll make a lot on the winners and not give it back on the losers.  &lt;br /&gt;They can emphasize defense, hoping to keep up in good times and excel in bad times.  Or &lt;br /&gt;they can attempt to balance offense and defense, giving up on tactical timing but aiming &lt;br /&gt;to win through superior security selection in both up and down markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree’s preference for defense is clear.  In good times, we feel it’s okay if we just keep &lt;br /&gt;up with the indices (and in the best of times we may even lag a bit).  But even average &lt;br /&gt;investors make a lot of money in good times, and I doubt many managers get fired for &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being average in up markets.  Oaktree portfolios are set up to outperform in bad times, &lt;br /&gt;and that’s when we think outperformance is essential.  Clearly, if we can keep up in good &lt;br /&gt;times and outperform in bad times, we’ll have above average results over full cycles with &lt;br /&gt;below average volatility, and our clients will enjoy outperformance when others are &lt;br /&gt;suffering.  We think that’s a winning long-term combination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our game plan is built around defense.  But that’s not enough.  We still need players with &lt;br /&gt;superior skills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UFinding Your Role Model &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An article in the Wall Street Journal of August 8, entitled “Greatness in Our Midst,” &lt;br /&gt;supplied the immediate impetus for this memo.  It attempted to determine “who’s the &lt;br /&gt;greatest living baseball player?”  I’m no expert on baseball, but I liked the Journal’s &lt;br /&gt;analytical approach and loved its conclusions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of the five players discussed, Barry Bonds came in fifth.  “If you’re looking for a peak-&lt;br /&gt;value player – a guy to play one season as well as anyone ever has – this is your guy.  His &lt;br /&gt;past two campaigns have been other-worldly . . .”  Bonds has a ton of ability, but he has &lt;br /&gt;yet to prove that he’s “the greatest.”  Lots of fence-swinging investors have had &lt;br /&gt;otherworldly years, but few have completed outstanding careers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stan Musial placed fourth: outstanding at the plate, but below average on defense &lt;br /&gt;according to the Journal.  It’s tough to be the best without strong defense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The #3 pick was Willie Mays.  He ended his career with excellent stats in many offensive &lt;br /&gt;categories and he was an outstanding fielder, having made what has to be the most &lt;br /&gt;famous catch in baseball history.  Surprisingly, however, “in a career full of &lt;br /&gt;milestones, such as 3,000 hits and 600 homers, Mr. Mays doesn’t own a single &lt;br /&gt;significant major-league record.”  Records aren’t what it’s about; I think its &lt;br /&gt;competence, consistency, and an absence of weaknesses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the way Ricky Henderson made it to runner-up.  “Walks aren’t sexy and steals &lt;br /&gt;aren’t trendy,” but Henderson holds the career record in both, and they positioned him to &lt;br /&gt;score.  “And no one’s done this more often than Mr. Henderson.”  It’s kind of like being &lt;br /&gt;a steady performer in an unfashionable niche like convertibles, underdeveloped real &lt;br /&gt;estate or power infrastructure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Journal’s pick for greatest living player: Henry Aaron.  Unlike Willie Mays, the &lt;br /&gt;Journal says, “Hammerin’ Hank holds more important records than any player in history: &lt;br /&gt;home runs, runs batted in, total bases, extra-base hits and Aggregate Bases,” (which it &lt;br /&gt;defines as the sum of hits, extra bases, walks and steals).  And I love the way he did it: &lt;br /&gt;“Mr. Aaron’s best seasons don’t compare with those of Messrs. Bonds, Mays or &lt;br /&gt;Musial, but he played at a high level longer than any player in the history of the &lt;br /&gt;game.”  In my book, that’s the definition of #1. &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people, in any field, can hope to have talents and abilities like these men.  But each &lt;br /&gt;of us can try to apply the same work ethic, and we can select our role models and &lt;br /&gt;decide how to conduct ourselves professionally.  I want an Oaktree that’s like Willie &lt;br /&gt;and Hank.  An exceptional career, even if it doesn’t result in entries in the record &lt;br /&gt;books.  Or a number of records, but for a lifetime, not a single great year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Steady Eddie” Murray was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame just six weeks ago.  &lt;br /&gt;He drove in at least 75 runs a year for a major league-record 20 consecutive seasons.  &lt;br /&gt;I’d like Oaktree’s play to be described as “Steady Eddie.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sandy Koufax was pretty steady, too.  In the six years 1961-66, he was named an All-Star &lt;br /&gt;six times and led the league in earned run average five times, in strikeouts per inning five &lt;br /&gt;times, in hits allowed per inning five times, in hits and walks allowed per inning four &lt;br /&gt;times, in shutouts three times, in innings pitched twice, in won-lost percentage twice, and &lt;br /&gt;in complete games twice.  He pitched a no-hit game every year from 1962 to 1965, and &lt;br /&gt;the last of those was a perfect game.  Over that period, he essentially had no weaknesses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, of course, I can’t fail to mention Cal Ripken, Jr.  He played all of his 21 seasons &lt;br /&gt;with the Orioles, a great oddity in a time when there’s little constancy.  And speaking of &lt;br /&gt;constancy, Cal is well known for his record of playing in 2,632 consecutive games, &lt;br /&gt;spanning a 15-year period.  He also played 8,243 innings without missing one.  Always &lt;br /&gt;there for his teammates and fans, he was chosen to start at shortstop in 17 consecutive &lt;br /&gt;All-Star games. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are my baseball heroes.  They personify my aspirations for Oaktree. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UPlaying Within Yourself &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An expression from the broadcasting booth that’s relevant to investing relates to the need &lt;br /&gt;to avoid pushing too hard.  “Playing within yourself,” they call it.  It means not trying to &lt;br /&gt;do things you’re not capable of, or things that can’t be accomplished within the &lt;br /&gt;environment as it exists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the defenders drop back to cover the deep receivers, the intelligent quarterback &lt;br /&gt;throws short passes until they move up.  That opens up the downfield routes, enabling &lt;br /&gt;him to complete the long bomb.  “He’s taking what they give him,” the commentators &lt;br /&gt;say, approvingly.  It’s what we all must remember to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We simply cannot create investment opportunities when they’re not there.  In its first &lt;br /&gt;year, our newest distressed debt fund produced a 64% net IRR that’s eye-popping . . . and &lt;br /&gt;impossible to replicate any time soon.  So what should we do now? Rather than take &lt;br /&gt;profits and distribute the proceeds, should we prolong our holding periods or try to repeat &lt;br /&gt;our gains in new positions?  And would it be smart to raise a big new fund? None of &lt;br /&gt;these, if the prospective returns on our holdings are inadequate and new investment &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opportunities are limited. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The dumbest thing we could do is to insist on perpetuating our high returns – and give &lt;br /&gt;back our profits in the process. If it’s not there, hoping won’t make it so.  All we ever &lt;br /&gt;can do is take what they give us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhat’s Better, Investing or Sports? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When people ask me what I like so much about investing, I usually go to the well for &lt;br /&gt;more comparisons to sports. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It’s competitive – some succeed and some fail, and the distinction is clear. &lt;br /&gt; It’s quantitative – you can see the results in black and white. &lt;br /&gt; It’s a meritocracy – in the long term, the better returns go to the superior investors. &lt;br /&gt; It’s team-oriented – an effective group can accomplish more than one person. &lt;br /&gt; It’s satisfying and enjoyable – but much more so when you win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many of the things that make sports fun to watch and participate in are the same things &lt;br /&gt;that make investing a great area in which to work.  However, Warren Buffett came up &lt;br /&gt;with one way in which the investor has it better than the athlete. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Berkshire Hathaway’s 1997 Annual Report, Buffett talked about Ted Williams – the &lt;br /&gt;“Splendid Splinter” – one of the greatest hitters in history.  A factor that contributed to &lt;br /&gt;his success was his intensive study of his own game.  By breaking down the strike zone &lt;br /&gt;into 77 baseball-sized “cells” and charting his results at the plate, he learned that his &lt;br /&gt;batting average was much better when he only went after pitches in his “sweet spot.”  Of &lt;br /&gt;course, even with that knowledge, he couldn’t wait all day for the perfect pitch; if he let &lt;br /&gt;three strikes go by without swinging, he’d be called out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Way back in the November 1, 1974, issue of Forbes, Buffett pointed out that investors &lt;br /&gt;have an advantage in that regard, if they’ll just take advantage of it.  Because they can’t &lt;br /&gt;strike out looking, investors needn’t feel pressured to act.  They can pass up lots of &lt;br /&gt;opportunities until they see one that’s terrific. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investing is the greatest business in the world because you never have to swing.  &lt;br /&gt;You stand at the plate; the pitcher throws you General Motors at 47!  U.S. Steel at &lt;br /&gt;39!  And nobody calls a strike on you.  There’s no penalty except opportunity.  &lt;br /&gt;All day you wait for the pitch you like; then, when the fielders are asleep, you &lt;br /&gt;step up and hit it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buffett’s approach, like that of Williams, rewards patience, selectivity and a &lt;br /&gt;superior understanding of the underlying process.  These are some of the things &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree likes to emphasize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBack to Tennis for the Wrap-up &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as this memo was going into the home stretch, the Wall Street Journal’s Allan Barra &lt;br /&gt;greeted the start of the U.S. Open tennis tournament with an article about Pete Sampras.  &lt;br /&gt;For me, it provided the ultimate investment/sports metaphor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Sampras will need no future historians to make his case as the greatest tennis &lt;br /&gt;player of our time.  His career credentials – the 14 Grand Slam singles &lt;br /&gt;championships; the 63-7 record in Wimbledon and seven Wimbledon titles in &lt;br /&gt;eight years; the 71-9 record at the U.S.  Open with 87 consecutive service games &lt;br /&gt;won there; the six straight seasons of being ranked No. 1 – do that admirably. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . Sampras the player wasn’t always exciting.  Mr. Sampras’s outstanding &lt;br /&gt;quality was always his uncanny consistency.  Was there an athlete of the past 10 &lt;br /&gt;to 12 years whose greatness has been harder to capture in highlights?  His &lt;br /&gt;highlights were hard to distinguish from his lowlights.  As I wrote in the Wall &lt;br /&gt;Street Journal a few years ago: “The definitive book on the man would have to be &lt;br /&gt;titled ‘Pete Sampras: The Dullness of Excellence.’  But who would buy it?”  &lt;br /&gt;(August 26, 2003; emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sentence I’ve bolded struck me as particularly thought provoking.  You could read it &lt;br /&gt;as saying “his best moments weren’t much better than his worst moments” – not a very &lt;br /&gt;stirring thought.  Alternatively, you could read it as “his worst moments were almost &lt;br /&gt;as good as his best.”  In my view, that would describe a terrific money management &lt;br /&gt;career. We hope people will say it about Oaktree. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*     *     * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m always careful to point out that there are many game plans capable of leading to &lt;br /&gt;success.  Offense or defense.  Home runs or batting average.  Go for the long bomb, or &lt;br /&gt;pick them apart with short passes.  Battle from the baseline or rush the net.  There are as &lt;br /&gt;many choices as there are sports metaphors.  But the best game plan will only take you as &lt;br /&gt;far as the starting line or the first pitch.  Once the game is underway, it comes down to &lt;br /&gt;skillful execution.  The best strategy in the world won’t pay off without skillful &lt;br /&gt;blocking and tackling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And having a talented, disciplined team that stays together – a rarity in sports or &lt;br /&gt;investing – doesn’t hurt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;September 5, 2003 &lt;br /&gt;2003 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:     Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks&lt;br /&gt;Re: Us and Them  &lt;br /&gt;As a kid, I – and probably you – viewed the world in simple terms.  There were good guys and &lt;br /&gt;bad guys.  Americans and commies.  Cops and robbers.  Settlers and redcoats.  The Dodgers I &lt;br /&gt;cheered for and the Yankees who always won.  Over time my view of the investment &lt;br /&gt;community has settled into an equally clear distinction: us and them.   &lt;br /&gt;You’ve heard a lot from me about the difference between the “I know” school and the “I don’t &lt;br /&gt;know” school, concepts I introduced in “What’s It All About, Alpha?” (July 2001) and &lt;br /&gt;elaborated on in “The Realist’s Creed” (May 2002).  In the last few years it has b&lt;br /&gt;ecome clear to &lt;br /&gt;me that “we” don’t differ from “them” just in terms of how much we think we know about the &lt;br /&gt;future, but in many other ways as well.   &lt;br /&gt;UDo You Know or Don’t You? &lt;br /&gt;Most of the investors I’ve met over the years have belonged to the “I know” school.  This was &lt;br /&gt;particularly true in 1968-78, when I analyzed equities, and even in 1978-95, when I had &lt;br /&gt;switched to non-mainstream investments but still worked at equity-centric money management &lt;br /&gt;firms. &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to identify members of the “I know” school: &lt;br /&gt;They think knowledge of the future direction of economies, interest rates, markets and&lt;br /&gt;widely followed mainstream stocks is essential for investment success.&lt;br /&gt;They’re confident it can be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;They know they can do it.&lt;br /&gt;They’re aware that lots of other people are trying to do it too, but they figure either (a)&lt;br /&gt;everyone can be successful at the same time, or (b) only a few can be, but they’re among&lt;br /&gt;them.&lt;br /&gt;They’re comfortable investing based on their opinions regarding the future.&lt;br /&gt;They’re also glad to share their views with others, even though correct forecasts should be&lt;br /&gt;of such great value that no one would give them away gratis.&lt;br /&gt;They rarely look back to rigorously assess their record as forecasters.&lt;br /&gt;“Confident” is the key word for describing members of this school.  For the “I don’t know” &lt;br /&gt;school, on the other hand, the word – especially when dealing with the macro-future – is &lt;br /&gt;“guarded.”  Its adherents generally&lt;br /&gt; believe you can’t know the future; you don’t have to &lt;br /&gt;know the future; and the proper goal is to do the best possible job of investing in the &lt;br /&gt;absence of that knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UThe Benefits of Membership &lt;br /&gt;As a member of the “I know” school, you get to opine on the future (and maybe have people &lt;br /&gt;take notes).   You may be sought out for your opinions and considered a desirable dinner guest  &lt;br /&gt;. . . especially when the stock market’s going up.   &lt;br /&gt;Join the “I don’t know” school and the results are more mixed.  You’ll soon tire of saying “I &lt;br /&gt;don’t know” to friends and strangers alike.  After a while, even relatives will stop asking where &lt;br /&gt;you think the market’s going.  You’ll never get to enjoy that 1-in-1,000 moment when your &lt;br /&gt;forecast comes true and the Wall Street Journal runs your picture.  On the other hand, you’ll be &lt;br /&gt;spared all those times when forecasts miss the mark, as well as the losses that can result from &lt;br /&gt;investing based on over-rated knowledge of the future.  But how do you think it feels to have &lt;br /&gt;prospective clients ask about your investment outlook and have to say, “I have no idea”?   &lt;br /&gt;For me, the bottom line on which school is best comes from the late Stanford behaviorist, Amos &lt;br /&gt;Tversky:  “It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more &lt;br /&gt;frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they &lt;br /&gt;know exactly what’s going on.” &lt;br /&gt;0BU“A group of related or coincident things, events, actions, etc.” &lt;br /&gt;Random House’s secondary definition for the word “syndrome,” shown above, suggests a set of &lt;br /&gt;elements that can be viewed separately but take on greater meaning when considered together.  &lt;br /&gt;And the more I think about it, the more I se&lt;br /&gt;e su  ch a pattern in the contrasting styles of &lt;br /&gt;investment industry participants. &lt;br /&gt;Investors don’t just differ in regard to their views on foreknowledge, but in terms of a large &lt;br /&gt;number of elements.  And the pattern among those elements seems to be consistent – correlated &lt;br /&gt;– not random.  Ask yourself, for example, whether the “I don’t know” school is evenly divided&lt;br /&gt;between bulls and bears.  Maybe, but in my experience, members of the “I don’t know” school&lt;br /&gt;tend to trust less in the market than those of the “I know” school.  That’s an example of the&lt;br /&gt;pattern, or syndrome, that I think investors tend to demonstrate in many regards.&lt;br /&gt;In my memo “Returns and How They Get That Way” (November 2002), I gave examples from &lt;br /&gt;a brilliant dichotomization propounded by Nicholas Taleeb.  His book, “Fooled By &lt;br /&gt;Randomn&lt;br /&gt;ess,” has as its theme the pervasive role of luck in investing and the tendency of &lt;br /&gt;people to overlook its effect.  He provides a table that shows a number of things in the first &lt;br /&gt;column that can easily be mistaken for things in the second column. &lt;br /&gt;Luck Skill &lt;br /&gt;Randomness Determinism &lt;br /&gt;Probability Certainty &lt;br /&gt;Belief, conjecture Knowledge, certitude &lt;br /&gt;Theory Reality &lt;br /&gt;Anecdote, coincidence Causality, law &lt;br /&gt;Survivorship &lt;br /&gt;bias Market outperformance &lt;br /&gt;Lucky idiot Skilled investor &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here, and my reason for reproducing part of Taleeb’s table, is my belief that there are &lt;br /&gt;people who see the things on the left, and there are people who see the things on the right, &lt;br /&gt;but few who see some of each.  Some people think their ability to infer causality and analyze &lt;br /&gt;data makes them skilled investors capable of producing consistent outperformance.  Others &lt;br /&gt;understand that luck plays a big part; that a lot of apparent causality is really coincidence; and &lt;br /&gt;that the person crowned the most skilled investor in a given year might be nothing more than a &lt;br /&gt;“lucky idiot.”  Very few people mix aspects from both columns. &lt;br /&gt;I can think of many qualities that seem to go together to define one of the two main types &lt;br /&gt;of investor but not the other.  I’ll discuss them below and attribute them to either the &lt;br /&gt;“Oaktree-style” investors with whom I tend to associate – “us” – or the other sort of investor – &lt;br /&gt;“them.”   &lt;br /&gt;1BUPersonality Type &lt;br /&gt;It would be great to either be middle-of-the-road and dispassionate all the time or, better yet, &lt;br /&gt;bullish or bearish at just the right time.  But few people can achieve either of those ideals.  Most &lt;br /&gt;investors are congenitally either bullish or bearish, and I’ve never seen anyone capable of &lt;br /&gt;flipping in an adroit and timely manner from one to the other.  For most of us, it’s either bullish &lt;br /&gt;most of the time or bearish most of the time – right or wrong. &lt;br /&gt;For many of the outstanding investors I’ve come across, it’s the latter.  And I shouldn’t say &lt;br /&gt;bearish – I’ve just used that word as shorthand for a number of others.  But the “us-style” &lt;br /&gt;investor tends to be cautious and defensive, while the “they-style” investor tends to be &lt;br /&gt;optimistic, confident and aggressive. &lt;br /&gt;And the investors I like most are patient.  Because they know they can’t be right every time, &lt;br /&gt;their real concern is with the long run.  On the other hand, the “I know” investor feels he has a &lt;br /&gt;good handle on what lies ahead and thus plans to do an above-average job every year – an &lt;br /&gt;admirable goal, perhaps, but I don’t think highly achievable. &lt;br /&gt;2BUHunt for Upside or Avoid Downside? &lt;br /&gt;One of the most significant ways in which these differences manifest themselves is in terms of &lt;br /&gt;attitude toward risk.  If you’re confident that you know what the future holds, risk isn’t &lt;br /&gt;frightening.  But if you’re convinced that you don’t have that good a handle on the future, it’s &lt;br /&gt;hard to be very cocky. &lt;br /&gt;Our kind of investor is preoccupied by risk, whereas I think the other is often oblivious to it.  &lt;br /&gt;Our kind worries about what can go wrong, while the other revels in what might go right.  Ours &lt;br /&gt;tries to avoid mistakes, and the othe&lt;br /&gt;r concentrates on finding winners.  Ours obsesses about &lt;br /&gt;the losers he might buy or hold, while the other dwells on the opportunities he might miss.  &lt;br /&gt;In short, it’s offense versus defense. &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3BUOther Aspects of Investment Style &lt;br /&gt;The optimist tends more often than not to be a growth investor; he’s confident that above-&lt;br /&gt;average growth can be perpetuated and that he can identify the companies that’ll do so.  The &lt;br /&gt;more cautious investor looks for value – for tangible attributes that can be counted on for price &lt;br /&gt;support even if confidence in the company proves to be unwarranted. &lt;br /&gt;Our school of investing puts great emphasis on being a contrarian.  If you want to buy &lt;br /&gt;something of solid value, and you want to buy it for less than it’s worth, you’ll have a better &lt;br /&gt;chance if you look among assets, companies and markets that are out of favor.  Thus we’re &lt;br /&gt;happiest when we’re not part of the herd; we prefer to watch the herd’s extreme boom-bust &lt;br /&gt;behavior and profit from its mi&lt;br /&gt;stakes.  Most other investors seem to be happy when they’re part &lt;br /&gt;of the herd and following the trend.   &lt;br /&gt;Our kind of investor likes to average down.  He holds a firm view of his securities’ value and &lt;br /&gt;wants to increase his holdings at lower prices.  Thus he likes to see prices decline (although he’s &lt;br /&gt;not cocky enough to completely dismiss the possibility that the market’s right rather than him).  &lt;br /&gt;The trend follower wants to see appreciation and is disheartened by initial declines.  In fact, I &lt;br /&gt;think he prefers to average up as appreciation validates his thesis.   &lt;br /&gt;Certain that his forecasts are right and his portfolio is properly positioned, the “I know” investor &lt;br /&gt;wants to let his profits ride.  The “I don’t know” investor is painfully aware of how much he &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t know; how much of his performance is beyond his control; that good fortune may have &lt;br /&gt;contributed to his results to date; and that events can easily turn against him.  Thus he’s happy &lt;br /&gt;taking profits and banking some of his gains.  If appreciation occurs beyond his expectations, it &lt;br /&gt;makes him stop and think . . . and maybe sell, not just celebrate. &lt;br /&gt;The “we” investor is comfortable holding cash when he can’t find attractive investments.  At the &lt;br /&gt;present time, a number of the investors I most respect are holding or returning significant &lt;br /&gt;amounts of cash, or closing their funds.  The confident “them” investor is pained by cash – he &lt;br /&gt;thinks he always should be able to find something worth buying.  And he tends to be more &lt;br /&gt;relative-return oriented, and thus worried that an index or competitor might beat him if he isn’t &lt;br /&gt;fully invested.   &lt;br /&gt;I see an extreme dichotomy in the fact that the “us” investor worries about losing money, while &lt;br /&gt;the other worries about underperforming.  (I can’t claim to be 100% the former, because I – and &lt;br /&gt;most of Oaktree’s clients – think that in the long run, the best manager is the one who beats the &lt;br /&gt;others.  That’s som&lt;br /&gt;ething that’s hard to argue with.  But my desire for relative performance &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t make me comfortable with losses.) &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, because the “I don’t know” investor is highly conscious of his limitations, he is likely to &lt;br /&gt;aggressively limit his assets under management.  Most of the “I know” investors, who tend to &lt;br /&gt;work in the more liquid mainstream markets, never m&lt;br /&gt;et a dollar of AUM they didn’t like – or &lt;br /&gt;didn’t feel they could achieve great things with. &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAttitudes Toward the Market &lt;br /&gt;The actions of  “they” investors are often driven by their views regarding the outlook for the &lt;br /&gt;market.  They invest more aggressively when the outlook’s positive than they do when it’s &lt;br /&gt;negative (although, as I said before, they’re usually positive).  “We” investors tend to invest &lt;br /&gt;from the bottom up, primarily basing investment decisions on whether attractive individual &lt;br /&gt;investment opportunities are available.   &lt;br /&gt;In fact, I’m often struck by the fact that “they” are preoccupied with studying and assessing the &lt;br /&gt;behavior of  “the market” – which collectively means studying themselves.  My favorite &lt;br /&gt;investors – both inside and outside Oaktree – spend their time almo&lt;br /&gt;st exclusively looking into &lt;br /&gt;individual companies and their securities.  &lt;br /&gt;One of the greatest dichotomies is that “they” impute intelligence to the market while “we” are &lt;br /&gt;highly skeptical of it.  Trillions of dollars were lost after 1998-99 because the mass of investors &lt;br /&gt;hadn’t sufficiently questioned the valuations of tech stocks.  They’d been told, “The market’s &lt;br /&gt;efficient” and assumed that if a stock was selling at a price, that meant the price was justified.  &lt;br /&gt;The investors I respect feel the market’s often wrong – either underpricing or overpricing &lt;br /&gt;securities – and more than anything else, they look for opportunities to profit from those &lt;br /&gt;errors.  In their view, as Dickens said about the law, “the market’s an ass.” &lt;br /&gt;4BUSo Where Do We Stand Today? &lt;br /&gt;The market is a big arena where optimists and pessimists engage in a tug of war.  When &lt;br /&gt;optimism is rising relative to pessimism, meaning more money wants to get put to work than &lt;br /&gt;wants to exit, prices rise (and vice versa).  The market has been going roughly sideways for the &lt;br /&gt;last few months, meaning the two camps are in rough balance.  But that doesn’t mean they’re &lt;br /&gt;not both out there. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone had a great year in 2003, and “they” seem to think it’s going to continue.  They’re &lt;br /&gt;cheered by signs of economic recovery, corporate profit gains and job growth.  “We,” on the &lt;br /&gt;other hand, worry about the things that could result in disappointment, like the lackluster &lt;br /&gt;economic and employment gains, and the trade and budget deficits.  We also worry about &lt;br /&gt;structural issues, such as the US’s reliance on foreign capital, the questionable outlook for the &lt;br /&gt;dollar, and the consumer’s high level of indebtedness and low level of savings.  Lastly, we feel &lt;br /&gt;the possibility of domestic terrorism hangs out there like a sword of Damocles. &lt;br /&gt;A particularly striking difference can be seen in current attitudes toward interest rates.  &lt;br /&gt;Rates do a great deal to influence the vitality&lt;br /&gt; of the economy and the price and relative &lt;br /&gt;attractiveness of market sectors.  Today’s low rates encourage growth and borrowing.  They &lt;br /&gt;also reduce the competition to stocks posed by bonds and money market securities.  Finally, &lt;br /&gt;since interest rates are used in present value calculations to discount future cash flows, lower &lt;br /&gt;interest rates result in higher valuations for all assets. &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, then, today’s record low rates go a long way to explaining what’s going on in the &lt;br /&gt;investment world.  With money market securities yielding 1% and Treasury notes at 3-4%, &lt;br /&gt;yields of 6-8% on high yield bonds look attractive; market-neutral hedge funds look like a &lt;br /&gt;bonanza at 9-11%; and expectations of 15-20% are enough to attract money to private equity &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(rather than the old 25-30%).  Just as importantly, low interest rates lower the hurdle return for &lt;br /&gt;equities and justify p/e ratios in the high 20s.   &lt;br /&gt;What sums it up is the line that “stocks aren’t overpriced given the current level of &lt;br /&gt;interest rates.”  “They” derive comfort from the fact that today’s valuations are consistent with &lt;br /&gt;today’s rates, while “we” worry about the impact on valuations that a rise in rates would have. &lt;br /&gt;Rates can’t go down all that much, but there’s plenty of room for them to go up.  (I still &lt;br /&gt;have the framed notice from 1980 telling me that the rate on my bank loan had reached 22¼%!)  &lt;br /&gt;That tells me that p/e ratios can’t rationally go up much more but there’s plenty of room &lt;br /&gt;for them to go down.  And if we ignore the threat of a rate rise and merely assume that rates &lt;br /&gt;will hold steady, the resulting return on the average stock would be just in line with normal &lt;br /&gt;profits growth in mid-single digits.   &lt;br /&gt;So the optimist is cheered by the low rates (and their stimulative power), and the pessimist is &lt;br /&gt;concerned about the risk implicit in a possible rate rise.  Or, as it seems to me, “we” worry &lt;br /&gt;about valuations and “they” feel comfortable on the subject . . . as usual. &lt;br /&gt;5BUHow About an Example &lt;br /&gt;Rather than hold up my Oaktree colleagues as exemplars of astute “us-style” investors (which I &lt;br /&gt;think they are), I’d like to propose an unnamed investor for your consideration.  I’ll tick off his &lt;br /&gt;credentials for inclusion (as I see them) and throw in a few quotes from his recent writings. &lt;br /&gt;He never bases his investment actions on forecasts for the economy&lt;br /&gt; or market.  “. . . the&lt;br /&gt;cemetery for seers has a huge section set aside for macro forecasters.  We have in fact made&lt;br /&gt;few macro forecasts . . , and we have seldom seen others make them with sustained&lt;br /&gt;success.”&lt;br /&gt;Rather, his actions are strictly determined by the availability of attractive investment&lt;br /&gt;opportunities.  “Under any market or economic conditions, we will be happy to buy&lt;br /&gt;businesses that meet our standards.”&lt;br /&gt;He’s a solid investor in value – be it derived from current cash flow, unique market position&lt;br /&gt;or special human resources.&lt;br /&gt;Because of his risk awareness and desire to avoid losers, he always insists on a generous&lt;br /&gt;“margin of safety.”&lt;br /&gt;He is absolutely unconcerned if an index or competitor outperforms him for a year or two,&lt;br /&gt;but he insists on avoiding losses.  Lo&lt;br /&gt;sing less than his competitors is not his definition of&lt;br /&gt;success.&lt;br /&gt;When attractive investment opportunities are few, he’s willing to stand at the plate with the&lt;br /&gt;bat on his shoulder – something he says he’s doing a lot of nowadays.  In 2003, that caused&lt;br /&gt;his holdings of cash to triple.  “Our capital is underutilized now . . . .   It’s a painfu&lt;br /&gt;l&lt;br /&gt;condition to be in – but not as painful as doing something stupid.”&lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems happiest when betting against the herd.  For example, on the subject of distressed&lt;br /&gt;bonds, he says “yesterday’s weeds” (which yielded 30-50% in 2002), are being priced as&lt;br /&gt;“today’s flowers” (and thus yielding 4-6%).  He’s written me that he “liked them better&lt;br /&gt;when they were weeds.”&lt;br /&gt;Certainly he’s a patient long-term investor (and, in fact, UnotU much of a profit taker; he &lt;br /&gt;recently expressed some regret about having not sold during The Great Bubble). &lt;br /&gt;He is very conscious of the effect of increased capital on investment returns.  “When [a&lt;br /&gt;manager] tells you that increased funds won’t hurt his investment performance, step back:&lt;br /&gt;His nose is about to grow.”&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of ways to skin the cat, and certainly there are successful investors among &lt;br /&gt;“them.”  But the characteristics enumerated above have provided the foundation for &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett’s incredible record, and that makes them good enough for me. &lt;br /&gt;*     *     *&lt;br /&gt;To help you see the picture I’m suggesting and evaluate the investors you come across, I’ve &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;repared the quick-and-dirty checklist that a ppears on the following page.  Few people will hit &lt;br /&gt;every point on the head, but I think you’ll recognize in the list on the left a lot of the “they” &lt;br /&gt;school investors you know, and on the right, hopefully, a few from the “us” school.  Each year &lt;br /&gt;– especially in good times – the headlines will go to those on the left who guess correctly. &lt;br /&gt;But in the long run I think it’s people on the right who’ll be celebrated most.&lt;br /&gt;In today’s trend toward hedge funds, I see a grow&lt;br /&gt;ing preference – whether conscious or &lt;br /&gt;unconscious – for “us” investors over “them.”  Consistent, risk-conscious, non-market-&lt;br /&gt;based investing is enjoying great popularity right now.  I’ve considered it the ticket for &lt;br /&gt;almost three decades. &lt;br /&gt;And by the way, I have one last thing to say: vive la difference!!  In order for us to be U &lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;contrarians, there has to be someone to&lt;br /&gt; be contrary to.  If everyone invested our way, the &lt;br /&gt;opportunities we prize w&lt;br /&gt;ould be few and far between.  The best opportunities for investment &lt;br /&gt;returns aren’t created by companies, exchanges or paper securities; they result from the &lt;br /&gt;mistakes other investors make.  It’s Oaktree’s job to take advantage of them.  &lt;br /&gt;May 7, 2004 &lt;br /&gt;P.s.:  As I wrote this memo, one thing pained me, and I want to address it: I found myself &lt;br /&gt;constantly writing “he,” even though I absolutely do not think investing skill is gender-related. &lt;br /&gt;It’s just that I hate the thought of using “he/she” each time.  (My son Andrew’s school uses&lt;br /&gt;s/he.)  And I find ungrammatical today’s popular, gender-neutral formulation that “the top-&lt;br /&gt;performing investor finds that their gains come from hard work” – a plural pronoun substituting &lt;br /&gt;for a singular noun.  So please bear with me; I’m really an equal opportunity memo writer.&lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Hedge Funds: A Case for Caution &lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time there was an asset class.  It was all over the headlines.  Its &lt;br /&gt;performance was terrific.  Some said “too good to be true,” but that didn’t stanch the &lt;br /&gt;flow of money.  After all, what other asset class had ever pr&lt;br /&gt;oduced returns like these? &lt;br /&gt;The performance brought vast amounts of capital to the sector.  Demand exceeded &lt;br /&gt;supply, even as funds grew larger.  The funds with the best records and discipline saw a &lt;br /&gt;deluge of money vastly exceeding their ab&lt;br /&gt;ility to accept it.  Investors whose capital they &lt;br /&gt;turned away invested with managers who were less disciplined with regard to limits or &lt;br /&gt;with new funds.  This gave rise to large numbers of start-ups and spin-offs from &lt;br /&gt;established firms.  Lack of experience didn’t prevent anyone from hanging out a shingle &lt;br /&gt;– or raising money.  Some of the leading managers increased fees in order to appropriate&lt;br /&gt;more of their returns for themselves, and this enabled second-tier and new managers to&lt;br /&gt;charge fees that used to go only for proven performance.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone agreed there was “too much money chasing too few ideas,” but they invested &lt;br /&gt;anyway, often based on their managers’ supposed skill and the fact that “Everyone’s&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;doing it; I can’t just stand by and watch while they make money.”  You could see the end &lt;br /&gt;of this tale coming down the track like a locomotive.  The perpetual motion machine &lt;br /&gt;eventually ground to a halt.  The combination of too much money chasing too few &lt;br /&gt;ideas dashed the hopes of those who in 1999-2000 looked for the “silver bullet” in &lt;br /&gt;venture capital.  “Never again,” they grumbled. &lt;br /&gt;UHope Springs Eternal &lt;br /&gt;Of course, what they meant was, “Never again until next time.”  The fact is, investors &lt;br /&gt;never cease to dream of the silver bullet: the asset class or investment technique that can &lt;br /&gt;be counted on for high returns with low risk.  Whenever one would-be silver bullet is &lt;br /&gt;discredited, investors give up on that irrational dream . . . and go looking for the next. &lt;br /&gt;I say over and over that there’s no such thing as a “good” asset class.  No asset class &lt;br /&gt;or investment technique has the birthright of a particular rate of return, and &lt;br /&gt;certainly not of a high return with low risk.  No asset can be depended on for good &lt;br /&gt;performance irrespective of the price at which it’s bought.  And no area can be &lt;br /&gt;successfully invested in without regard for the balance between the supply of &lt;br /&gt;investment ideas in the area and the amount of money investors want to deploy in it. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, if you could ask just one question about a possible investment and be assured of &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one honest answer, I think it should be “what’s the relationship between supply and &lt;br /&gt;demand?”  If there are lots of assets for sale and few takers, those assets can often be &lt;br /&gt;bought cheap.  If there are few assets offered and many would-be buyers, bargains are &lt;br /&gt;usually few and far between. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While no guarantee of a silver bullet, the former can be the source of &lt;br /&gt;some good ammunition.  With the latter you’re more likely to shoot &lt;br /&gt;yourself in the foot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe New Solution &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This memo’s about hedge funds.  They’re the hot topic in the investment world today – &lt;br /&gt;the latest would-be silver bullet – largely, I think, because most have yet to disappoint &lt;br /&gt;performance-wise and because the big asset classes look unappealing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Common stocks were the big-picture silver bullet in the 1990s.  Professor Jeremy’s &lt;br /&gt;Siegel’s “Stocks For the Long Run” assured us there had never been a long period in &lt;br /&gt;which stocks didn’t beat bonds, cash and inflation.  The authors of another book, “Dow &lt;br /&gt;36,000,” were given space on The Wall Street Journal’s op-ed page.  Thus when stocks’ &lt;br /&gt;popularity – and their representation in portfolios – hit a peak in early 2000, they were &lt;br /&gt;ready for a fall.  A swoon that included the first three consecutive losing years since the &lt;br /&gt;Depression took the S&amp;P 500 down 49% and the NASDAQ down 78%.  As a result, &lt;br /&gt;stocks receive much less attention today than they did five years ago; less is expected &lt;br /&gt;from them in terms of return (even given today’s lower prices); and they certainly aren’t &lt;br /&gt;viewed as the place to put additional capital. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither are money market assets (yielding 1%+), Treasury notes and bonds (3-5%) &lt;br /&gt;or high-grade corporate bonds (4-6%).  Institutional investors find these promised &lt;br /&gt;yields unexciting (and far below their portfolio goals of 8%+/-), and the widespread &lt;br /&gt;expectation of rising rates makes it seem likely that holding period total returns will &lt;br /&gt;be even lower.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the two biggest markets holding so little appeal – and given the fact that it has &lt;br /&gt;to go someplace – money has been flowing to non-mainstream markets such as high &lt;br /&gt;yield bonds, buyouts, real estate, oil, timber . . . and hedge funds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Hedge Fund Movement &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hedge funds did great in the 1990s, produced moderate gains during the collapse of &lt;br /&gt;stocks in 2000-02, and were in double digits in 2003.  I think they also exhibit many of &lt;br /&gt;the traits associated with the venture capital boom described on page one of this memo, &lt;br /&gt;including widespread investor participation.  I don’t think hedge funds will bring &lt;br /&gt;losses at all comparable to what happened in venture capital at the peak, but I &lt;br /&gt;think their popularity is overdone and likely to lead to disappointment.  Given the &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;magnitude of the hedge fund movement, a memo on the subject has become inevitable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, what are hedge funds?  Briefly put, they’re unregulated private partnerships that &lt;br /&gt;commingle the assets of institutions and wealthy individuals in pursuit of superior &lt;br /&gt;investment results.  They’re evergreen vehicles that offer periodic withdrawal &lt;br /&gt;opportunities to their investors, as opposed to closed-end entities such as private equity &lt;br /&gt;funds that promise no option to withdraw but begin to liquidate after a certain date and &lt;br /&gt;return money as they do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except for one other factor, they can have very little else in common.  Hedge funds &lt;br /&gt;operate in a great many ways.  There are arbitrage funds in fixed income, mergers, &lt;br /&gt;convertibles and “stat arb”; long/short funds in stocks in general, tech stocks and &lt;br /&gt;emerging markets; macro funds which place bets on currencies and world markets; and &lt;br /&gt;funds which make mostly-long bets in specialized market niches such as distressed debt.  &lt;br /&gt;There are small hedge funds and enormous hedge funds.  Some hedge funds hedge – go &lt;br /&gt;short or otherwise take offsetting positions designed to reduce risk – and others &lt;br /&gt;don’t.  Thus some aim for steady returns with little volatility and market exposure, &lt;br /&gt;and some make massive, unhedged bets in pursuit of massive returns.  Some hedge &lt;br /&gt;funds can fairly be described as pursuing “absolute return,” and in the rest the &lt;br /&gt;returns are anything but absolute. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s that one remaining thing that hedge funds have in common?  It’s called “hedge &lt;br /&gt;fund pricing,” meaning the manager gets an annual management fee of at least 1-2% &lt;br /&gt;plus a share – usually 20% – of all profits earned in the portfolio.  In a world where the &lt;br /&gt;fees paid to long-only managers in traditional asset classes are a fraction of one &lt;br /&gt;percent, hedge fund pricing allows managers to make 3-4% or more and represents &lt;br /&gt;the raison d’etre for the hedge fund industry.  One of the cleverest observations I’ve &lt;br /&gt;read is from Paul Isaac of Cadogan Management: “hedge funds are a compensation &lt;br /&gt;system often mistaken for an industry.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From little or nothing a few years ago, many institutional investors now have 5-10% or &lt;br /&gt;more invested in hedge funds today.  This has given rise to a massive expansion of the &lt;br /&gt;hedge fund community. There are estimated to be 7,000 hedge funds today, up from &lt;br /&gt;1,640 a decade ago.  Their current capital is estimated at between $850 billion and $1 &lt;br /&gt;trillion, up about ten times in ten years and well over 100% since the end of 2000.  We &lt;br /&gt;read often of pension plans deciding to commit billions of dollars of additional capital to &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds.  How will it play out? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UScalability &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, scalability is the most important issue surrounding hedge funds: &lt;br /&gt;can a good little idea become a good big idea?  Everyone wonders about the &lt;br /&gt;scalability of hedge funds, but I think they’re yet another area where most people &lt;br /&gt;agree on the existence of the potential problems but invest anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the mid-Seventies that I first began to hear of hedge funds such as Cumberland &lt;br /&gt;Partners and Steinhardt, Fine and Berkowitz.  At that time the hedge fund industry &lt;br /&gt;consisted of a handful of funds trying to earn superior returns with total capital of a &lt;br /&gt;billion dollars or so.  The funds limited their capital; researched smaller companies in &lt;br /&gt;greater depth than the mainstream investors; concentrated their portfolios in a handful of &lt;br /&gt;good ideas; and used shorting and hedging (but not leverage) to shape the pattern of their &lt;br /&gt;returns.  For better or worse, their success over the ensuing 30 years led to fame and &lt;br /&gt;widespread emulation.  As a result, we now have thousands of funds trying to earn &lt;br /&gt;superior returns with roughly a trillion dollars, and with much more on the way.  &lt;br /&gt;(On September 13 The Bank of New York predicted that U.S. institutional investors &lt;br /&gt;alone would plow an additional $250 billion into hedge funds by 2008.)  Can it still &lt;br /&gt;work? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope you’ll permit me one of my tortured analogies.  Have you seen the nature film on &lt;br /&gt;TV showing big fish eating?  One of the big fellows rips a piece from his prey and &lt;br /&gt;moves through the water enjoying his dinner.  But due to his poor table manners, he &lt;br /&gt;spews small crumbs as he goes.  It’s for this reason that each big fish is trailed by a &lt;br /&gt;hundred little fish.  They snack on the scraps he drops, enjoying his leavings.  He does &lt;br /&gt;the hard work, and they get a free lunch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well that’s the way I’ve always thought of the investment world.  Mainstream &lt;br /&gt;institutional investors emphasize the big asset classes and follow the big companies, &lt;br /&gt;creating a relatively efficient market and a context for relative valuation.  But their &lt;br /&gt;attention wanes as the targets shrink, and their hands are tied by constraints on &lt;br /&gt;their behavior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little guys such as hedge funds operate in the interstices.  They take advantage of &lt;br /&gt;small inefficiencies and misvaluations that the big guys create, permit or ignore.  &lt;br /&gt;They pursue things that are unseemly, esoteric or highly labor intensive.  And they &lt;br /&gt;can employ tactics like leverage and shorting – and live with levels of portfolio &lt;br /&gt;concentration and illiquidity – that aren’t tolerated in the mainstream investment &lt;br /&gt;world.  In other words they, too, benefit from the big guys’ leavings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The critical question is obvious:  How many little fish can thrive in the shadow of &lt;br /&gt;each big fish?  A hundred little fish trailing each big one all can do well.  But those &lt;br /&gt;crumbs won’t feed five hundred.  Not only will the crumbs be insufficient in number, &lt;br /&gt;but the crowd will fight over them in a way that’s unhealthy for everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tortured enough?  Maybe so, but I think the analogy holds.  In my time in this &lt;br /&gt;business, the institutions have been the big fish of the investment world, and the &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds and alternative investment specialists have profited from their biases &lt;br /&gt;and limitations.  But quintuple the number of “little guys” and maybe they’ll no &lt;br /&gt;longer exhibit the same brilliance and adroitness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; How many under-researched stocks are there, and how much can be invested in &lt;br /&gt;them? &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How much of a bargain-priced security can be bought without the price being driven &lt;br /&gt;up? &lt;br /&gt; How big an arbitrage position can be put on without the profit spread shrinking? &lt;br /&gt; How many shares of an overvalued stock are available for short-sellers to borrow? &lt;br /&gt; How much of something can the hedge funds collectively own without illiquidity &lt;br /&gt;closing their exit window? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When there’s an increase in the amount of capital that investors want to put into &lt;br /&gt;an area, there’s no reason to expect a commensurate increase in the opportunities &lt;br /&gt;for good investment.  So when the ratio of money to ideas increases, the &lt;br /&gt;implications for future performance can’t be good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now it should be made clear that the venture capital boom, for one example, was based &lt;br /&gt;in a very narrow investment segment and dependent on the creation of new companies &lt;br /&gt;for the deployment of capital.  Hedge funds, on the other hand, collectively are able to &lt;br /&gt;invest in any form of asset or security, in all of the world’s markets and employing a &lt;br /&gt;wide variety of investment techniques, and through shorting they have to ability to &lt;br /&gt;profit from “inefficiencies” in overvalued as well as undervalued assets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus the potential universe for hedge fund investments is enormous in the absolute.  The &lt;br /&gt;real question is whether there are enough inefficiencies in this universe for all of the &lt;br /&gt;would-be hedge funds to invest in, and whether the presence of a large and growing &lt;br /&gt;number of funds has a deleterious effect on the adequacy of the supply. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, it goes without saying: just as no asset class has the birthright of a given &lt;br /&gt;return, giving something the overly broad label of “hedge fund” – and paying its &lt;br /&gt;manager “two-plus-twenty” – won’t make it a stellar, or even a steady, performer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Hedge Fund Manager’s Superior Arsenal &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great deal is made of the powerful tools at the hedge fund manager’s disposal.  The &lt;br /&gt;ability to employ leverage – often in unlimited amounts – and the absence of constraints &lt;br /&gt;on investment tactics are lauded for their potential to add to results.  But no one should &lt;br /&gt;forget their potential to do the opposite as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost every weapon in the investment arsenal is a two-edged sword.  The only &lt;br /&gt;exception is genuine, sustainable personal skill.  Everything else will make you &lt;br /&gt;money when it works but lose you money when it doesn’t.  Leverage and free rein &lt;br /&gt;are no exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being able to leverage a portfolio means being able to invest a multiple of your equity &lt;br /&gt;capital.  Why should an investor with $1,000 be content making $100 on a price rise of &lt;br /&gt;10%?  Why not borrow another $3,000, invest all $4,000 in the same assets, and make &lt;br /&gt;$400 on a 10% rise?  All you need is access to 3-to-1 leverage . . . oh yes, and the ability &lt;br /&gt;to identify assets that appreciate. &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vegas they say, “the more you bet, the more you win when you win.”  Although the &lt;br /&gt;logic of this statement is impeccable, it omits the obvious addendum “. . . and the more &lt;br /&gt;you lose when you lose.”  Leverage is not a source of alpha; it’s a way of increasing &lt;br /&gt;your exposure to a given amount of alpha . . . or lack of alpha.  The 3-to-1 leverager &lt;br /&gt;described above will lose 40% of his equity if prices go down 10% instead of up.  The &lt;br /&gt;ability to use leverage – which is high and rising today given the low cost of money and &lt;br /&gt;the lure of the “carry trade” – certainly doesn’t add asymmetrically to investment &lt;br /&gt;results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither does freedom from constraints.  Institutional investors usually spend lots of time &lt;br /&gt;negotiating what tactics a mainstream investor will be permitted to apply and crafting &lt;br /&gt;contracts to keep him from straying afield.  Then they turn over a bunch of money to a &lt;br /&gt;hedge fund manager and say, “do as you please.”  (I exaggerate for effect.)  Does that &lt;br /&gt;make sense?  Only in one case: where the manager possesses great skill and discipline. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investment constraints (1) enable clients to know what style of management they’ll be &lt;br /&gt;getting and (2) hopefully limit managers to what they’re good at.  Their absence sets &lt;br /&gt;the stage for surprises and permits managers to wander into areas where they may have &lt;br /&gt;less skill.  Thus the results from unrestrained hedge funds are often unforeseeable, and &lt;br /&gt;these vehicles should be handled with care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think investors should pay above average fees only for asymmetric value added – &lt;br /&gt;that is, for a potential increment to returns that isn’t accompanied by a &lt;br /&gt;corresponding potential decrement.  And I think only genuine skill adds &lt;br /&gt;asymmetrically to investment results, not leverage and not the mere ability to use a &lt;br /&gt;wide range of investment tactics.  The key in hedge fund investing is finding &lt;br /&gt;managers who have that skill. It isn’t ubiquitous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UA Few Words on Performance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I wonder whether the decision to invest in hedge funds today is fully supported &lt;br /&gt;by their performance in 2000-04, their period of great popularity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve watched institutions decide to join hedge funds.  I think most of them invested for &lt;br /&gt;“absolute returns” – which I believe were supposed to be in the high single digits after &lt;br /&gt;fees – accompanied by low volatility and limited correlation with the mainstream &lt;br /&gt;markets.  Now most institutions seem to be satisfied with their hedge fund performance &lt;br /&gt;and are signing up for more.  But I wonder whether they should be.  For the purposes &lt;br /&gt;of the analysis below I’ll use the CSFB/Tremont Hedge Fund Index. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 down 9%, 12% and 22% in the 2000-02 bear market, investors in &lt;br /&gt;the CSFB/Tremont Index’s average fund were delighted to make money, with the &lt;br /&gt;Index returning 4.9%, 4.4% and 3.0% in those years, respectively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And fund investors who might have expected much less were thrilled to see 15.4% &lt;br /&gt;from the Index in 2003. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the surface, all seems well: small gains when the stock market cratered, and a pleasant &lt;br /&gt;surprise in the big year of 2003.  But is everything really all right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Were the results in 2000-02 all they should have been?  Because everyone was &lt;br /&gt;understandably thrilled to make money while stocks collapsed, I don’t hear anyone &lt;br /&gt;grumbling about modest returns.  But should they be?  Institutional Investor magazine &lt;br /&gt;made the point in February 2003: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hedge funds had a good year in 2002 – relatively speaking, of course. . .  The &lt;br /&gt;trouble is, hedge funds are not merely supposed to do better than other &lt;br /&gt;investments.  They’re meant to outperform in absolute terms [I think this &lt;br /&gt;should be “perform in absolute terms”].  And most did not do that in 2002. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Many students of the hedge fund area believe returns should be a function of interest &lt;br /&gt;rates, for example “LIBOR plus 500.”  In the early years of this decade, far less was &lt;br /&gt;achieved. Do the negative returns in the stock market fully explain the difference? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With 2003 one of the best years in history in most markets, was 15.4% enough? In 1996, &lt;br /&gt;’97 and ’99, the Hedge Fund Index captured a very substantial majority of the S&amp;P’s &lt;br /&gt;return.  Why in 2003 did it garner just over half the gain?  Obviously the ability of the &lt;br /&gt;average hedge fund to beat the booming S&amp;P in 1999 was an outlier, with active flipping &lt;br /&gt;of IPOs and other ways to “pick off” feverish retail investors presenting unusual profit &lt;br /&gt;opportunities.  1998’s negative return was equally aberrant, with the Index return pulled &lt;br /&gt;down by a 38% loss on the average emerging market hedge fund.  But with these caveats &lt;br /&gt;in mind, why was the capture rate in 2003 so tepid? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Year &lt;br /&gt;    CSFB/Tremont &lt;br /&gt;Long/Short Index &lt;br /&gt;Return &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;S&amp;P 500 Return  &lt;br /&gt;   Hedge Fund Return as &lt;br /&gt;Percentage of S&amp;P &lt;br /&gt;Return &lt;br /&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;1996  22.2%  22.7%     98% &lt;br /&gt;1997  25.9  33.1     78 &lt;br /&gt;1998  -0.4  28.3     n/m &lt;br /&gt;1999  23.4  20.9     112 &lt;br /&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;2003  15.4  28.4     54 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;•   Most recently, the CSFB/Tremont Hedge Fund Index is up just 2.8% in the first eight &lt;br /&gt;months of lackluster 2004.  Again we must ask whether modest single digit &lt;br /&gt;returns are all that can be expected absent a tailwind from a strong stock &lt;br /&gt;market.  What happened to the absolute return that would be earned with little &lt;br /&gt;reference to what went on in the markets?  If the low returns are attributable to &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weak underlying markets, doesn’t that suggest more correlation to market &lt;br /&gt;movements than was implied by the “absolute return” premise? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, has hedge fund performance since 2000 been good enough?  “Single &lt;br /&gt;digits in down years and double digits in up years” sounds like a good deal.  “Modest &lt;br /&gt;returns in bad years and modest participation in good years” is a little less &lt;br /&gt;appealing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can think of four possible explanations for any shortfall from expectations: two &lt;br /&gt;benign and two unpleasant: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If recent returns have been below expectations, this may be attributable to the low &lt;br /&gt;level of interest rates.  Interest rates influence what funds will earn on their idle &lt;br /&gt;balances, proceeds from short sales, and arbitrage positions.  So maybe hedge fund &lt;br /&gt;returns are due to pick up as short-term rates rise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And maybe hedge funds’ good returns will be earned on average, rather than every &lt;br /&gt;year, and this has just been a below average period. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But maybe more hungry “fish” with more money crowding into a given market are &lt;br /&gt;having the predictable depressant effect on returns.  Maybe there’s a fixed amount &lt;br /&gt;of excess return available to be earned in a given year, and when it’s spread over &lt;br /&gt;a lot more capital, the results become less positive.  Or, even worse, maybe the &lt;br /&gt;combined efforts of all these people make the markets more efficient, reducing &lt;br /&gt;the total excess return available for them to share. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Perhaps the increase in the number of hedge fund managers has brought a decrease in &lt;br /&gt;their average alpha.  Why should we believe the last 20,000 managers to join the &lt;br /&gt;sector are as smart as the first 1,000?  One of the rationales for hedge fund &lt;br /&gt;investing, as The Wall Street Journal put it on July 7, is that, “Hedge funds still attract &lt;br /&gt;the smartest managers, lured by the rich fees.” I may be missing something, but why &lt;br /&gt;should the appeal of rich fees be limited to smart managers?  Can’t they attract the &lt;br /&gt;not-so-smart as well? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s my personal guess that there’s truth in each of these four possible explanations. &lt;br /&gt;But if that’s the case, the latter two will have a deleterious effect despite the validity of &lt;br /&gt;the former. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UDrawbacks and Pitfalls &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are enough people out there trumpeting the benefits of hedge funds; you don’t need &lt;br /&gt;me to repeat them.  I’ll just play my normal worrier’s role by listing some caveats: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The performance data on which investors are making the decision to commit to hedge &lt;br /&gt;funds is highly imperfect. It is unsystematic, unscientific and covers a short and not-&lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;necessarily-representative period.  In addition, it’s weakened by post-selection bias &lt;br /&gt;(low-return funds are unlikely to volunteer their performance) and survivorship bias &lt;br /&gt;(the estimated 25% of funds that go out of business each year are even less apt to do &lt;br /&gt;so).  Importantly, holdings of illiquid or infrequently marked securities can cause &lt;br /&gt;betas and risk to be understated and thus Sharpe ratios to be overstated (Pensions &amp; &lt;br /&gt;Investments, August 19, 2002). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It is obvious that some of the tactics employed by hedge funds entail considerable &lt;br /&gt;volatility and illiquidity.  And yet, hedge funds give their investors the periodic right &lt;br /&gt;to withdraw.  Thus, it’s possible for a hedge fund to offer more liquidity than &lt;br /&gt;does its underlying investment portfolio. This can be a formula for disaster.  Given &lt;br /&gt;that a lot of the capital now in hedge funds is “hot money” prone to exit given a &lt;br /&gt;period of underperformance, it’s not hard to envision (and in fact the community has &lt;br /&gt;seen) rapid-fire withdrawals that lead to downward spirals and penalize the last &lt;br /&gt;investors out the door, who can find themselves owning disproportionate amounts of &lt;br /&gt;hard-to-value and hard-to-sell securities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In most hedge funds, it’s hoped that the managers’ actions will neutralize the effect of &lt;br /&gt;market fluctuations.  In other words, you’re betting on the managers’ skill, not the &lt;br /&gt;market direction. As in any inefficient, alpha-based market niche, the &lt;br /&gt;performance gap between superior and inferior managers can be substantial.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus you’d better find superior managers, and that’s not easy. Also, since many &lt;br /&gt;of the best and most disciplined managers have closed their funds, you’d better &lt;br /&gt;hope the available funds will be able to replicate the returns that attracted you to &lt;br /&gt;the area in the first place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With thousands of hedge funds all using computers to screen investment &lt;br /&gt;opportunities, there’s a tendency for lots of them to move in the same direction at the &lt;br /&gt;same time.  This can shrink purchase opportunities, eat into prospective returns &lt;br /&gt;and reduce liquidity. The Wall Street Journal described the situation on June 30: &lt;br /&gt;“Increasingly, the growing group of hedge funds pile into the same trades.  With so &lt;br /&gt;much money chasing similar strategies, good investment returns become more &lt;br /&gt;elusive.  Moreover, when an attractive idea turns sour, the rush to the exits gets &lt;br /&gt;crowded, exacerbating an already tense investment environment.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We read often about the migration to the hedge fund world of people from elsewhere &lt;br /&gt;in the investment industry.  This is the same phenomenon as we saw in the dot-coms &lt;br /&gt;in 1998-99.  When people flood an area because of the easy money to be made there, &lt;br /&gt;the results are usually predictable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I’m particularly skeptical of the movement of people from traditional portfolio &lt;br /&gt;management to hedge funds. Stock picking ability isn’t sufficient for success in &lt;br /&gt;managing a hedged and/or leveraged portfolio -- risk management is at least as &lt;br /&gt;important.  The two are not the same, and the traditional buyside professional &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t have much experience in the latter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As has happened in other alternative investment fields, changes in an industry can &lt;br /&gt;expose weaknesses in the compensation arrangements.  Originally, management fees &lt;br /&gt;were intended primarily to cover operating expenses while incentive fees motivated &lt;br /&gt;managers to strive for profits. But as funds grow larger, some are at the point where &lt;br /&gt;managers can get rich on management fees alone.  Recently we’ve seen investment &lt;br /&gt;celebrities start hedge funds with perhaps $3 billion of capital and management fees &lt;br /&gt;of 2% or so.  $60 million a year is a pretty good start if you can get it.  Fees like these &lt;br /&gt;can motivate managers to put a higher priority on perpetuating the management fee &lt;br /&gt;machine than on pursuing portfolio gains.  Although hedge funds and private equity &lt;br /&gt;funds carry similar fee arrangements, the latter have hurdle rates that motivate their &lt;br /&gt;managers to try for double-digit returns.  Hedge fund managers probably figure they &lt;br /&gt;can hold onto their capital and earn 2-4% a year for themselves with returns in &lt;br /&gt;moderate single digits. I’m not sure that warrants the fees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At the other end of the spectrum from managers able to attract billions in capital and &lt;br /&gt;massive management fees, the impatient newcomer with access to incentive fee &lt;br /&gt;money faces potential temptation that also might trouble investors:  It makes perfect &lt;br /&gt;sense for him to start a fund and swing for the fences with highly risky securities, &lt;br /&gt;leverage and concentration.  Hit a homer and he’s rich; strike out and he goes back to &lt;br /&gt;his old job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We know incentive fees can serve to align interests between investors and their &lt;br /&gt;managers when profits are in the offing. But what happens when there are losses? &lt;br /&gt;When a fund has run up some serious losses and needs to recover to the “high-water &lt;br /&gt;mark” before it can generate incentive fees again, its personnel don’t stand to share in &lt;br /&gt;gains for a while.  So what is there to make them stay around to engineer the &lt;br /&gt;recovery, rather than move to a new fund where they can profit from dollar one?  On &lt;br /&gt;July 15 The Wall Street Journal described one such situation: “Rather than try to dig &lt;br /&gt;out of the deep hole, while at the same time not getting paid as much as they could &lt;br /&gt;earn elsewhere, Mr. James and his team began to contemplate starting out on their &lt;br /&gt;own.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, I’ll list a few other topics that may make hedge funds the subject of negative &lt;br /&gt;headlines in the future:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;o  the risk implicit in the combination of leveraged hedge funds, leveraged funds of &lt;br /&gt;funds, and leveraged fund investors; &lt;br /&gt;o  the absence of registration and regulation; &lt;br /&gt;o  the lack of transparency; &lt;br /&gt;o  the potential conflicts that arise when hedge funds are run within an organization &lt;br /&gt;that also manages non-hedge fund money in the same markets; &lt;br /&gt;o  hedge funds’ involvement in buyouts (do they have the needed skills? will it &lt;br /&gt;reduce their liquidity and ability to value the portfolio for &lt;br /&gt;subscriptions/redemptions?); &lt;br /&gt;o  buyout firms’ growing involvement in hedge funds (still more competitors?); &lt;br /&gt;o  possible improprieties in hedge fund marketing; &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o  concern over the impact of hedge fund short selling; &lt;br /&gt;o  and, of course, the outright fraud that occasionally arises and always is a threat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Outlook for Hedge Fund Investing &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, despite the troubling factors enumerated above, I do not envision &lt;br /&gt;a boom-bust scenario for hedge fund investors.  After all, hedge funds spread their &lt;br /&gt;investment over almost all asset classes, and most funds are fairly disciplined in sticking &lt;br /&gt;to low-priced investments.  So there isn’t a single asset or group of assets where we &lt;br /&gt;have to worry about hedge funds creating bubble-like appreciation and the usual &lt;br /&gt;subsequent collapse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, the excesses aren’t in the prices of the assets in which hedge funds invest.  The &lt;br /&gt;excesses are in the trends affecting the industry: too much money coming too fast; &lt;br /&gt;too many funds managed by people of uneven skill; and too-high fees relative to the &lt;br /&gt;limited excess return the average fund is likely to generate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not expect a debacle, just a disappointing experience.  The sad fact is that, on &lt;br /&gt;average, hedge funds may go down as just another former silver bullet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The high single digit return for which I think people invested wasn’t a figment of &lt;br /&gt;anyone’s imagination.  It was probably reasonable looking back at the period preceding &lt;br /&gt;the current hedge fund boom.  After all, in a period when stocks consistently returned &lt;br /&gt;double digits, Treasury notes paid 6% and high yield bonds yielded 12%, it’s eminently &lt;br /&gt;logical that a few highly skilled hedge fund managers could earn 8-9% or more after fees &lt;br /&gt;on a low-risk basis. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But that scenario doesn’t describe today or tomorrow.  There’s no reason to expect a &lt;br /&gt;near-term repeat of stock and bond returns like those, and certainly the hedge fund arena &lt;br /&gt;is far more crowded than it’s ever been.  So I think the average hedge fund might make &lt;br /&gt;5-6% net of fees in the years just ahead.  (That could change after lower prices and &lt;br /&gt;higher interest rates re-elevate the prospective returns on stocks and bonds – and after &lt;br /&gt;some disappointed capital departs the hedge fund field – but I’m just dealing here with &lt;br /&gt;the current environment.  And please note that I’m not making a prediction, just a wild &lt;br /&gt;guess within a wide range.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll go with 5-6% for the average hedge fund – considerably more from the best &lt;br /&gt;managers, less from the worst and, yes, total loss from the occasional risk-&lt;br /&gt;management disaster.  Is that terrible?  No. But the question is whether it will be &lt;br /&gt;entirely satisfactory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; First, I think it may be less than the hedge fund managers and consultants have &lt;br /&gt;predicted. &lt;br /&gt; Second, it will put most institutions further behind their overall investment goals. &lt;br /&gt; And third, I think it’ll look pretty anemic if Treasury note yields return to that range, &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as they may, or if stocks can get anywhere close to their long-term 10% historic &lt;br /&gt;average. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A net return of 5-6% earned with low risk in a low-return world may sound pretty good &lt;br /&gt;to lots of people, especially in light of the pain that long-only common stock investors &lt;br /&gt;experienced in 2000-02.  I believe a great deal of current hedge fund investment is &lt;br /&gt;motivated by a desire for mid-single digit returns with safety, and also that a lot of &lt;br /&gt;funds have been designed to deliver them.  Managers are constraining risk; locking in &lt;br /&gt;profits at modest levels; dedicating their efforts to avoiding down months and quarters; &lt;br /&gt;and refraining from reaching for the stars.  Some of this is good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I think paying fees of 2-4% to earn net returns of 5-6% may start to get old, &lt;br /&gt;especially if and when returns on mainstream stock and bonds get back to more &lt;br /&gt;attractive levels.  That’s why I worry about the potential for disappointment.  Right &lt;br /&gt;now, in a world of 1% money market rates and lackluster returns everywhere, that &lt;br /&gt;may be sufficient.  But sentiment is inherently unstable, and I’m not sure investors &lt;br /&gt;will remain content if they begin to miss out on more elsewhere . . . while paying the &lt;br /&gt;highest fees in the investment world to do so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To start bringing this memo to a close, I’ll cite John Moon and Tim Jensen’s apt &lt;br /&gt;enumeration of the possible outcomes in our Emerging Markets Fund’s second quarter &lt;br /&gt;letter: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have no idea if the hedge fund boom will peter out after several years of &lt;br /&gt;mediocre performance, end in another [Long-Term Capital Management] &lt;br /&gt;crescendo, or continue until all money is either indexed or run by hedge funds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In testimony to Congress, Alan Greenspan focused on what I think is the most likely &lt;br /&gt;result: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hedge funds seek out the abnormal rates of profit often found where markets are &lt;br /&gt;otherwise inefficient.  But these above-normal profits have attracted a large &lt;br /&gt;number of new entrants seeking to exploit a possibly narrowing field of &lt;br /&gt;inefficiencies.  Not surprisingly the rate of return in this activity is reportedly &lt;br /&gt;declining.  I would not be surprised if, with time, many of the new entrants exited, &lt;br /&gt;some presumably following large losses.  (The Wall Street Journal, July  &lt;br /&gt;23) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*     *     * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my treasury of investment sayings, there’s a special section reserved for what I call &lt;br /&gt;“the classics.”  None is more dependable than this:  What the wise man does in the &lt;br /&gt;beginning, the fool does in the end.  Intrepid pioneering investors get the underpriced &lt;br /&gt;gems.  Once something has been discovered and the price bid up, the latecomers who &lt;br /&gt;come aboard in ever-increasing numbers – lured by past performance – can look forward &lt;br /&gt;to less return and more risk. &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine an investment area whose attractiveness can survive the onslaught of an &lt;br /&gt;investor herd thinking it constitutes the silver bullet.  It wouldn’t make sense for one to &lt;br /&gt;exist, given that it’s the job of a smoothly functioning market to eliminate opportunities &lt;br /&gt;for unusual profits.  “Too much money chasing too few ideas” has been the death &lt;br /&gt;knell for investment fad after fad. This will never cease to be so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hedge funds are just like any other investment tool.  They are neither a good idea &lt;br /&gt;nor a bad idea.  They have both plusses and minuses.  They’re subject to market &lt;br /&gt;forces capable of altering their attractiveness.  And like any other investment that’s &lt;br /&gt;in vogue, they should be handled with great care, with eyes wide open. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The right hedge funds may be just what the doctor ordered for investors who place a high &lt;br /&gt;priority on stable returns and are willing to trade away a lot of their upside potential for &lt;br /&gt;that stability.  The key will be finding managers who possess skill, discipline and &lt;br /&gt;integrity.  Doing so won’t prove easy; there’s no reason why finding superior managers &lt;br /&gt;should be any easier than finding superior investments.  But as in other quarters of the &lt;br /&gt;investing universe, the rewards for success can be substantial. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s no question that some of the smartest investment managers are gravitating to the &lt;br /&gt;hedge fund arena with its out-sized financial rewards.  But they’re not the only ones &lt;br /&gt;being drawn to the money, and some of the rest will turn out to be incompetent or &lt;br /&gt;downright unscrupulous.  The tools are there for hedge fund managers to use, but all the &lt;br /&gt;tools in the world won’t produce superior risk-adjusted returns without superior skill.  &lt;br /&gt;Just as all managers can’t be in the top quartile, all hedge fund managers are &lt;br /&gt;unlikely to be smart enough to identify the markets’ mistakes; undoubtedly some of &lt;br /&gt;them will be the ones making those mistakes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, my personal bottom line: the most important element in the decision to &lt;br /&gt;invest in a hedge fund shouldn’t be the sheer profit potential, but your comfort in &lt;br /&gt;entrusting its managers with the combination of potent investment tactics, high-&lt;br /&gt;octane fees and the absence of a hurdle rate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;October 6, 2004 &lt;br /&gt;2004 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re:    Risk  &lt;br /&gt;The reading materials for a meeting of a corporate board on which I sit – and what turned out to &lt;br /&gt;be an eight-hour meeting of the audit committee (thank you, Messrs. Sarbanes and Oxley) – &lt;br /&gt;included an article by Rick Funston, a Principal of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP and its National &lt;br /&gt;Practice Leader for Governance and Risk Oversight.  The subject of the article was corporate &lt;br /&gt;risk, but many of its points were equally applicable to investment risk.  It got me thinking. &lt;br /&gt;We’re all preoccupied with the quest for excellent investment returns, and most of us understand &lt;br /&gt;that risk managem&lt;br /&gt;ent has a lot to do with achieving them.  From there, investment orthodoxy &lt;br /&gt;often takes over, with the discussion turning to the relationship between return and volatility.  &lt;br /&gt;But I think that tells so little of the story that I’ve decided to devote an entire memo to the subject &lt;br /&gt;of risk. &lt;br /&gt;0BUWhy Does Risk Matter? &lt;br /&gt;When I joined the investment management industry at the tail end of the 1960s, everyone talked &lt;br /&gt;about returns but few people talked about risk-adjusted returns, or the idea that risk ma&lt;br /&gt;tters.  I &lt;br /&gt;was fortunate, however, to have attended the University of Chicago in the preceding years, &lt;br /&gt;during which Capital Market Theory had begun to be discussed. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, nothing underlies the Capital Market approach as much as the relationship between &lt;br /&gt;risk and return.  This plays out as follows: &lt;br /&gt;First, because people are risk averse, riskier investments have to offer higher returns in order&lt;br /&gt;to attract capital.&lt;br /&gt;Second, if in&lt;br /&gt;vestors are skillful, they should be able to capture higher returns on their riskier&lt;br /&gt;investments, and thus they should show higher average returns in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;But investors’ returns tell just half the story.  We have to know how much risk they took to&lt;br /&gt;get those returns before we can judge whether they did a good or a bad job.  Thus developed&lt;br /&gt;the concept of risk-adjusted returns.&lt;br /&gt;It is from the relationship between risk and return that arises the graphic representation that has &lt;br /&gt;become ubiquitous in the investment world.  It shows a “capital market line” that slopes upward &lt;br /&gt;to the right, indicating the positive relationship between risk and return that is essential. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;0&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;0&lt;br /&gt;Before going further, I want to stop for a brief tirade.  In my opinion, especially in good times, &lt;br /&gt;far too many people can be overheard saying, “Riskier investments provide higher returns.  &lt;br /&gt;If you want&lt;br /&gt; to make more money, the answer is to take more ris&lt;br /&gt;k.”  But riskier investments &lt;br /&gt;absolutely cannot be counted on to deliver higher returns.  Why not?  It’s simple: if riskier &lt;br /&gt;investments reliably produced higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier!   &lt;br /&gt;The correct formulation is that in or&lt;br /&gt;der to attract capital, riskier investments have to offer the &lt;br /&gt;prospect of higher returns, or higher promised returns, or higher expected returns.  But there’s &lt;br /&gt;absolutely nothing to say those higher prospective returns have to materialize.   &lt;br /&gt;The way I conceptualize the capital market line makes it easier for me to relate to the &lt;br /&gt;relationship underlying it all: &lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;0&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;0&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riskier investments are those where the outcome is less certain.  That is, the probability &lt;br /&gt;distribution of returns is wider.  When priced fairly, riskier investments should entail: &lt;br /&gt;higher expected returns,&lt;br /&gt;the possibility of lower returns, and&lt;br /&gt;in some cases the possibility of losses.&lt;br /&gt;The traditional graph shown first above is deceptive, because it communicates the positive &lt;br /&gt;connection between risk and return but fails to suggest the uncertainty involved.  It has brought a &lt;br /&gt;lot of people a lot of misery through its unwavering intimation that taking more risk leads to &lt;br /&gt;making more money.   &lt;br /&gt;I hope my version of the graph is more helpful.  It’s meant to suggest both the positive &lt;br /&gt;relationship between risk and expected return and the fact that uncertainty about the return and &lt;br /&gt;the possibility of loss increase as ris&lt;br /&gt;k increases. &lt;br /&gt;1BUWhat Is Risk?  &lt;br /&gt;According to the academicians who developed Capital Market Theory, risk equals volatility, &lt;br /&gt;because volatility indicates th&lt;br /&gt;e unreliability of an investment.  I take great issue with this &lt;br /&gt;definition of risk.   &lt;br /&gt;It’s my view that – knowingly or unknowingly – academicians settled on volatility as the proxy &lt;br /&gt;for risk as a matter of convenience.  They needed a number for their calculations that was &lt;br /&gt;objective and could be ascertained historically and extrapolated into the future.  Volatility fits the &lt;br /&gt;bill, and most of the other types of risk do not.  The problem with all of this, however, is that I &lt;br /&gt;just don’t think volatility is the risk most investors care about. &lt;br /&gt;There are many kinds of risk, and I’ll discuss some of them below.  But volatility may be the &lt;br /&gt;least relevant of them all.  Theory says investors demand more return from investments that are &lt;br /&gt;more volatile.  But for the market to set the prices for investments such that more volatile &lt;br /&gt;investments will appear likely to produce higher returns, there have to be people &lt;br /&gt;demanding that relationship, and I haven’t met them yet.  I’ve never heard anyone at Oaktree &lt;br /&gt;– or anywhere else, for that matter – say, “I won’t buy it, because its price might show big&lt;br /&gt;fluctuations,” or “I won’t buy it, because it might have a down quarter.”  Thus it’s hard for me to&lt;br /&gt;believe volatility is the risk investors factor in when setting prices and prospective returns.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, volatility has a number of shortcomings that aren’t often addressed in the literature &lt;br /&gt;but are obvious to investment practitioners: &lt;br /&gt;A stock that meanders from $50 to $80 is likely to have the same statistical volatility as one&lt;br /&gt;that goes from $50 to $20.  However, most of us would have trouble saying that proves the&lt;br /&gt;former was as risky as the latter.&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock that over a few years goes from $20 to $80 in a straight line will be described as low&lt;br /&gt;in risk, but if it suddenly declines from $80 to $50 it will be said to have become more risky.&lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to think of a given stock as riskier at $50 than it was shortly before at $80.&lt;br /&gt;Generally, those who equate volatility with risk look to the historic volatility of an asset as&lt;br /&gt;the indicator of its future risk.  But most of us know the future will not necessarily be like the&lt;br /&gt;past.  And one good way to add value in the i&lt;br /&gt;nvestment process is by predicting changes in&lt;br /&gt;riskiness, whereas no value is ever added through extrapolation.&lt;br /&gt;For all of these reasons, I find it hard to accept volatility as a comprehensive, sufficient or &lt;br /&gt;highly useful measure of risk. &lt;br /&gt;2BUIf Not Volatility, Then What? &lt;br /&gt;Rather than volatility, I think people decline to make investments primarily because they’re &lt;br /&gt;worried about a loss of capital or an unacceptably low return.  To me, “I need mo&lt;br /&gt;re upside &lt;br /&gt;potential because I’m afraid I could lose money” makes an awful lot more sense than “I need &lt;br /&gt;more upside potential because I’m afraid the price may fluctuate.”  No, I’m sure “risk” is – first &lt;br /&gt;and foremost – the likelihood of losing money. &lt;br /&gt;There are other kinds of risk, most of which affect each of us differently.  That means they’re &lt;br /&gt;subjective and personal – rather than intrinsic to the investment itself – and thus they’re unlikely &lt;br /&gt;to be behind the market prices set by the consensus of investors.  Here are a few: &lt;br /&gt;Falling short of one’s goal – Investors have differing needs, and for each investor the failure&lt;br /&gt;to meet those needs poses a risk.  A retired executive may need 4% per year to pay his bills,&lt;br /&gt;whereas 6% would represent a windfall.  But for a pension fund that has to average 8% per&lt;br /&gt;year, a prolonged period returning 6% would entail serious risk.  Obviously this risk is&lt;br /&gt;personal and subjective, as opposed to absolute and objective.  A given investment may be&lt;br /&gt;risky in this regard for some people but riskless for others.  Thus this cannot be the risk for&lt;br /&gt;which “the market” demands compensation in the form of higher prospective returns.&lt;br /&gt;Underperformance – Let’s say an investment manager knows she can’t get more money from&lt;br /&gt;a client no matter how well she does, but she’s sure she’ll lose the account if she fails to keep&lt;br /&gt;up with some index.  That’s “benchmark risk,” and she can eliminate it by emulating the&lt;br /&gt;index.  But every investor who’s unwilling to throw in the towel on outperformance, and who&lt;br /&gt;chooses to deviate from the index in its pursuit, will have periods of significant&lt;br /&gt;underperformance.  In fact, since many of the best investors stick most strongly to their&lt;br /&gt;approach – and since no approach will work all the time – the best investors can have some&lt;br /&gt;of the greatest periods of underperformance.  Specifically, in crazy times, disciplined&lt;br /&gt;investors willingly accept the risk of not taking enough risk to keep up.   (See Warren Buffett&lt;br /&gt;in 1999.  That year, underperformance was a badge of courage, because it denoted a refusal&lt;br /&gt;to participate in the tech bubble.)&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career risk – This is the extreme form of underperformance risk.  Dean LeBaron of&lt;br /&gt;Batterymarch wrote an article that cited “agency risk,” or the risk that arises when the people&lt;br /&gt;who manage money and the people whose money it is are different people.  In those cases,&lt;br /&gt;the managers may not care much about gains, in which they won’t share, but may be deathly&lt;br /&gt;afraid of losses that could cost them their jobs.  The implication is clear: risk that could&lt;br /&gt;jeopardize return to an agent’s firing point is rarely worth taking.&lt;br /&gt;Unconventionality – Along similar lines, there’s the risk of being different.  Everyone who&lt;br /&gt;aspires to superior results has to be mindful of John Maynard Keynes’s observation:&lt;br /&gt;"Worldly wisdom&lt;br /&gt; teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed&lt;br /&gt;unconventionally . . ."  Understandably, stewards of other people’s money can be more&lt;br /&gt;comfortable turning in average performance, regardless of where it stands in absolute terms,&lt;br /&gt;than with the possibility that unconventional actions will prove unsuccessful and get them&lt;br /&gt;fired.  As David Swenson wrote in his excellent book, “Pioneering Portfolio Management,”&lt;br /&gt;. . . active management strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from &lt;br /&gt;institutions, creating a paradox that few can unravel.  Establishing and &lt;br /&gt;maintaining an unconventional investment profile requires acceptance of &lt;br /&gt;uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which frequently appear downright &lt;br /&gt;imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom. &lt;br /&gt;Concern over this risk keeps many people from superior results, but it also creates &lt;br /&gt;opportunities in unorthodox investments for those who dare to be different.   &lt;br /&gt;Illiquidity – If an investor needs money with which to pay for surgery in three months or buy&lt;br /&gt;a home in a year, he may be unable to make an investment that can’t be counted on for&lt;br /&gt;liquidity that meets his schedule.  Thus, for him, risk isn’t just losing money or volatility, or&lt;br /&gt;any of the above.  It’s being unable when needed to turn an investment into cash at a&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price.  This, too, is a personal risk.  Theoretically, a fund whose life is perpetual&lt;br /&gt;and whose liquidity needs are predictable shouldn’t be sensitive to this risk and thus should&lt;br /&gt;be able to bear it for profit.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that investment risk comes in many forms.  Many risks matter to some &lt;br /&gt;investors but not to others, and they may make a given investment seem safe for some investors &lt;br /&gt;but risky for others.  Rejecting risk as synonymous with volatility, as I do, eliminates the one &lt;br /&gt;measure of risk that’s entirely quantifiable, objective and absolute.  This, in turn, makes it &lt;br /&gt;hard to argue that the market’s an efficient machine that precisely assesses the risk of each &lt;br /&gt;investment and allocates prospective return proportionately. &lt;br /&gt;3BUMeasuring Risk Prospectively &lt;br /&gt;I’m sure we agree that investors should and do demand higher prospective returns on riskier &lt;br /&gt;investments.  And hopefully we can agree that losing money &lt;br /&gt;is the risk people care about most in &lt;br /&gt;demanding prospective returns, and thus in setting prices for investments.  An important question &lt;br /&gt;remains:  How do they measure that risk? &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it clearly is nothing but a matter of opinion: hopefully an educated, skillful estimate&lt;br /&gt;about the future, but still just an estimate.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the standard for quantification is nonexistent.  With regard to a given investment,&lt;br /&gt;some people will think the risk is high and others will think it’s low.  Some will state it as the&lt;br /&gt;probability of not making money, and some as the probability of losing a given fraction of&lt;br /&gt;their money (and so forth).  Some will think of it as the risk of losing money over one year,&lt;br /&gt;and some as the risk of losing money over the entire holding period.  Clearly, even if all the&lt;br /&gt;investors involved met in a room and showed their cards, they’d never agree on a single&lt;br /&gt;number representing an investment’s riskiness.  And even if they could, that number&lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t likely be capable of being compared against another number, set by another group&lt;br /&gt;of investors, for another investment.&lt;br /&gt;Third, risk is deceptive.  Conventional considerations are easy to factor in, like the likelihood&lt;br /&gt;that normally recurring events will recur.  But freakish, once-in-a-lifetime events are&lt;br /&gt;impossible to quantify or prepare for.  The fact that an investment is susceptib&lt;br /&gt;le to a&lt;br /&gt;particularly serious risk that will occur infrequently if at all – what I call the “improbable&lt;br /&gt;disaster” – means it can seem safer than it really is.  As Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote in&lt;br /&gt;“Fooled by Randomness,”&lt;br /&gt;Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette.  First, it delivers the fatal bullet &lt;br /&gt;rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of &lt;br /&gt;chambers instead of six.  After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence &lt;br /&gt;of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. . . .  Second, unlike a well-&lt;br /&gt;defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone &lt;br /&gt;capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of &lt;br /&gt;reality. . . .  One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette – and &lt;br /&gt;calling it by some alternative “low risk” name. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that, looked at prospectively, much of risk is subjective, hidden and &lt;br /&gt;unquantifiable.  But I think one of the most interesting aspects of risk – and one of the &lt;br /&gt;least appreciated – is the fact that it isn’t quantifiable even in retrospect. &lt;br /&gt;4BUMeasuring Risk After the Fact &lt;br /&gt;Let’s say someone makes an investment that works out as expected (or better).  Does that mean it &lt;br /&gt;wasn’t risky?  Or let’s say the investment produces a loss.  Does that mean it was risky?  Or that &lt;br /&gt;it should have been perceived as risky at the time it was analyzed and entered into? &lt;br /&gt;If you think about it, the response to these questions is simple:  The fact that something &lt;br /&gt;happened doesn’t mean it was likely, and the fact that something didn’t happen doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;mean it was improbable.  Improbable things happen all the time, just as likely things often &lt;br /&gt;fail to occur. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb’s book is the bible on this subject as far as I’m concerned, and in it he talks about the &lt;br /&gt;“alternative histories” that could have unfolded but didn’t.  Alexander the Great mapped out his &lt;br /&gt;battle strategy, and it succeeded under the circumstances that unfolded.  But were those &lt;br /&gt;circumstances predictabl&lt;br /&gt;e or just a matter of chance?  Thus was Alexander wise to count on them &lt;br /&gt;or foolhardy?  And did he prudently anticipate and plan for them, or did he overlook them and &lt;br /&gt;just get lucky?  Lastly, was there a much wiser general somewhere else, who more &lt;br /&gt;systematically considered the possibilities and whose plan was more likely to work, but who fell &lt;br /&gt;victim to bad fortune (and thus anonymity) when random events conspired against him?  Which &lt;br /&gt;man deserves to be in the history books: Alexander the Great or Bob the Unlucky? &lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful way this is to look at things!  How many people do you suspect of having &lt;br /&gt;succeeded despite themselves, rather than because  of skill?  How many bear out the adage “it’s &lt;br /&gt;better to be lucky than good”?  Certainly many in business have derived fame and fortune from &lt;br /&gt;being right once in a row.  Was it skill or luck?  Can they do it again?  Did they accurately assess &lt;br /&gt;the risk?  Who can tell?  Who cares? &lt;br /&gt;In the investing world, one can live for years off one great coup or one extreme but eventually &lt;br /&gt;accurate forecast.  But what’s proved by one success?  When markets are boom&lt;br /&gt;ing, the best &lt;br /&gt;results often go to those who take the most risk.  Were they smart to anticipate good times and &lt;br /&gt;bulk up on beta, or just congenitally aggressive types who were bailed out by events?  Most &lt;br /&gt;simply put, how often in our business are people right for the wrong reason?  These are the &lt;br /&gt;people Taleb calls “lucky idiots,” and in the short run it’s certainly hard to tell them from skilled &lt;br /&gt;investors. &lt;br /&gt;The point is that even after an investment has been closed out, it’s impossible to tell how &lt;br /&gt;much risk&lt;br /&gt; it entailed.  Certainly the fact that an investment worked doesn’t mean it wasn’t &lt;br /&gt;risky, and vice versa.  With regard to a successful investment, where do you look to learn &lt;br /&gt;whether the favorable outcome was inescapable or just one of a hundred possibilities (many of &lt;br /&gt;them unpleasant)?  And ditto for a loser: how do we ascertain whether it was a reasonable but ill-&lt;br /&gt;fated venture, or just a wild stab that deserved to be punished? &lt;br /&gt;Did the investor do a good job of assessing the risk entailed?  That’s another good question that’s &lt;br /&gt;hard to answer.  Need a model?  Think of the weatherman.  He says there’s a 70% chance of rain &lt;br /&gt;tomorrow.  It rains; was he right or wrong?  Or it doesn’t rain; was he right or wrong?  It’s &lt;br /&gt;impossible to assess the accuracy of probability estimates other than zero and 100 except over a &lt;br /&gt;very large number of trials. &lt;br /&gt;The celebrated investor is one whose actions yielded good results.  Was she lucky or good?  &lt;br /&gt;How much risk did she take?  Since it’s risk-adjusted return that counts, can we tell &lt;br /&gt;whether her return was more than commensurate with the risks borne or less than &lt;br /&gt;commensurate?  I’m confident that the answers lie in skilled, subjective judgments, not &lt;br /&gt;highly precise but largely irrelevant ratios of return to volatility. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5BUSo Is It Risky Or Not? &lt;br /&gt;6BCasual onlookers rarely see that as a tough question.  But like most aspects of investing, the &lt;br /&gt;more obvious the answers seem, the less likely they are to be true.   &lt;br /&gt;7BMany considerations on the subject of risk are actually paradoxical.  Investing requires us to deal &lt;br /&gt;with the future, and the difficulty of cracking the future is the source of most of the risk.  The &lt;br /&gt;actual riskiness of many aspects of investing depends on the extent to which an investor is &lt;br /&gt;capable of knowing something about the future, or – perhaps better put – of knowing more than &lt;br /&gt;the average investor.   &lt;br /&gt;8BFor example, let’s consider diversification versus concentration.  Is concentration risky?  Not &lt;br /&gt;if you know what the future holds.  Diversification by definition implies a willingness to trad&lt;br /&gt;off return for safety, motivated by acceptance of the fact that knowledge of the future is &lt;br /&gt;imperfect.  Most investors rank their stocks by potential return, formally or informally, but no &lt;br /&gt;one I know buys just the one they expect to deliver the highest return.  Why?  Because they &lt;br /&gt;know their rankings might be wrong and don’t want to bet it all on black and see red come up.  &lt;br /&gt;Concentration is risky for investors who can’t see the future with much clarity, but it wouldn’t be &lt;br /&gt;for one who can.  For the latter, it’s the way to maximize performance, and diversification can &lt;br /&gt;hold it back. &lt;br /&gt;e &lt;br /&gt;What about illiquidity?  Conventional wisdom says liquid investments are safer than illiquid &lt;br /&gt;ones.  And small holdings are safer than large blocks.  So what’s up with Warren Buffett and &lt;br /&gt;Charlie Munger?  They regularly amass stock positions for which there are no other buyers.  And &lt;br /&gt;in fact, they seem to be more comfortable owning whole companies than public stocks they &lt;br /&gt;could sell off.  Yet their record continues to be highly superior.  The answer lies in the fact that &lt;br /&gt;they know what they’re doing.  They’re able to tell good companies from bad ones, and when the &lt;br /&gt;price is right.  And given that their portfolios are unlikely to go into forced liquidation (and as far &lt;br /&gt;as I know, they don’t think about losing their jobs), illiquidity isn’t a risk they worry about. &lt;br /&gt;9BFinally, what about buying risky assets?  People ask me all the time to answer a simple question: &lt;br /&gt;“Are Bruce Karsh’s distressed debt funds risky?”  They certainly are, in that he buys the debt of &lt;br /&gt;troubled and ultimately insolvent companies; the promises of interest and principal payments on &lt;br /&gt;the debt he buys invariably are out the window; the range of possible outcomes is extremely &lt;br /&gt;wide; his holdings are often illiquid; and he diversifies far less than Sheldon Stone does in his &lt;br /&gt;high yield bond portfolios.  On the other hand, Bruce often buys in at extremely low prices; he &lt;br /&gt;has a lot of experience and a highly skilled team; and the record suggests that he, too, knows &lt;br /&gt;what he’s doing.  Thus one might conclude Bruce’s funds aren’t risky, and the results to date &lt;br /&gt;support this view: in seventeen years he hasn’t had a fund that lost money or a year when the &lt;br /&gt;aggregate return of his funds was negative.  (Of course, this historic record says nothing about &lt;br /&gt;future performance.)  You can be the judge, but a lot will depend on your definition of risk. &lt;br /&gt;10BSo my answer’s the same here:  There’s no right answer.  No one number can tell you how &lt;br /&gt;much risk an investor took, or how much risk a prospective investment entails.  Few investment &lt;br /&gt;assets, strategies or tools are risky or safe in and of themselves.  And no answer on this subject is &lt;br /&gt;likely to hold true for every investor and every potential application.   That’s one of the reasons &lt;br /&gt;why investing is never easy . . . but always interesting. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11BUComplexity in Risk Assessment &lt;br /&gt;It is my purpose in this section to highlight a few reasons why risk assessment is not simply a &lt;br /&gt;matter of one number (as implied by the attention paid to volatility), but multi-dimensional &lt;br /&gt;instead.  Rick Funston of Deloitte pointed out in our board briefing materials that risk assessment &lt;br /&gt;requires us to deal with four complicating factors: &lt;br /&gt;Scenarios&lt;br /&gt;Offsets&lt;br /&gt;Correlations&lt;br /&gt;Domino effects&lt;br /&gt;By “scenarios,” Rick refers to alternative or abnormal future scenarios that go beyond the normal &lt;br /&gt;range of outcomes – in his words, “the possible but unusual.” &lt;br /&gt;“Offsets” translate in the investment world into something very familiar: diversification.  &lt;br /&gt;Intelligent diversification means not just investing in a bunch of different things, but in things &lt;br /&gt;that respond differently to the same factors.  In a well-diversified portfolio, something that &lt;br /&gt;negatively influences investment A might have a positive and offsetting influence on investment &lt;br /&gt;B. &lt;br /&gt;“Correlations” are somewhat the opposite.  The term refers to the chance that a number of &lt;br /&gt;investments will respond&lt;br /&gt; in the same way to a given factor.  Be alert, however, to the fact that &lt;br /&gt;when things in the environment turn really negative, seemingly unconnected investments can be &lt;br /&gt;similarly affected.  “In times of panic,” they say, “all correlations go to one.” &lt;br /&gt;Finally, “domino effects” refer to the likelihood that a given factor will cause trouble for &lt;br /&gt;investment A, which will be a problem for investm&lt;br /&gt;ent B, which will hurt investment C, and so &lt;br /&gt;on.  Obviously, domino effects can result in combinations that are bigger than any one issue &lt;br /&gt;alone and quite hard to anticipate. &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, because of these factors among so many others, risk can’t be reduced to a single number &lt;br /&gt;or handled simp&lt;br /&gt;listically.  Because of its multi-dimensional nature, it can only be dealt with by &lt;br /&gt;skilled and experienced individuals making judgments that are by their nature subjective.  And &lt;br /&gt;even those individuals must always be conscious of how much they don’t know. &lt;br /&gt;When the emerging markets melted down in 1998, accompanied by the collapse of Long Term &lt;br /&gt;Capital Management and the crisis in Russia, most investors thought their risk was limited to &lt;br /&gt;their holdings of emerging market securities.  But they soon saw firsthand the ability to be &lt;br /&gt;affected through the stocks of U.S. companies doing business in emerging markets, high yield &lt;br /&gt;bond funds that had dabbled in sovereign debt, and private equity investments exposed to the &lt;br /&gt;economies in question.   &lt;br /&gt;Fault lines run through every portfolio, adding to the complexity of managing risk.  It’s &lt;br /&gt;hard to anticipate all of them, but trying to do so lies at the heart of effective risk management.  &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12BUBring in the Risk Management Professionals &lt;br /&gt;Given the myriad reservations about risk measurement expressed above, I want to inveigh &lt;br /&gt;against over-reliance on using outside “experts” to assess the risk the investment people are &lt;br /&gt;taking, and on m&lt;br /&gt;odels like VAR (value at risk) to do the assessing. &lt;br /&gt;First of all, given the inextricable linkage between analyzing a potential investment and assessing &lt;br /&gt;its risks, I question whether anyone else can know as much about this subject as the investment &lt;br /&gt;professionals directly involved.  To me, “risk measurement officers” sound like armchair &lt;br /&gt;quarterbacks who’re brought in to tell the investment pros how they’re doing (although I concede &lt;br /&gt;that they may be useful in looking across the “silos” in multi-strategy portfolios to aggregate risk &lt;br /&gt;and look for fault lines). &lt;br /&gt;Second, I sincerely doubt that the risks that really matter are subject to modeling.  Models can &lt;br /&gt;tell us what will happen most of the time, and how much risk will be entailed under “normal &lt;br /&gt;circumstances.”  But, as my friend Ric Kayne says, everyone understands the things that happen &lt;br /&gt;within two standard deviations, but everything important in financial history takes place outside &lt;br /&gt;of two standard deviations. &lt;br /&gt;Rick Funston performs a service by organizing risks into two categories: those that are suitable &lt;br /&gt;for probabilistic modeling and those that aren’t.  He includes among the elements that render a &lt;br /&gt;risk suitable for modeling (1) recurring situations, (2) processes that are subject to known rules, &lt;br /&gt;(3) conditions that can be counted on to remain stable, (4) controllable environments, (5) a&lt;br /&gt;limited range of outcomes, and (6) certainty that combinations of things will lead to known&lt;br /&gt;results.  What could be &lt;br /&gt;UlessU descriptive of investing?&lt;br /&gt;Given the non-recurring situations we face, the fact that many of the rules are unknown, &lt;br /&gt;and the largely unlimited range of outcomes (among other things), I would argue strongly &lt;br /&gt;that models and modelers are of very limited utility in measuring investment risk at the &lt;br /&gt;extremes, where it really matters. &lt;br /&gt;13BUBearing Risk for Profit &lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, one of my memos quoted Lord Keynes as having said, “. . . a speculator is one &lt;br /&gt;who runs risks of which he is aware and an investor is one who runs risks of which he is &lt;br /&gt;unaware.”  (I admitted at the time&lt;br /&gt; that I’d been unable to verify that he actually said it, but now &lt;br /&gt;I’ve identified the source.)  Keynes makes an essential point.  Bearing risk unknowingly can be &lt;br /&gt;a huge mistake, but it’s what those who buy the securities that are all the rage and most highly &lt;br /&gt;esteemed at a particular point in time – to which “nothing bad can possibly happen” – repeatedly &lt;br /&gt;do.  On the other hand, the intelligent acceptance of recognized risk for profit underlies &lt;br /&gt;some of the wisest, most profitable investments – even though (or perhaps due to the fact that) &lt;br /&gt;most investors dismiss them as dangerous speculations.  &lt;br /&gt;I believe in the principles underlying the Capital Market approach.  We are (or should be) risk &lt;br /&gt;averse, meaning that, if the prospective returns are equal, we prefer safer investments to the mo&lt;br /&gt;re &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;risky.  Thus, we must be induced to make riskier investments by the offer of higher prospective &lt;br /&gt;returns.  We could accept the risk-free rate available on Treasury bills, but most of us choose &lt;br /&gt;instead to strive for more by taking on incremental risk.  When you boil it all dow&lt;br /&gt;n, it’s the &lt;br /&gt;investor’s job to intelligently bear risk for profit.  Doing it well is what separates the pros &lt;br /&gt;from the rest. &lt;br /&gt;What does it mean to intelligently bear risk for profit?  I’ll provide an example.  In the early &lt;br /&gt;1980s, a reporter asked me, “How ca&lt;br /&gt;n you invest in high yield bonds when you know some of &lt;br /&gt;the issuers will go bankrupt?”  Somehow, the perfect answer came to me in a flash: “The most &lt;br /&gt;conservative companies in America are the life insurance companies.  How can they insure &lt;br /&gt;people’s lives when they know they’re UallU going to die?”  Both activities involve conscious risk &lt;br /&gt;bearing.  Both can be done intelligently (or not).  The ability to profit from them consistently &lt;br /&gt;depends on the approach employed and whether it’s done skillfully.  For companies selling life &lt;br /&gt;insurance, I said, the keys to survival and profitability are the following: &lt;br /&gt;It’s risk they’re aware of.  They know everyone’s going to die.  Thus they factor this reality&lt;br /&gt;into their approach.&lt;br /&gt;It’s risk they can analyze.  That’s why they have doctors assess applicants’ health.&lt;br /&gt;It’s risk they can diversify.  By ensuring a mix of policyholders by age, gender, occupation&lt;br /&gt;and location, they make sure they’re not exposed to freak occurrences and widespread losses.&lt;br /&gt;And it’s risk they can be sure they’re well paid to bear.  They set premiums so they’ll&lt;br /&gt;make a profit if the policyholders die according to the actuarial tables on average.  And if the&lt;br /&gt;insurance market is inefficient – for example, if the company can sell a policy to someone&lt;br /&gt;likely to die at age 80 at a premium that assumes he’ll die at 70 – they’ll be better protected&lt;br /&gt;against risk and positioned for exceptional profits if things go as expected.&lt;br /&gt;We do exactly the same things in high yield bonds, and in the rest of Oaktree’s strategies.  We &lt;br /&gt;try to be aware of the risks, which is essential given how much our work involves assets that &lt;br /&gt;some&lt;br /&gt; simplistically call “risky.”  We employ highly skilled professionals capable of analyzing &lt;br /&gt;investments and assessing risk.  We diversify our portfolios appropriately.  And we invest only &lt;br /&gt;when we’re convinced the likely return far more than compensates for the risk. &lt;br /&gt;We’ve said for years that risky assets can make for good investments if they’re cheap &lt;br /&gt;enough.  The essential element is knowing when that’s the case.  That’&lt;br /&gt;s it: the intelligent &lt;br /&gt;bearing of risk for profit, the best test for which is a record of repeated success over a long &lt;br /&gt;period of time. &lt;br /&gt;14BURisk Management vs. Risk Avoidance &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, Oaktree doesn’t run from risk.  We welcome it at the right time, in the right instances, &lt;br /&gt;and at the right price.  We could easily avoid all risk, and so could you.  But we’d be assured of &lt;br /&gt;avoiding returns above the risk-free rate as well.  Will Rogers said, “&lt;br /&gt;TYou've got to go out on a &lt;br /&gt;limb sometimes because that's where the fruit is.”  None of us is in this business to make 4%. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSo even though the first tenet in Oaktree’s investment philosophy stresses “the importance &lt;br /&gt;of risk control,” this has nothing to do with risk avoidance.   &lt;br /&gt;TIt’s by bearing risk when we’re well paid to do so – and especially by taking risks toward which &lt;br /&gt;others are averse in the extreme – that we strive to add value for our clients.  When formulated &lt;br /&gt;that way, it’s obvious how big a part risk plays in our process. &lt;br /&gt;Rick Funston said in the article that prompted this memo, “. . . you need comfort that the . . . &lt;br /&gt;risks and exposures are understood, appropriately managed, and made more transparent &lt;br /&gt;for everyone . . .  This is not risk aversion; it is risk intelligence.”  That’s what Oaktree &lt;br /&gt;strives for every day. &lt;br /&gt;January 19, 2006 &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Dare to Be Great &lt;br /&gt;In one of the most colorful vignettes of the early 1970s, Glenn Turner, the head of Koscot &lt;br /&gt;Interplanetary, would fly into a small Midwestern town in his Learjet (when that was a huge &lt;br /&gt;deal).  Two dwarfs would hop out and unroll a red carpet.  Turner would emerge under a banner &lt;br /&gt;reading “Dare to Be Great” and vacuum up money through a pyramid marketing scheme based &lt;br /&gt;on selling motivational tapes containing the secret of getting rich.  Turner’s long gone from the &lt;br /&gt;scene, but daring to be great still deserves our consideration, even in the absence of a &lt;br /&gt;surefire recipe for success. &lt;br /&gt;This memo stems from an accumulation of thoughts on the subject of how investment &lt;br /&gt;management clients might best pursue superior results.  Typically my thoughts pile up, and then &lt;br /&gt;something prompts me to turn them into a memo.  In this case, the impetus came while I read &lt;br /&gt;“Hedgehogging” by Barton Biggs.  I’ll come back to it later. &lt;br /&gt;How Can We Achieve Superior Investment Results?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The answer is simple: not only am I unaware of any formula that alone will lead to above &lt;br /&gt;average investment performance, but I’m convinced such a formula cannot exist.  According to &lt;br /&gt;one of my favorite sources of inspiration, the late John Kenneth Galbraith:  &lt;br /&gt;There is nothing reliable to be learned about making money.  If there were, study &lt;br /&gt;would be intense and everyone with a positive IQ would be rich. &lt;br /&gt;Of course there can’t be a roadmap to investment success.  First, the collective actions of those &lt;br /&gt;following the map would alter the landscape, rendering it ineffective.  And second, everyone &lt;br /&gt;following it would achieve the same results, and people would still look longingly at the top &lt;br /&gt;quartile . . . the route to which would have to be found through other means. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll make a few suggestions below on what investors should and shouldn’t do.  In the end, &lt;br /&gt;though, the things I suggest will be of little help without highly skilled implementation, and the &lt;br /&gt;results will depend almost entirely on that implementation and rather little on my suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;First, Get Out of Lake Wobegon&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nori Gerardo Lietz of Pension Consulting Alliance, in a paper on the performance of real estate &lt;br /&gt;opportunity funds, was the latest to remind me about Garrison Keillor’s fictional Lake Wobegon, &lt;br /&gt;where all the children are above average.  Investing, likewise, is a world where it seems &lt;br /&gt;everyone claims to be terrific and can back it up with performance data.  Especially in &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alternative investing areas such as real estate and private equity, the managers make it sound like &lt;br /&gt;they’ve done great.  But the long-term average returns in mo&lt;br /&gt;st such areas have been lackluster, &lt;br /&gt;and many managers’ records are inconsistent.  One of my favorite quotes came from “Dandy &lt;br /&gt;Don” Meredith while announcing on Monday Night Football: “They don’t make ‘em anymore &lt;br /&gt;the way they used to,” he said, “but then again they never did.”  Rarely are the real records as &lt;br /&gt;good as the ones people (and especially the managers who created them) fondly remember. &lt;br /&gt;Take a look at the performance over time in venture capital, buyouts and real estate and you’ll &lt;br /&gt;see results for the median manager that are far from exciting.  Professor Steven Kaplan, head of &lt;br /&gt;the entrepreneurial studies department at the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of &lt;br /&gt;Business, authored a paper showing that a dollar invested in the totality of buyout funds between &lt;br /&gt;1980 and 1997 did no better than a dollar invested in the S&amp;P 500.  And that was despite the fact &lt;br /&gt;that the buyout funds were leveraged in a rising equity market and the S&amp;P wasn’t.   &lt;br /&gt;The eye-popping results of the funds at the top of the performance range draw money &lt;br /&gt;magnetically to alternative investment areas, while the average return usually deserves a big &lt;br /&gt;yawn.  For superior results, it’s absolutely essential to invest with superior managers. &lt;br /&gt;My old boss at Citibank, Peter Vermilye, is famous for saying that only 5% of analysts add &lt;br /&gt;value.  That’s probably true as well of portfolio managers, consultants and investment &lt;br /&gt;committees and their members.  (Of course you and I are in that 5%, but I have my doubts about &lt;br /&gt;the others.)   &lt;br /&gt;The consensus opinion of market participants is baked into market prices. Thus, if investors lack &lt;br /&gt;insight that is superior to the average of the people who make up the consensus, they should &lt;br /&gt;expect average risk-adjusted performance.  Few people are able to consistently identify cases &lt;br /&gt;where the market price is wrong and act on them to their advantage.  “But how about Peter &lt;br /&gt;Lynch?” people respond.  That’s just the point.  His singular reputation is proof how rare the &lt;br /&gt;Peter Lynches are.  As my mother used to say, it’s the exception that proves the rule. &lt;br /&gt;So, the first job in trying to access superior performance consists of getting in with the best funds &lt;br /&gt;and managers.  Everyone wants above-average results, but far from everyone can achieve them.  &lt;br /&gt;(Of course, the chore is complicated by the fact that the investment capacity of superior &lt;br /&gt;investment vehicles is limited, and the inrush of money can itself render them less superior, since &lt;br /&gt;the cost of investing will be pushed up as the money arrives.) &lt;br /&gt;Escape From the Crowd&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This just in: you can’t take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform.  &lt;br /&gt;The search for superior results has to lead to the unusual, perhaps the idiosyncratic.  Take &lt;br /&gt;manager selection.   &lt;br /&gt;Above-average managers aren’t easy to find.  When you choose on the basis of a manager’s &lt;br /&gt;track record, it’s the same record that everyone else sees.  In order to make superior choices, &lt;br /&gt;clients have to do in-depth analysis; get to know more than the record, reputation and printed &lt;br /&gt;word; fully understand managers’ approaches; make judgment calls based on that knowledge; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and take chances.  Especially as to that last point, unusual success cannot lie in doing the &lt;br /&gt;obvious.  Two specific examples: &lt;br /&gt;•New managers – Someone has to fund them (o&lt;br /&gt;r else they’ll never become established&lt;br /&gt;managers).  But clearly that decision can’t be based on reams of data.  It involves making a&lt;br /&gt;bet on people and their investment approaches.  Hiring new managers can pay off very well&lt;br /&gt;. . . when it’s done right.&lt;br /&gt;•Underperforming managers – Retain or fire . . . or add money?  That’s the real question.&lt;br /&gt;Good investors hold fast to their approach and discipline.  But every approach goes out of&lt;br /&gt;favor from time to time, and the manager who adheres most firmly can do the worst.  (Page&lt;br /&gt;217 of the book “Hedgehogging” provides fascinating data on some great managers’ terrible&lt;br /&gt;times.)  A lagging year or two doesn’t make a manager a bad one . . . maybe just one whose&lt;br /&gt;market niche has been in the process of getting cheap.  But how often are managers given&lt;br /&gt;more money when they’re in a slump (as opposed to being fired)?&lt;br /&gt;Buck the Trend&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As in manager selection, bucking the trend is a key element in all aspects of the pursuit of &lt;br /&gt;superior investment results.  First, going along with the crowd will, by definition, lead to average &lt;br /&gt;performance.  Second, the crowd is usually in broad agreement – and wrong – at the extremes.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s what creates the extremes (and the highly profitable recoveries therefrom).  But going &lt;br /&gt;against the crowd isn’t easy.  As Yale’s David Swensen puts it,  &lt;br /&gt;Establishing and maintaining an unconventional investment profile requires &lt;br /&gt;acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which frequently appear &lt;br /&gt;downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom. &lt;br /&gt;Non-consensus ideas have to be lonely.  By definition, non-consensus ideas that are popular, &lt;br /&gt;widely held or intuitively obvious are an oxymoron.  Thus such ideas are uncomfortable; non-&lt;br /&gt;conformists don’t enjoy the warmth that comes with being at the center of the herd.   &lt;br /&gt;Further, unconventional ideas often appear imprudent.  The popular definition of “prudent” – &lt;br /&gt;especially in the investment world – is often twisted into “what everyone does.”  When courts &lt;br /&gt;interpret Prudent Man laws, they take them to mean “what most intelligent, careful people would &lt;br /&gt;do under those circumstances.”  But many of the things that have worked out best over the &lt;br /&gt;years – betting on start-ups, buying the debt of bankrupt companies, shorting the stocks of &lt;br /&gt;world-altering tech companies – looked downright imprudent to the masses at the time.  (If &lt;br /&gt;they weren’t so out of favor, they couldn’t have been implemented at such advantageous &lt;br /&gt;prices and produced such huge returns.) &lt;br /&gt;Bucking the trend does not have to be synonymous with taking a lot of investment risk.  In fact, &lt;br /&gt;it’s following the crowd that’s risky, since the crowd’s actions take security prices to such &lt;br /&gt;extremes. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying away from tech stocks in the late 1990s meant refusing to pay ridiculously high prices.  &lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t risky in fundamental terms, but in that it required daring to be different.  Those who &lt;br /&gt;moved to underweight tech stocks when they first became overpriced were on the hot seat for a &lt;br /&gt;long time.  I don’t think any other stock group in history has done as well as the techs in the late &lt;br /&gt;1990s, and the 1999 divergence between growth stock returns and value stock returns was the &lt;br /&gt;greatest ever.  In the years leading up to March 2000, lots of managers were fired for having &lt;br /&gt;underweighted tech stocks.  That didn’t make them wrong – just too early.  While it wasn’t easy &lt;br /&gt;for them to stick to their guns – or for their clients to stay with them – it sure paid off. &lt;br /&gt;Unconventionality&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unconventionality is required for superior investment results, especially in asset allocation.  As I &lt;br /&gt;mentioned above, you can’t do the same things others do and expect to outperform.   &lt;br /&gt;Unconventionality shouldn’t be a goal in itself, but rather a way of thinking.  In order to &lt;br /&gt;distinguish yourself from others, it helps to have ideas that are different and to process those &lt;br /&gt;ideas differently.  I conceptualize the situation as a simple 2-by-2 matrix: &lt;br /&gt;Of course it’s not easy and clear-cut, but I think that’s the general situation.  If your behavior and &lt;br /&gt;that of your managers is conventional, you’re likely to get conventional results – either good or &lt;br /&gt;bad.  Only if the behavior is unconventional is your performance likely to be &lt;br /&gt;unconventional . . . and only if the judgments are superior is your performance likely to be &lt;br /&gt;above average. &lt;br /&gt;Contrarian investing, which is akin to unconventional investing, has been behind many of the &lt;br /&gt;greatest successes.  But that’s not the same as saying all contrarian decisions are successful.  As &lt;br /&gt;is the case with unconventionality, you should not aim for contrarianism for its own sake, but &lt;br /&gt;only when the reasons are good and the actions of the crowd look particularly foolish.  If your &lt;br /&gt;actions aren’t founded on solid logic, (a) they’re unlikely to work consistently, and (b) when the &lt;br /&gt;going gets tough, you might find it hard to hold on through the lows.  David Swensen puts it well &lt;br /&gt;in his book, “Pioneering Portfolio Management”: &lt;br /&gt;Contrarian, long-term investing poses extraordinary challenges under the best of &lt;br /&gt;circumstances. . . .  Unfortunately, overcoming the tendency to follow the crowd, &lt;br /&gt;while necessary, proves insufficient to guarantee investment success. . . .  While &lt;br /&gt;courage to take a different path enhances chances for success, investors face &lt;br /&gt;likely failure unless a thoughtful set of investment principles undergirds the &lt;br /&gt;courage.     &lt;br /&gt;Conventional &lt;br /&gt;Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Unconventional &lt;br /&gt;Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Favorable  &lt;br /&gt;Outcomes &lt;br /&gt;Average good results  Above-average results &lt;br /&gt;Unfavorable &lt;br /&gt;Outcomes &lt;br /&gt;Average bad results   Below-average results &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to say Oaktree buys when people say “no way” and sells when they say “no sweat.”  We &lt;br /&gt;bought Tumi in 2002, when people believed that because of 9&lt;br /&gt;/11, nobody would ever travel &lt;br /&gt;again (or need luggage), and we sold it in 2004 when no one remembered having felt that way.  &lt;br /&gt;We gained control of Regal, Loews, Edwards and Landmark when people thought overexpansion &lt;br /&gt;had sounded the death knell for the movie exhibition industry, and we began to sell when &lt;br /&gt;industry capacity was rationalized and profitability rebounded.  We bought land in Chicago when &lt;br /&gt;everyone was sure there would never be another skyscraper built in the Loop, and we sold it &lt;br /&gt;when they decided more were in fact needed.  These transactions were highly profitable.   &lt;br /&gt;When someone says, “I wouldn’t buy that at any price,” it’s as illogical as, “I’ll take it regardless &lt;br /&gt;of price.”  The latter can get you killed (see Nifty-Fifty growth stocks in 1969 and tech stocks in &lt;br /&gt;1999), and the former can make you miss an opportunity.  When everyone’s eager to buy the &lt;br /&gt;same thing, it’s probably overpriced.  And when no one is willing to buy something, it’s equally &lt;br /&gt;likely to be underpriced. &lt;br /&gt;Be a Pioneer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my experience, many of the most successful investments have entailed being early.  That’s &lt;br /&gt;half the reason why I consider the greatest of all investment adages to be: “What the wise &lt;br /&gt;man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.” &lt;br /&gt;While there’s no surefire route to investment success, I do believe one of the easiest ways to &lt;br /&gt;make money is by buying things whose merits others haven’t yet discovered.  You ask, &lt;br /&gt;“When do you get that chance?”  Not often, (and certainly not easily today), but not never. &lt;br /&gt;In 1978, Bache asked Citibank to manage a new mutual fund for it.  Citibank turned the job over &lt;br /&gt;to me:  “There’s some guy named Milken or something who works for a small brokerage firm in &lt;br /&gt;California, issuing and trading high yield bonds.  Can you find out what that means?”   &lt;br /&gt;Few people had ever heard of high yield bonds.  There wasn’t much historic performance data, &lt;br /&gt;and what little there was came from a few obscure mutual funds.  Buying bonds with a &lt;br /&gt;meaningful probability of default certainly seemed imprudent.  Most institutional portfolios had &lt;br /&gt;an inviolate minimum credit rating for bonds of single-A or triple-B.  Corporate CEOs said, “My &lt;br /&gt;buddy’s company was just threatened by a corporate raider backed by junk bonds; our pension &lt;br /&gt;fund will never own any!”  And no public or union pension trustee wanted the headline risk &lt;br /&gt;associated with bankruptcy.  In other words, the perfect buying opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, our high yield bond portfolios have outperformed high grade bonds for two decades-plus, &lt;br /&gt;by more than enough to compensate for their defaults, volatility and illiquidity.  It’s been a long-&lt;br /&gt;term free lunch, and the earliest investors got the biggest helping.   &lt;br /&gt;Everyone craves market inefficiency, but most people are vague on what it means or where it &lt;br /&gt;comes from.  I’ve always thought a likely source can be a market niche that most people don’t &lt;br /&gt;know about, don’t understand and don’t feel comfortable with.  That certainly describes high &lt;br /&gt;yield bonds in 1978.  It helps to be a pioneer. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we were fortunate to turn to distressed debt in 1988.  There weren’t any distressed debt &lt;br /&gt;funds from mainstream financial institutions, &lt;br /&gt;and   the area was a little-known backwater.  What &lt;br /&gt;could be more unseemly – and less intuitively attractive – than investing in the debt of &lt;br /&gt;companies that are bankrupt or sure to become so?  Actually, what else could have been as &lt;br /&gt;profitable?  Distressed debt buyers have reaped high returns while enjoying the relative safety &lt;br /&gt;that comes with paying low prices, investing in asset-rich companies and deleveraging their &lt;br /&gt;capital structures. &lt;br /&gt;To take early advantage of areas like these, you have to put your faith in concepts and &lt;br /&gt;people, based on logical arguments and analyses but without the benefit of historic &lt;br /&gt;performance data.  That’s how you make the big bucks.   &lt;br /&gt;(Today, of course, everyone is willing to do anything to make money.  Moreover, everyone &lt;br /&gt;assumes that the more outré the concept, the more likely it is to produce high returns.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;today (a) few if any free lunches are available, and (b) risk-taking is likely to generate sub-par &lt;br /&gt;rewards.  That brings me to the second half of my favorite adage, regarding that which “the &lt;br /&gt;fool does in the end.”) &lt;br /&gt;Up Against the Institution&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Large investment management firms, pension funds, endowments, investment committees; &lt;br /&gt;they’re all institutions.  As such, they tend to engage in what is described as “institutional &lt;br /&gt;behavior” – an oft-heard phrase that’s rarely intended as a compliment.  We all know what’s &lt;br /&gt;implied: shared decision making, diffused responsibility, personal risk minimization, and go-&lt;br /&gt;along-to-get-along interaction.  All of these things work to discourage unconventionality, and &lt;br /&gt;thus to render superior investment results elusive. &lt;br /&gt;David Swensen takes direct aim at institutional behavior.  In fact, he makes repeated use of the &lt;br /&gt;word “institution,” as if invoking a negative mantra. &lt;br /&gt;. . . active management strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from &lt;br /&gt;institutions, creating a paradox that few can unravel.  (my personal favorite, &lt;br /&gt;emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;By operating in the institutional mainstream of short-horizon, uncontroversial &lt;br /&gt;opportunities, committee members and staff ensure unspectacular results, while &lt;br /&gt;missing potentially rewarding longer-term contrarian plays. &lt;br /&gt;Creating a governance process that encourages long-term, independent, contrarian &lt;br /&gt;investing poses an enormous challenge to endowed institutions. &lt;br /&gt;Whether the connotation has to be negative is unclear.  But certainly it is true that &lt;br /&gt;“idiosyncratic” and “unconventional” seem to go with “unusual investment results,” but &lt;br /&gt;probably not with “institutional” and “bureaucratic.”  I encourage everyone to examine the &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorts of behavior that characterize their organizations and see if anything can be changed to &lt;br /&gt;increase the likelihood of success. &lt;br /&gt;Committees&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t like being on committees.  I was on five of them at Citibank (before moving downward in &lt;br /&gt;the organization from Director of Research to just-plain portfolio manager in 1978), and thus I &lt;br /&gt;had eleven hours of meetings scheduled per week before I walked in the door each Monday &lt;br /&gt;morning.  I’ve always felt that committee meetings tend to last as long as the person who wants &lt;br /&gt;them to last the longest wants them to last.  Since that’s never me, they make me impatient &lt;br /&gt;(unless they’re doing really interesting stuff).  Oaktree generally doesn’t have committees, but &lt;br /&gt;it’s a matter of local option; our Principal Group works through investment committees that &lt;br /&gt;everyone seems happy with and that have produced great results. &lt;br /&gt;In “Hedgehogging,” under the heading “Groupthink Stinks,” Barton Biggs lists a number of the &lt;br /&gt;shortcomings of committees, borrowing from Yale psychologist Irving Janis.  He says these &lt;br /&gt;structures encourage: &lt;br /&gt;•collective rationalization of shared illusions generally believed,&lt;br /&gt;•negative stereotypes of out-of-favor groups, techniques and individuals,&lt;br /&gt;•unwarranted confidence in chosen approaches,&lt;br /&gt;•unanimity, suppression of doubts and pressure on dissenters,&lt;br /&gt;•docility on the part of individual members,&lt;br /&gt;•free-floating conversations during meetings, and&lt;br /&gt;•non-adherence to standardized methodologies.&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to believe that these elements are fostered in decision making groups.  And certainly &lt;br /&gt;they are undesirable and must be guarded against.  As Barton Biggs puts it,  &lt;br /&gt; . . . groups of intelligent people have so many inherent liabilities that a lone &lt;br /&gt;individual has a far better chance of making good decisions.  The collective &lt;br /&gt;intelligence of the group is surely less than the sum of its parts, and the more &lt;br /&gt;people on a committee, the less chance it has to be wise and crisp in its decision &lt;br /&gt;making. &lt;br /&gt;I’d rather say, “The collective intelligence of the group often is less than the intelligence of its &lt;br /&gt;one or two smartest members.”  By that I mean committees rarely aggregate the insights of their &lt;br /&gt;members; rather they tend to reflect the average insightfulness of their members. &lt;br /&gt;At Citibank in the mid-1970s, the senior-most panel, the Investment Policy Committee, would go &lt;br /&gt;off-site for semi-annual retreats.  The high point consisted of voting on which industries’ stocks &lt;br /&gt;would perform best over the coming year.   &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, the result was a bell-shaped curve. &lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;For others it was also bell-shaped, but with the placement of the industries reversed. &lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;Some saw only big winners and big losers. &lt;br /&gt;The bulls thought most would do average or better. &lt;br /&gt;The bears thought most would do average or worse. &lt;br /&gt;And the agnostics thought they’d all do about the same. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my sense that if you added up the members’ individual distributions of expected &lt;br /&gt;performance, you’d get a summary distribution that was pretty close to &lt;br /&gt;what would have been &lt;br /&gt;generated randomly, and one largely devoid of valuable information.  Certainly any unique &lt;br /&gt;insight that a member of the committee might have would be lost in such an aggregation process. &lt;br /&gt;Committees rarely take high-risk positions for which the members can be criticized.  They &lt;br /&gt;rarely embrace idiosyncratic opinions.  They rarely capture the most insightful member’s &lt;br /&gt;uniqueness, as expressed in a lone non-conformist viewpoint.  And thus they rarely produce &lt;br /&gt;highly superior investment results.  It’s not impossible, just against the odds.  Barton Biggs &lt;br /&gt;says the chances of its happening can be improved if one or two members seize more-than-equal &lt;br /&gt;power.  It’ll also help if it’s the right ones who do so. &lt;br /&gt;I think the key to successful committee efforts lies in “sparks.”  There should be intellectual &lt;br /&gt;friction capable of generating heat and light: spirited discussion leading to unique insight.  &lt;br /&gt;Professor Janis urges the leader to create an atmosphere that fosters “intellectual suspicion &lt;br /&gt;amidst personal trust.”  Barton Biggs suggests praising those who disagree with the trend; &lt;br /&gt;designating devil’s advocates; and holding second-chance meetings where members can take &lt;br /&gt;another, skeptical look at decisions the group has made.  He says, “harmonious, happy &lt;br /&gt;meetings may be a warning of groupthink and complacency, whereas agitation, passionate &lt;br /&gt;arguments and some stress are good signs.”  While these latter things are no guarantee of &lt;br /&gt;correct, unconventional decisions, such decisions may prove elusive without them. &lt;br /&gt;Agency Risk&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why don’t investing institutions strive for unconventionality as often as they should?  When they &lt;br /&gt;don’t dare to be great, why is that the case?  One reason is the limitations inherent in institutional &lt;br /&gt;behavior and committee decision making, as described above.  Another is agency risk. &lt;br /&gt;I first read about agency risk in 1983, in an article by Dean LeBaron of Batterymarch.  It’s risk &lt;br /&gt;that arises when agents are hired to do a job in lieu of their principals, and it arises because the &lt;br /&gt;agents’ motivations may diverge from those of the principals.  When you manage your own &lt;br /&gt;money, the decisions are made according to your view of what’s best for you.  When other &lt;br /&gt;people manage your money, the decisions may also be influenced by what’s best for them.  &lt;br /&gt;How many times have you heard a hired hand say, “It’s not worth my while to take that risk”? &lt;br /&gt;The most basic agency issue arises because staff and investment committee members may gain &lt;br /&gt;relatively little if their decisions are successful but can lose a lot (like their jobs and reputations) &lt;br /&gt;if the decisions are unsuccessful.  All else being equal, this can lead them to care more about &lt;br /&gt;limiting risk than about achieving gains.  (On the other hand, because hedge fund managers &lt;br /&gt;participate in profits but not losses, this can make them care more about achieving gains than &lt;br /&gt;about limiting risk.)   &lt;br /&gt;The litany of agency risks goes on, per David Swensen, “from trustees seeking to make an &lt;br /&gt;impact during their term on the investment committee, to portfolio managers pursuing steady fee &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;income at the expense of investment excellence, to corporate managers diverting assets for &lt;br /&gt;personal gain.” &lt;br /&gt;Whenever parties other than the owners are engaged in a process, there’s a chance that they will &lt;br /&gt;act (wittingly or unwittingly) in their own interests in addition to (or instead of) the interests of &lt;br /&gt;the owners.  This is inescapable, but not unmanageable.   &lt;br /&gt;The best way to deal with an issue is usually to put it on the table.  Sunlight is a great &lt;br /&gt;disinfectant.  All decision-making processes should recognize and take into consideration the &lt;br /&gt;factors influencing the decision makers.  Candid discussion is usually the first step. &lt;br /&gt;Another way to address the issue is through incentives, to which creative principals should pay a &lt;br /&gt;lot of attention.  An experienced director told Forbes in the early 1990s, “I’ve given up on trying &lt;br /&gt;to get people to do what I tell them to do; they do what I pay them to do.”  To the extent &lt;br /&gt;possible, people involved in the investment process should be able to look forward to rewards for &lt;br /&gt;attempts at nonconformity, not just penalties for decisions that don’t work.  That might be the &lt;br /&gt;best response to John Maynard Keynes’s observation: “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is &lt;br /&gt;better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”  &lt;br /&gt;Insist on Using Consultants Constructively&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Consultants are what you make of them.  They can bring expertise and data that only the largest &lt;br /&gt;of institutional investors can build internally.  They can introduce ideas they’re seeing in use &lt;br /&gt;elsewhere.  They can support investors’ efforts to innovate while making sure they don’t go so &lt;br /&gt;far as to endanger the corpus.  Because few institutions can afford to home-grow all of the &lt;br /&gt;resources that a good consultant has, consultants truly can be additive. &lt;br /&gt;Or, they can just be used as a source of cover.  Their stamp of approval can be sought as &lt;br /&gt;protection against potential criticism.  They can be used to ensure that the portfolio is never &lt;br /&gt;different enough from the herd to stand out.  They can be hired – and motivated – to preclude &lt;br /&gt;innovation.  Frighteningly, a consultant once told me, “I never initiate; if I did, I could be &lt;br /&gt;criticized for being wrong.  I just opine when asked.” &lt;br /&gt;By supplying new ideas and needed data in support of an effort to be great, consultants clearly &lt;br /&gt;can add value.  But left in bureaucratic mode, it is possible for them to contribute nothing other &lt;br /&gt;than protection.  The choice – of consultant and modus operandi – is up to the client. &lt;br /&gt;Recognize That All Investors Aren’t Created Equal&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if the rules in Las Vegas were changed so there would be winners but no &lt;br /&gt;losers?  Can’t capitalism allow some businesses to thrive without requiring that some fail?  Can’t &lt;br /&gt;we have survival of the fittest without the demise of the less fit?  Wouldn’t it be nice? &lt;br /&gt;And wouldn’t it be nice if everyone could make an equally positive contribution to &lt;br /&gt;investment results?  But they can’t.   &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment committee decisions can’t be improved by members possessing below average skill, &lt;br /&gt;experience and expertise.  The bottom 50% &lt;br /&gt;of the universe may help by giving the top &lt;br /&gt;participants a manager median they can beat, but they do not contribute to the pursuit of superior &lt;br /&gt;results for themselves or those who employ them. &lt;br /&gt;Some investment organizations are egalitarian and democratic.  Participation in the investment &lt;br /&gt;process is broad and diffuse.  Everyone gets a little money to manage, or everyone gets a vote.  &lt;br /&gt;This approach doesn’t appeal to me, because of my conviction that investment skill isn’t &lt;br /&gt;distributed evenly.   &lt;br /&gt;Every team includes some members who are more skilled than others.  It is they who should &lt;br /&gt;have greater influence in the decision making process.  It’s nice to see the junior members &lt;br /&gt;developed as professionals and given valuable experience, but bringing more people into the &lt;br /&gt;process doesn’t necessarily enhance performance in the short run. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve watched an investment organization at work where the portfolio was divided up among &lt;br /&gt;several professionals, each of whom ran his portion separately.  It seemed to me that each one &lt;br /&gt;engaged in individual stock-picking; no one was responsible for considering the portfolio’s &lt;br /&gt;overall diversification and risk; and, in fact, each person relied (without justification) on the &lt;br /&gt;others to balance out the extremeness of his actions.  The resulting portfolios represented little &lt;br /&gt;more than a bunch of concentrated bets on personal favorites thought to have home run potential. &lt;br /&gt;Systems do exist in which responsibility for portfolio management is apportioned, and they can &lt;br /&gt;work.  But they have to incorporate rigorous coordination and overall risk management.  They &lt;br /&gt;can achieve camaraderie, personnel development and results that are mostly down the middle of &lt;br /&gt;the fairway with contributions from several minds – all good things.  But I don’t believe that &lt;br /&gt;broadly sharing or dispersing portfolio management responsibility is likely to lead to highly &lt;br /&gt;superior returns. &lt;br /&gt;We get a lot of questionnaires asking, “Which portfolio manager will be assigned to our account?  &lt;br /&gt;What assurance do we have that our manager won’t deviate from your standards?”  Our answer &lt;br /&gt;is simple: all the portfolios in each Oaktree strategy are managed by a single individual or team.  &lt;br /&gt;I don’t believe in broadly dispersed portfolio management responsibility, and I don’t think you &lt;br /&gt;should, either. &lt;br /&gt;Avoid Common Mistakes &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I want to mention some of what I believe are mistakes I’ve seen made by investors and &lt;br /&gt;investment committees.  Hopefully this will help stamp out some of them. &lt;br /&gt;•Over-diversifying – It’s common for portfolios to have rules stating that they can’t invest&lt;br /&gt;more than x% per manager or per fund.  However, it’s probably only on rare occasions that&lt;br /&gt;they approach those limits.  In my opinion, most portfolios are spread too thin.  While it’s&lt;br /&gt;true that only large positions can get you into trouble, it’s equally true that only large&lt;br /&gt;positions can make a big contribution.  (This is one of the great dilemmas in investing.)&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I see 1% or ½% of portfolio capital invested with a trusted (and diversified) fund or &lt;br /&gt;manager, it strikes me as too little.  A manager who has earned his clients’ confidence should &lt;br /&gt;be entrusted with enough m&lt;br /&gt;oney to make a difference in overall portfolio results.   One &lt;br /&gt;pension plan was bold enough to let Oaktree manage 70% of its alternatives portfolio, and &lt;br /&gt;this led to a relationship that was wildly successful for both sides.  How many investors &lt;br /&gt;would have taken that chance? &lt;br /&gt;•Limiting the percentage of a manager’s AUM&lt;br /&gt; – As a counterpoint to the above, I’ve heard&lt;br /&gt;committees say, “We don’t want to represent more than x% of the manager’s assets under&lt;br /&gt;management, or of the fund’s total capital.”  But why not?  Is the goal better performance,&lt;br /&gt;or is it safety in numbers?  If you’re considering investing $10 million with a manager, why&lt;br /&gt;does it matter how much money she manages?  Why is investing $10 million safe if she&lt;br /&gt;manages $1 billion but risky if she manages $50 million?  If a manager is unusually skillful,&lt;br /&gt;aren’t you better off as her client (all else equal) if she manages less money rather than more?&lt;br /&gt;And if a manager was really good, wouldn’t you prefer that she managed only your money?&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn’t that be a great way to differentiate your performance (assuming you’re right)?  The&lt;br /&gt;pension client referred to above committed 40% of the capital for the initial fund in a new&lt;br /&gt;Oaktree strategy.  Mistake?  Not with an after-fee gain of 118% over the next three years.&lt;br /&gt;•Moderating&lt;br /&gt; – Committees often prefer to take baby steps, go slow, and invest less than the&lt;br /&gt;maximum possible.  But in the pursuit of superior investment results, moderation is not&lt;br /&gt;a virtue in and of itself.  When you look at the portfolios that do better than others over&lt;br /&gt;time, like the Yale and Harvard endowments, you usually see very substantial commitments&lt;br /&gt;to individual strategies, managers and funds.  In fact, you invariably see commitments that&lt;br /&gt;could have gotten the decision makers into trouble if they’d gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;•Managing toward peer allocations – Finally, I often see investors make reference to their&lt;br /&gt;peers’ portfolios when setting allocations.  It’s unlikely that they’re looking for the “right”&lt;br /&gt;allocation, but rather one ensuring that performance won’t be far below the pack.  But if&lt;br /&gt;you’ve mirrored the pack enough to be sure you can’t underperform, then it’s also&lt;br /&gt;likely that you won’t outperform.  Like everything else in the investing world (other than&lt;br /&gt;“alpha,” or genuine personal skill), emulating the pack cuts both ways.&lt;br /&gt;My most specific and most heartfelt advice is this:  The surest way to achieve superior &lt;br /&gt;performance is by investing significant amounts with individuals and firms that can be &lt;br /&gt;depended on for investment skill, risk control, and fair treatment of clients. &lt;br /&gt;When you’re dealing with investments where reliable probabilities can’t be assigned to the &lt;br /&gt;possible outcomes, or which entail the possibility of significant risk to the corpus (make-it-or-&lt;br /&gt;break-it-type risks), failing to diversify can be a big mistake.  But when you know of managers &lt;br /&gt;and strategies that appear to offer high returns with bearable, controlled risks, and when &lt;br /&gt;reasonable judgments can be made about the probable outcomes, it’s failing to concentrate that &lt;br /&gt;can be the big mistake. &lt;br /&gt;In short, if you can get money to work with people that your experience shows you can rely &lt;br /&gt;on, load up! &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     *&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line on striving for superior performance has a lot to do with daring to be great.  &lt;br /&gt;Especially in terms of asset allocation, “can’t lose” usually goes hand-in-hand with “can’t &lt;br /&gt;win.&lt;br /&gt;”  One of the investor’s or the committee’s first and most fundamental decisions has to be on &lt;br /&gt;the question of how far out the portfolio will venture.  How much emphasis should be put on &lt;br /&gt;diversifying, avoiding risk and ensuring against below-pack performance, and how much &lt;br /&gt;on sacrificing these things in the hope of doing better? &lt;br /&gt;I learned a lot from my favorite fortune cookie:  The cautious seldom err or write great &lt;br /&gt;poetry.  It cuts two ways, which makes it thought-provoking.  Caution can help us avoid &lt;br /&gt;mistakes, but it can also keep us from great accomplishments. &lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like caution in money managers.  I believe that in many cases, the avoidance of &lt;br /&gt;losses and terrible years is more easily achieved than repeated greatness, and thus risk control is &lt;br /&gt;more likely to create a solid foundation for a superior long-term track record.  Investing scared, &lt;br /&gt;requiring good value and a substantial margin for error, and being conscious of what you don’t &lt;br /&gt;know and can’t control are hallmarks of the best investors I know. &lt;br /&gt;But in assembling a portfolio of managers and strategies, there has to be an element of &lt;br /&gt;boldness if you hope to enjoy superior returns.  Too large a dose of caution in asset allocation &lt;br /&gt;can keep portfolios from outperforming the norm. &lt;br /&gt;Two additional factors bear on the integration of risk management in asset allocation, with its &lt;br /&gt;pivotal role in portfolio construction: &lt;br /&gt;•First, as Professor William Sharpe demonstrated, adding a risky strategy to a portfolio with&lt;br /&gt;which it is uncorrelated can reduce the overall riskiness of the portfolio.&lt;br /&gt;•Second, it should be borne in mind that when one portfolio places a greater emphasis than&lt;br /&gt;another on managers who lean toward risk control, that portfolio can allocate more of its&lt;br /&gt;capital to risky strategies without having a higher overall quantum of risk.  Thus, while&lt;br /&gt;restricting your total risk to your targeted level, would you rather allocate more money to&lt;br /&gt;the aggressive asset classes via risk-controlling managers, or less money with free-&lt;br /&gt;wheeling managers?&lt;br /&gt;*     *     *&lt;br /&gt;I hope this memo won’t come across as preachy.  The things discussed here are challenging, &lt;br /&gt;and I don’t claim to be much better at them than anyone else.  I’ve sat on the investor’s side of &lt;br /&gt;the table.  I’ve been a member of several investment committees.  I know it’s a tough job.  &lt;br /&gt;Committee and staff members have to act in what they consider to be the best interests of the &lt;br /&gt;beneficiaries, trying for superior returns but avoiding unacceptable losses.  They also have to &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;choose investment managers, separating the ones that sound good and are from the ones that &lt;br /&gt;sound good and aren’t.  (The ones that don’t sound good usually aren’t let out on the road.)  All &lt;br /&gt;we can do is our best. &lt;br /&gt;The right approach to portfolio construction has to combine discipline and hard work; skillful, &lt;br /&gt;intelligent risk bearing; and insight, flair and talent.  In that regard, I’ll cite the last three words &lt;br /&gt;of Barton Biggs’s chapter on groupthink:  “It’s not easy.” &lt;br /&gt;September 7, 2006 &lt;br /&gt;Regulations require me to point out that the performance of the investments mentioned herein &lt;br /&gt;may be more favorable than, and not representative of, other investments made by Oaktree.  If &lt;br /&gt;you would like information regarding investments other than those presented here, please &lt;br /&gt;contact your client representative.  We make no representation, and it should not be assumed, &lt;br /&gt;that past investment performance is an indication of future returns.  Moreover, wherever there is &lt;br /&gt;the potential for profit there is also the possibility of loss. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: The New Paradigm  &lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid, no one ate kiwi fruit or heirloom tomatoes – or had ever heard of them, for &lt;br /&gt;that matter.  And then, all of a sudden, they were everywhere.  The same is true for the word &lt;br /&gt;“paradigm”: no one had heard the word, and then one day it was part of everyday speech, &lt;br /&gt;especially that of management consultants and other savants.   &lt;br /&gt;“Paradigm” seems to invariably be used along with the word “new.”  No one ever talks about the &lt;br /&gt;old paradigm.  Just as there’s newness to the word, there’s usually newness to the subject it &lt;br /&gt;describes.  And there’s usually a connotation that the new paradigm represents progress. &lt;br /&gt;I believe a new paradigm has taken hold in the investment world, bringing with it vast changes – &lt;br /&gt;and not necessarily for the better.  The situation today is very different from that of just five or &lt;br /&gt;six years ago, and the implications for the future are nothing short of profound.  But I haven’t &lt;br /&gt;seen this overall subject given much attention. &lt;br /&gt;UThe Good Old Days &lt;br /&gt;In the old days – meaning prior to the current millennium – the investment world was different &lt;br /&gt;from that of today in a number of important ways: &lt;br /&gt;Risk capital was in limited supply.&lt;br /&gt;Risk aversion was reasonably present, such that in order for risky investments to be&lt;br /&gt;undertaken, that risk aversion had to be overcome by high promised returns.  The&lt;br /&gt;reluctance to make risky investments also m&lt;br /&gt;eant that they had to be supported by research&lt;br /&gt;and analysis performed by skeptical experts.&lt;br /&gt;There was a particular aversion to new, unproven and “alternative” forms of&lt;br /&gt;investment.  Fiduciary caution was an overarching consideration.  With the returns from&lt;br /&gt;U.S. equities expected to handily exceed the overall return needs of pension funds and&lt;br /&gt;endowments, alternative investments were something of an exotic luxury: tempting but also&lt;br /&gt;non-essential and somewhat forbidding.&lt;br /&gt;Because the amounts of capital pursuing alternative investments were limited, investors had&lt;br /&gt;negotiating pow&lt;br /&gt;er and were able to insist on, among other things, an incentive system that&lt;br /&gt;aligned their interests with those of their money mangers, in which fixed fees merely covered&lt;br /&gt;managers’ expenses and incentive fees offered managers the hoped-for brass ring.&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UThe Great New Days &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my view, all of the elements listed above have changed drastically in the last few years.  &lt;br /&gt;(You’ve seen some of this from me before, but not all in one place.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The stock market’s losses in 2000-02 substantially cooled investors’ ardor for equities.  &lt;br /&gt;Instead of 9-11%, U.S. stocks now are universally expected to return just 5-7%.  Thus &lt;br /&gt;pension funds and endowments that need 8% or more are looking elsewhere for return.  &lt;br /&gt;That “elsewhere” means non-traditional market niches such as buyouts, venture capital, &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds, real estate and emerging market equities and debt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This stretch for return has overcome innate caution.  Any aversion to the risks entailed in &lt;br /&gt;these markets has been wiped away by the combination of (1) the perceived paucity of return &lt;br /&gt;in traditional stocks and bonds, (2) the high returns achieved recently in the alternate &lt;br /&gt;markets, and (3) the failure of risk to turn into loss in the last few years.  Recent successes &lt;br /&gt;have erased from the collective consciousness any reluctance to undertake the new, unproven &lt;br /&gt;or risky.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a result, large amounts of money are demanding access to the alternative markets.  &lt;br /&gt;However, these markets are much smaller than the traditional stock and bond markets that &lt;br /&gt;now seem uninteresting.   (The Financial Times reported on September 11 that according to &lt;br /&gt;JPMorgan, the alternative investment world amounts to $3 trillion, while the size of the &lt;br /&gt;mainstream bond and equity world is estimated at $60 trillion.)  Thus the amounts people are &lt;br /&gt;trying to invest can overwhelm these markets.  For this reason, investors may attach more &lt;br /&gt;importance to the ability to put large sums to work than to being able to attain historic &lt;br /&gt;returns and risk premiums, clear high due diligence hurdles, or structure fee &lt;br /&gt;arrangements that channel managers’ energies for the benefit of clients. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For now, the high level of liquidity is creating a “virtuous cycle.”  The inflows have (1) &lt;br /&gt;given rise to asset appreciation, high returns and further demand, and (2) made it easy for &lt;br /&gt;weak companies to finance their way out of trouble, thus contributing to the impression that &lt;br /&gt;the level of risk is low. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The business model for managers in these areas has been completely altered by these &lt;br /&gt;developments.  Because the amounts under management are so large (and the ability to &lt;br /&gt;charge high management fees is so great), managers can get rich off management fees and &lt;br /&gt;deal fees alone.  For managers, then, high returns may be a nice-to-have, not a need-to-&lt;br /&gt;have, and avoiding endangering the fee machine can become a greater preoccupation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is my view that, in combination, these developments have had a number of undesirable effects &lt;br /&gt;on the investment environment such that: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Willingness to bear risk is up. &lt;br /&gt; Insistence on high risk premiums is down. &lt;br /&gt; Skepticism is down, and there’s widespread willingness to suspend disbelief. &lt;br /&gt; Demand for t-crossing and i-dotting is in retreat. &lt;br /&gt; Quantity can replace quality as the sine qua non for portfolio construction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll provide a few examples below to illustrate what I think is going on in the alternative markets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UBuyouts: Where’s the Magic? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A startling revolution has taken place among buyout funds in the last year or so.  Let’s take a &lt;br /&gt;look at how we got here. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So many of the big-name, highly leveraged buyouts of the late 1980s went bankrupt in 1990 – &lt;br /&gt;Macy’s, Federated, National Gypsum, etc., etc. – that the industry had to recreate itself, dropping &lt;br /&gt;the discredited word “leveraged” and the previously ubiquitous acronym LBO.  Instead, the &lt;br /&gt;industry began to call what it does “buyouts” or “private equity.”  It switched its model from &lt;br /&gt;loading massive leverage on venerable, multi-billion dollar companies to the mantras of &lt;br /&gt;“platform and buildup” and “consolidate the industry.”   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the 1990s, the low levels of leverage permitted by chastened lenders kept the buyout boys &lt;br /&gt;from closing any landmark acquisitions, but also from loading on enough debt to render their &lt;br /&gt;companies vulnerable to distress.  In order to lose huge amounts of capital, buyout funds had to &lt;br /&gt;venture into the tech and telecom arenas, and relatively few rose to the occasion.  Thus buyout &lt;br /&gt;funds got through the 2002 debt debacle largely unscathed.  The buyouts of the 1990s did not &lt;br /&gt;give rise to a high level of bankruptcies, but neither were the returns spectacular, even with &lt;br /&gt;leveraged equity in a rising stock market. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pioneers of the buyout business – like KKR, Warburg Pincus and Apax Partners – enjoyed &lt;br /&gt;the spectacular success that can come with early entry and good execution.  But as a result of the &lt;br /&gt;trends since the mid-1980s, results for most buyout funds have been anything but spectacular.  &lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in “Dare to be Great,” from 1980 to 1997 the typical fund performed just in line &lt;br /&gt;with the unleveraged S&amp;P 500.  So what’s happened since then? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The stock market declined for three consecutive years for the first time since the 1930s. &lt;br /&gt; Buyout funds did okay. &lt;br /&gt; Expectations for returns from stocks have been almost halved. &lt;br /&gt; Financial engineering (in an extremely benign capital market) has enabled buyout funds &lt;br /&gt;formed in the last few years to report sky-high internal rates of return on their early winners. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a result of the above, the demand for funds in the buyout field – and especially “big buyout” – &lt;br /&gt;is absolutely booming.  I believe that in 2000, KKR couldn’t get $10 billion for its Millennium &lt;br /&gt;Fund and closed at $6+ billion instead.  Their current fund is at $15 billion, and that on top of $5 &lt;br /&gt;billion they raised through a public offering in Amsterdam earlier this year.  Several funds have &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been raised with capital in eleven figures, and $15 billion has become the new $5 billion.  $6 &lt;br /&gt;billion is considered a mid-sized fund, and $2-3 billion feels like small-fry.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s behind the boom?  As elsewhere in the investment business, the buyout managers talk a &lt;br /&gt;great game, and the best have produced excellent results over the years – although perhaps not &lt;br /&gt;always as good as they intimate.  In 1999, I explained distressed debt investing to a state pension &lt;br /&gt;fund and said I thought we could m&lt;br /&gt;ake 20% before fees.  “Buyout fund x was just in here,” they &lt;br /&gt;said, “and they think they can make 30%.”  I’m confident that most 1999 vintage buyout funds &lt;br /&gt;didn’t make 30%.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the last couple of years, cheap money made available by avid lenders – willing even to &lt;br /&gt;lend money that would be paid out immediately to stockholders, increasing indebtedness but not &lt;br /&gt;adding to assets, revenues or profits – has enabled buyout funds to shrink their equity &lt;br /&gt;investments and supercharge their IRRs.  Not always larger dollar profits or higher ratios of &lt;br /&gt;terminal value to committed capital, but higher reported rates of return – probably in many cases &lt;br /&gt;on small amounts of equity for brief periods of time (See “You Can’t Eat IRR”).  But people are &lt;br /&gt;turned on by high percentage returns, and the dollars have followed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believe the largest pools of investment capital have given up on getting the returns they need &lt;br /&gt;from now-debased equities and have turned to buyouts and the like for help.  I imagine a thought &lt;br /&gt;process that goes like this:  “Historically, good buyout funds have had returns in the high teens &lt;br /&gt;net of fees.  Even though the environment isn’t what it used to be, it should be a lay-up for them &lt;br /&gt;to reach the low teens.  I’d even be happy with 10%; it would certainly help me with my 8% &lt;br /&gt;required return.  And I can put a billion to work in one phone call.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I’m not sure many buyout firms have produced historic average returns in the high teens.  &lt;br /&gt;(According to Bloomberg, “U.S. buyout funds produced returns of 13.3% during the past two &lt;br /&gt;decades.”)  And even if the best did, that doesn’t mean earning even low teens will be easy in the &lt;br /&gt;environment ahead.  Finally, I’m not convinced that returns in the low teens are enough to make &lt;br /&gt;it worth bearing the risk that comes with leverage, illiquidity and competition for deals.  But the &lt;br /&gt;money flowing into buyout funds makes it clear that I’m in the minority.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Outlook for Buyout Returns &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investors – in any field – can make money in four broad ways: buy cheap, add value, apply &lt;br /&gt;financial engineering and sell dear.  Let’s examine each one as it applies to buyouts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UBuying cheapU – The golden age of buyouts lasted from approximately the mid-1970s to the mid-&lt;br /&gt;1980s.  What was the environment like as that period began? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The stock market was in a terrible slump, with Business Week heralding “The Death of &lt;br /&gt;Equities.” &lt;br /&gt; Companies could be bought cheaper through the stock market than they could be built for. &lt;br /&gt; Historically, before the age of leverage, one company could buy another only if the would-be &lt;br /&gt;acquirer was larger than the target.  Thus the competition to acquire was limited. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As the LBO era dawned, only a few organizations had the inclination and know-how &lt;br /&gt;required to buy companies bigger than themselves.  &lt;br /&gt; Buyout funds were tiny, and their modus operandi consisted of paying bargain prices for &lt;br /&gt;small, little-known companies or orphaned divisions of larger companies with stable cash &lt;br /&gt;flows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today’s environment bears little resemblance to that one. As I mentioned in a memo earlier this &lt;br /&gt;year, I’d heard a buyout mogul say, “It’s our job to buy good companies at fair prices and make &lt;br /&gt;them better.”  I doubt he was content with fair-priced purchases thirty years ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Listed companies are cheaper today than they were in 1999, but not nearly as cheap as in &lt;br /&gt;1976.  The P/E ratio on the S&amp;P 500 is 17.5 today versus 10.3 at the inception of the LBO &lt;br /&gt;movement three decades ago. &lt;br /&gt; To deploy unspent capital that in August was estimated by The Financial Times at $297 &lt;br /&gt;billion, buyout funds will have to acquire companies worth roughly $1.5 trillion in the years &lt;br /&gt;ahead.  That’s a few percent of all of the world’s stock markets.  &lt;br /&gt; The buyout funds are competing with each other to spend their capital, and they also have to &lt;br /&gt;compete against strategic corporate buyers that have enjoyed strong profitability and are &lt;br /&gt;cash-rich.  (Nevertheless, buyout funds often outbid strategic buyers, who in theory should be &lt;br /&gt;able to pay more because they can combine the acquiree’s operations with their own and &lt;br /&gt;garner efficiencies.)   &lt;br /&gt; In some cases, activist shareholders and cash-swollen hedge funds are pushing managements &lt;br /&gt;(and boards under increased scrutiny) to demand higher prices before turning over their &lt;br /&gt;companies to buyout funds, and escalating purchase prices are frequently the result.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Under this combination of circumstances, are there still bargains to be found?  Here’s the big &lt;br /&gt;question that’s nagging at me:  Everyone is convinced that investing in listed U.S. equities at &lt;br /&gt;today’s prices will produce gross returns of 5-7% in the years ahead.  If that’s true, then &lt;br /&gt;how can buyout funds go into that same market, pay substantial control premiums over &lt;br /&gt;their target companies’ stock prices, and generate double-digit annual returns after &lt;br /&gt;deducting 2-4% per year in management fees, deal fees and incentive fees?  Will there be &lt;br /&gt;enough “value added” and financial engineering to bridge that gap?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UAdding valueU – The buyout funds claim that they’ll be able to create gains by making companies &lt;br /&gt;better.  But many companies have been working hard for years to improve their efficiency and &lt;br /&gt;profitability.  There’s always room for improvement, but it’s a lot harder to make money this &lt;br /&gt;way than by buying something cheap and selling it at a fair price.  As in everything else, the &lt;br /&gt;best managers will add substantial value, but if it was easy enough for everyone to do it, it &lt;br /&gt;probably would have been done already.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UFinancial engineeringU – Between the two, I’d rather bet on fundamental improvement than &lt;br /&gt;smoke and mirrors.  Withdrawing equity in order to leverage up the IRR doesn’t add any value.  &lt;br /&gt;It couldn’t be done in the stingier debt market of five years ago, and it may not be doable five &lt;br /&gt;years from now if a business slowdown shows lenders its folly.  Rising interest rates would be a &lt;br /&gt;negative, and factoring in a more restrictive capital market would ring the bell on radical &lt;br /&gt;financial engineering for a while. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USelling dearU – Of course, you can always hope to sell at valuation multiples higher than you &lt;br /&gt;paid, but it’s not reasonable to count on being able to do so all the time.  Purchase multiples &lt;br /&gt;below the historic norms could buttress such an expectation, but we’re not there now.  Today’s &lt;br /&gt;valuation multiples are being supported by low interest rates (prices of financial instrumen&lt;br /&gt;as demanded yields decline, and vice versa), and higher interest rates would be expected to &lt;br /&gt;reduce sale prices for companies.  And as the subject companies get bigger and bigger, the &lt;br /&gt;number of possible buyers shrinks.  For the $30 billion companies that are being talked about &lt;br /&gt;today, the stock market may be the only exit, and that’s something that can’t be counted on ye&lt;br /&gt;in and yea&lt;br /&gt;ts rise &lt;br /&gt;ar-&lt;br /&gt;r-out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So in contrast to the description of the golden days of buyouts on the previous page, today we &lt;br /&gt;have: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A buyout phenomenon that everyone’s aware of and eager to play. &lt;br /&gt; A stock market that can’t be described as cheap. &lt;br /&gt; Heavy competition to buy target companies. &lt;br /&gt; Dependence on financial engineering based on low interest rates and generous capital &lt;br /&gt;markets that may not stay that way forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We also see companies being sold from one buyout fund to another.  What does that imply?  In &lt;br /&gt;most transactions, one party’s right and the other’s wrong.   Generally, the buyer can’t be getting &lt;br /&gt;a bargain unless the seller is accepting less than he should.  And shouldn’t the seller know the &lt;br /&gt;company best (and be expected to have made the available improvements)?  So are the selling &lt;br /&gt;buyout funds being generous?  Are buyers overpaying?  Or are the transactions motivated by a &lt;br /&gt;desire to lock in incentive fees and generate further deal fees?  If there is a free lunch, where’s it &lt;br /&gt;coming from?  I’ll leave those questions to you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buyout prices have been rising as a multiple of company earnings, and companies are being &lt;br /&gt;bought with greater proportions of debt in an attempt to squeeze out higher returns on the buyout &lt;br /&gt;firms’ equity.  As companies become more highly geared, the outcomes become more dependent &lt;br /&gt;on a favorable environment.  As they say in Las Vegas, “The more you bet, the more you win &lt;br /&gt;when you win.”  But, simply put, when you increase leverage, the probability of getting into &lt;br /&gt;a jam increases and the consequences of that jam worsen.  Certainly this is not a cautious, &lt;br /&gt;capital-starved environment for buyouts in which people have girded for tough times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have to admit it: if I could push the fast-forward button and see how a movie ends, it would be &lt;br /&gt;this one.  Like most “silver bullets,” I think buyouts will fail to live up to the highest &lt;br /&gt;expectations of those who’re making it the darling of the investment world today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find the outlook for funds in the “big buyout” category particularly intriguing.  Certainly the &lt;br /&gt;managers spin a convincing tale:  Because there are so few buyers capable of tackling the biggest &lt;br /&gt;transactions, the competition to buy will be limited and transaction prices will be kept low.  The &lt;br /&gt;few big funds will tend to join forces in “club deals,” further precluding bidding wars.  And, &lt;br /&gt;based on the supposed correlation between corporate bigness and inefficiency, it’s claimed that &lt;br /&gt;vast gains will be wrought from streamlining the acquired companies.  We’ll see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UHow About Real Estate? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other day, I was privileged to hike with a friend who I consider one of the very best value-&lt;br /&gt;added real estate investors, Dean Adler of Lubert-Adler.  I thought I was listening to a tape of my &lt;br /&gt;worrisome self.  Dean told a tale that I found scary – even though I don’t stand to lose a penny if &lt;br /&gt;his warnings hold true.  Here’s what he says is going on in the real estate arena: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As in other parts of the world of investment and finance, the ability to borrow is what’s keeping &lt;br /&gt;the wheels turning.  And the ability to borrow for real estate investments is under the control of a &lt;br /&gt;group of people called appraisers.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean’s firm spends months performing in-depth analysis on the properties it owns and wants to &lt;br /&gt;finance, and on those it wishes to buy.  Then it takes the data to lenders . . . who don’t care.  All &lt;br /&gt;that matters, they say, is what the appraiser thinks.  If the appraiser says your property is worth &lt;br /&gt;100, you can borrow 80.  But if he says it’s worth 50, you can only borrow 40. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the data generated by Lubert-Adler through months of analysis is dismissed by the &lt;br /&gt;lender, but the opinion of the appraiser – who spends perhaps a week or two looking at the &lt;br /&gt;property – is accepted unquestioningly.  But – I have to say it – if the appraiser was as good as &lt;br /&gt;Dean at putting values on property, wouldn’t he be a leading real estate investor rather than an &lt;br /&gt;appraiser? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The real estate story has other negative aspects.  The first is that whereas I posit being able to &lt;br /&gt;borrow 80% of appraised value, it has become possible to borrow more than 100%, as lenders &lt;br /&gt;will finance not just the purchase price, but development and other expenses as well.  In “Field &lt;br /&gt;of Dreams,” they said “If you build it, they will come.”  In real estate, it’s more like, “If you’ll &lt;br /&gt;lend them money, they will buy or build.”  Just imagine what goes through the heads of real &lt;br /&gt;estate dreamers when the capital markets allow them to take risks with other people’s money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Dean pointed to construction loans.  These short-term (and, in today’s market, low-rate) &lt;br /&gt;loans bear the substantial risks associated with delays, cost overruns and the like.  And yet they &lt;br /&gt;are being made by hedge funds that lack real estate expertise, experience and infrastructure.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If having a sense for the behavior going on around us can be highly instructive, as I feel it &lt;br /&gt;can, then these observations from the real estate industry should be cautionary.  As I often &lt;br /&gt;quote Warren Buffett as saying, “The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the &lt;br /&gt;greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.”  Dean Adler’s description &lt;br /&gt;of the state of affairs in real estate doesn’t suggest there’s a lot of prudence out there, &lt;br /&gt;meaning it’s time for us to apply our own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UGive Me Structure &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, we would raise $100 from a client and use it to buy $100 worth of high yield &lt;br /&gt;bonds.  We still do it that way, but in many quarters, that $100 is used as the equity for a &lt;br /&gt;structured investment vehicle, such as a CDO, CBO or CLO, in which it supports the purchase of &lt;br /&gt;$1,000 worth of (management fee-generating) bonds. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateralized Debt Obligations, Bond Obligations and Loan Obligations are entities that collect &lt;br /&gt;capital from investors and lenders with which to construct portfolios of the relevant instruments.  &lt;br /&gt;The capital structure of the entity is tiered, so that the providers of capital have varying priorities &lt;br /&gt;in terms of being repaid and participating in loss&lt;br /&gt;es.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The senior-most lender enjoys security from the entire portfolio, and because his loan is thus &lt;br /&gt;heavily over-secured and highly rated, he demands only a low rate of return.  The second-most-&lt;br /&gt;senior loan is a bit less well secured and less highly rated, and thus the rate demanded on his debt &lt;br /&gt;is a bit higher, and so forth.  Because the interest rates promised to the senior lenders are below &lt;br /&gt;the average coupon on the portfolio, there should be a lot of cash left over for the junior lenders &lt;br /&gt;and the equity investors – if things go well.  But the equity is also in the first-loss position, so it’s &lt;br /&gt;truly a make-it-or-break-it proposition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vast sums have been raised for this “silver-bullet” solution to the problems of allocating risk, &lt;br /&gt;leveraging returns and putting money to work.  Clearly, the key to seeing all this work out lies in &lt;br /&gt;enough credit expertise being present for risks to be controlled and defaults minimized.  But &lt;br /&gt;today the necessary ingredient for the establishment of these structured vehicles isn’t credit &lt;br /&gt;expertise, but the ability to structure the entity so as to win high-enough ratings on the senior &lt;br /&gt;tranches to attract capital and permit a lot of leverage.  This distinction is highly significant.  In a &lt;br /&gt;clear analogue to real estate appraisers, the people controlling the all-important credit spigot are &lt;br /&gt;the financial structurers assembling the entities and the CDO analysts at the credit rating &lt;br /&gt;agencies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a June 2 article entitled “Structured Complacency,” the often-brilliant “Grant’s Interest Rate &lt;br /&gt;Observer” went into great (and, as usual, critical) detail on this phenomenon.  As to the &lt;br /&gt;popularity of structured vehicles, it wrote, “Credit markets are sanguine.  Structured credit is &lt;br /&gt;proliferating.  Could the first fact be related to the second?”  And as a key part of this trend, &lt;br /&gt;it says, “Financial engineering is displacing credit analysis.”  What’s the difference?  &lt;br /&gt;“Financial engineering is the science of structuring cash flows; credit analysis is the art of &lt;br /&gt;getting paid.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why the declining interest in credit analysis?  Grant’s advances the thesis that it is linked to &lt;br /&gt;disintermediation, in which many lenders no longer hold on to the loans they make, but more &lt;br /&gt;often syndicate or sell them onward to other providers of capital.  Holding the keys in this &lt;br /&gt;process are the risk manager who structures the entity based on statistical likelihoods and the &lt;br /&gt;rating agency that applies the stamp of approval for buyers lacking direct knowledge of the &lt;br /&gt;underlying instruments and the ability to understand the structure.  Grant’s quotes the IMF’s &lt;br /&gt;2006 Global Financial Stability Report: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, the development of structured credit markets has coincided with &lt;br /&gt;the increasing involvement of people with advanced financial engineering skills &lt;br /&gt;required to measure and manage these often complex risks.  In fact, for many &lt;br /&gt;market participants, the application of such skills may have become more &lt;br /&gt;important than fundamental credit analysis. . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions with market participants raised questions as to whether the increased &lt;br /&gt;focus on structuring skills, relative to “credit” analysis, may itself present a &lt;br /&gt;concern. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The structurers are “risk managers.”  They assemble mathematic&lt;br /&gt;al models that extrapolate &lt;br /&gt;historic default rates and recovery rates (which may or may not have relevance in today’s &lt;br /&gt;environment).  They look at probabilities, expected values and correlations.  But they count &lt;br /&gt;heavily on the statistical properties of the universe as it has been and may know rather little &lt;br /&gt;about the actual assets contained in the portfolios.  Of course, this sort of reliance on &lt;br /&gt;statistically derived expectations was behind the undoing of Long Term Capital &lt;br /&gt;Management in 1998 – of which so little seems to be remembered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grant’s describes an interview with a junior analyst at a rating agency whose job it is to monitor &lt;br /&gt;the health of a large number of CDOs each day, plugging numbers into an Excel spreadsheet.  &lt;br /&gt;According to Grant’s, “he doubts that many people really understand what these structures own, &lt;br /&gt;how their assets are correlated, or what might happen to them in the liquidation portion of a &lt;br /&gt;credit cycle.”  To wrap up, Grant’s quotes Michael Lewitt of Harch Capital Manager, a manager &lt;br /&gt;of bank loans: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . having a credit market priced on a non-credit basis – meaning priced off &lt;br /&gt;quantitative and arbitrage bases, and not on credit fundamentals – is not a healthy &lt;br /&gt;thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Interestingly in this connection, Wachovia Structured Products reports that as of April, of the 47 &lt;br /&gt;Collateralized Loan Obligations that had gone full cycle, 30 generated positive returns for their &lt;br /&gt;equity.  Put the other way around 17, or 36%, had lost money.  I doubt that was the expectation &lt;br /&gt;on which they were sold.  And that in relatively good times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My favorite investment adage warns about the things “the fool does in the end.”  Clearly, &lt;br /&gt;turning over the administration of credit to appraisers, raters and structurers who know &lt;br /&gt;relatively little about the underlying assets they’re dealing with – and who are hired hands &lt;br /&gt;without their own capital at risk – signals a dangerous late stage of the inevitable cycle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UIt’s Time to Hedge &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Given the laxness, euphoria and credulousness that I detect in the market for money today, &lt;br /&gt;it’s time for caution.  Where better to find it than in funds that hedge? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, of course, today the term “hedge fund” has nothing to do with hedging and &lt;br /&gt;everything to do with incentive fees.  In no way does that label connote risk control.  And &lt;br /&gt;whereas the shortcomings of the structured entities described above go along with the activities &lt;br /&gt;fitting their charter, most hedge funds have unlimited charters and can roam free in search of &lt;br /&gt;return.  Here are a few recent trends: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hedge funds are making “second lien loans” in large numbers.  In some cases, however, &lt;br /&gt;there are no assets left (after the claims of first lien loans) to have a lien against.  They may &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or may not be made by people who have previously been lenders.  Those people may or may &lt;br /&gt;not possess workout experience.  And it’s an open question how hedge funds holding large &lt;br /&gt;portfolios of small loans will behave when companies get into financial hot water.  Lately &lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard mention that hedge funds might&lt;br /&gt; be making these loans to gain control of &lt;br /&gt;companies that default.  But it isn’t clear to me how appreciation will routinely be wrung &lt;br /&gt;from loans that are made at par and subsequently become non-performing. &lt;br /&gt;Since I moved to Los Angeles in 1980, my friends in “The Industry” have been unanimous in&lt;br /&gt;one piece of advice: never invest in movies.  Yet The Wall Street Journal of April 29 carried&lt;br /&gt;a story headlined, “Defying the Odds, Hedge Funds Bet Billions on Movies.”&lt;br /&gt;For decades, movie studios have gladly accepted millions of dollars from a group &lt;br /&gt;of investors collectively dismissed as “dumb money”: deep-pocketed dentists, oil &lt;br /&gt;tycoons and other wealthy individuals eager for a piece of the glamorous but &lt;br /&gt;high-risk game of film production.  But the biggest influx of money in Hollywood &lt;br /&gt;these days is coming from sharks, not suckers: hedge funds, private equity funds &lt;br /&gt;and investment banks. &lt;br /&gt;Take the example of “Posei&lt;br /&gt;don,” which was co-financed by hedge fund-backed Virtual&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Studios.  It &lt;br /&gt;has brought in gross revenues of $180 million worldwide since May against its &lt;br /&gt;production budget of $160 million, meaning that after the deduction of at least half the &lt;br /&gt;revenues for distribution charges, advertising costs and exhibitors’ fees, it’s still a big loser. &lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve never claimed to understand, it’s how you put a price on a highly&lt;br /&gt;improbable disaster.  Thus I have a lot of respect for anyone who can do a consistently&lt;br /&gt;superior job of underwriting catastrophe insurance against earthquakes, hurricanes and&lt;br /&gt;terrorist events.  Is the right premium for insuring a Caribbean &lt;br /&gt;hotel against hurricanes $1&lt;br /&gt;million or $5 million, given that the loss may be zero or $100 million?  The difficulty of&lt;br /&gt;setting these premiums isn’t keeping&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds from filling the gap in the “cat insurance”&lt;br /&gt;market.&lt;br /&gt;Along similar lines as catastrophe insurance, hedge funds are among the leading writers of&lt;br /&gt;Credit Default Swaps, the equivalent of issuing insurance against bond defaults.  Hedge&lt;br /&gt;funds find it attractive to write this coverage for multi-year periods, perhaps in part because&lt;br /&gt;the premiums are taken into earnings each year, adding to returns and giving rise to incentive&lt;br /&gt;fees, while the defaults are likely to come later.  As in any form of risk transfer, the&lt;br /&gt;ultimate profitability of this proposition will depend on how well the insurers know the&lt;br /&gt;risks and on what they’re able &lt;br /&gt;to charge in terms of premiums.  When lots of hedge&lt;br /&gt;funds are eager to sell CDS, however, premiums are driven down, and they can easily prove&lt;br /&gt;inadequate when defaults occur down the road.&lt;br /&gt;In recent months we’ve seen hedge funds take major losses (sometimes prompting them to&lt;br /&gt;close their doors) in natural gas trading and unhedged emerging market equities.  I’ve read of&lt;br /&gt;hedge funds that trade in carbon dioxide emissions and one backing a fledgling fashion&lt;br /&gt;designer.  And hedge funds are making the construction loans that Dean Adler discussed.&lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these activities is imprudent in and of itself.  But they all involve substantial risk &lt;br /&gt;and should be undertaken only by people possessing the essential edge: sufficient expertise &lt;br /&gt;in the relevant field to be able to know  when the opportunities are truly attractive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhy This Appetite for Risk? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my memo on hedge funds of two years ago, I cited an insightful piece from Byron Wien of &lt;br /&gt;Morgan Stanley called “In Praise of Hedge Fund Volatility.”  In it, he observed that many hedge &lt;br /&gt;funds have become asset gatherers for whom the retention of assets and the receipt of &lt;br /&gt;management fees have become more important than the achievement of high returns and the &lt;br /&gt;earning of incentive fees.  Thus low volatility has supplanted high return in the pantheon of &lt;br /&gt;virtues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my view, this trend has reached beyond hedge funds to additional corners of the alternative &lt;br /&gt;investing world.  The concept of management fees sufficient to “pay the light bill” seems &lt;br /&gt;obsolete.  For example, even at just 1¼% per annum, a $15 billion buyout fund can generate &lt;br /&gt;more than $1 billion of management fees over its lifetime.  Add to that the “deal fees” and &lt;br /&gt;“monitoring fees” commonly charged and it’s easy to picture managers becoming wealthy &lt;br /&gt;irrespective of performance.  Indeed, the ancillary fees can be so massive that even where some &lt;br /&gt;or all of them must be applied to offset management fees, managers can receive total fees that far &lt;br /&gt;exceed the stated management fee percentage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, if a fund can generate $1 billion or more in fees, you as its manager would love to &lt;br /&gt;perpetuate that flow.  While you don’t need high returns in order to get rich, it would be nice to &lt;br /&gt;be able to repeat this process, so returns should be good enough to permit further funds to be &lt;br /&gt;raised.  But the notion of managers who are entirely dependent on high returns for the &lt;br /&gt;achievement of their financial dreams may to some extent have become a thing of the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what’s the new paradigm?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; First, raise a lot of money.   &lt;br /&gt; Second, try for a rate of return that clients will find acceptable.   &lt;br /&gt; Third, don’t take enough risk to possibly preclude an encore.   &lt;br /&gt; Fourth, invest as fast as is prudently possible, so that another fund can be raised while &lt;br /&gt;the market remains accommodating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I believe this last point may be part of the reason for managers’ ever-growing willingness to &lt;br /&gt;invest in large transactions and afield from the tried-and-true.  In view of today’s incentive &lt;br /&gt;structure for managers, speed and size can count for more than investment excellence.  Some &lt;br /&gt;managers will sell out knowingly, even proactively.  Others may be influenced more insidiously.  &lt;br /&gt;And some will be egged on by clients emphasizing their desire to invest large amounts of money &lt;br /&gt;with low volatility and downplaying the need for high returns.  Managers who do not want to be &lt;br /&gt;so affected (and their clients) must strongly resist this trend.  Recognizing it is the first step in &lt;br /&gt;doing so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t give me pleasure to talk about an environment in which risk aversion is in short &lt;br /&gt;supply, risk premiums are skimpy and danger lurks.  Or in which there’s a new paradigm capable &lt;br /&gt;of contributing to a misalignment of interests between investors and their m&lt;br /&gt;anagers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it is what it is.  Take a look at the lists of elements on pages 2, 3 (top), 6 and 11 and tell me &lt;br /&gt;which ones you think aren’t described accurately.  If you agree that the investment world of &lt;br /&gt;today is captured in those lists, then the prescription is unambiguous: it’s time for caution &lt;br /&gt;and risk control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The workings of free capital markets require that in order to overcome investors’ innate &lt;br /&gt;aversion to risk, seemingly riskier investments must offer the possibility of higher returns &lt;br /&gt;providing “risk premiums.”  But when risk aversion is at cyclical lows, risk premiums &lt;br /&gt;needn’t be generous; people will invest anyway.  Too many people trying to dine at the buffet &lt;br /&gt;simultaneously can lead to a disorderly process and skimpy portions.  I recommend that you look &lt;br /&gt;twice at the cost of admission and – if you do decide to partake – proceed carefully.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the last few years, my mantra has been “special niches, special people.”  By the “special &lt;br /&gt;people” part I mean it’s important to find managers who possess the skills required to safely &lt;br /&gt;pursue return in high-priced markets.  It’s at least as important in the current environment, &lt;br /&gt;however, that they also can be counted on to resist the conditions described above in the interest &lt;br /&gt;of serving their clients. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;October 19, 2006 &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Re:    Pigweed  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At Citibank back in the ’70s, Chief Investment Officer Peter Vermilye placed a lot of emphasis &lt;br /&gt;on building team spirit.  His tools included skits at our annual staff outings, and he never &lt;br /&gt;hesitated to participate in costume.  My favorite was his portrayal of Johnny Carson’s savant, &lt;br /&gt;“Carnac the Magnificent.”  He would hold a sealed envelope to his forehead and intone &lt;br /&gt;“Schlum-bair-zhjay,” as the French pronounce the oil service company’s name.  Upon opening &lt;br /&gt;the envelope, he would read, “What they call it at $75.”  Holding up the next envelope, he’d say &lt;br /&gt;“Slum-burger.”  The explanation inside: “What they call it at $15.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, investors love things as long as they’re riding high but lose all respect when &lt;br /&gt;they’re brought low.  It doesn’t take long to become discredited in the investment world.  And so &lt;br /&gt;it is for Amaranth Advisors, which now might be relabeled “pigweed” – another word for the &lt;br /&gt;plant that gave the fund its name.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those who’ve been incommunicado over the last few months, Amaranth is a hedge fund that &lt;br /&gt;was formed in 2000.  In the beginning it stressed relatively safe strategies like convertible &lt;br /&gt;arbitrage.  But more recently it ventured into other things and in 2004 hired a young man named &lt;br /&gt;Brian Hunter to engage in energy trading, leading to the recent events.  On September 18, it &lt;br /&gt;announced that it had lost 40% of its $9.5 billion of total capital on natural gas trading, a &lt;br /&gt;percentage that was revised upward to 65% over the next few days.  The fund sold off its energy &lt;br /&gt;trading book, Brian Hunter departed, and Amaranth threw in the towel and is liquidating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that Amaranth’s collapse has earned it a place on the list of investment disasters, we should &lt;br /&gt;consider the lessons that can be learned from it.  I’ll try to provide some useful insights regarding &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth, as usual without claiming to be an expert on the subject. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UYou Bet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I read about Amaranth, one thing stood out: the repeated use of the words “trade” and, &lt;br /&gt;especially, “bet.”  Nothing about “invest” or “own.”  And certainly no reference to “value.”  The &lt;br /&gt;pattern really is striking.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, part of this change in attitude could be attributable to the defrocking described above.  &lt;br /&gt;Six months ago, the articles might have described Amaranth as an astute energy investor, rather &lt;br /&gt;than the reckless gambler it’s considered today.  But certainly the new nomenclature is &lt;br /&gt;everywhere, and I find it appropriate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s the distinction?  Investors want to own things for the long run, under the belief they’ll &lt;br /&gt;grow and strengthen over time (or that today’s values will come to be better appreciated).  &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders buy and sell, usually in short order, to take advantage of momentary phenomena.  I &lt;br /&gt;usually think of them as&lt;br /&gt; betti ng on the direction of the next price move.  Certainly we can say &lt;br /&gt;their timeframe is hours or days, or maybe weeks, but rarely months and never years. &lt;br /&gt;And what is a “bet”?  That’s one of those words we all know the meaning of but would be hard-&lt;br /&gt;pressed to define without using the synonym “wager” or the word “bet” itself.  I consulted The &lt;br /&gt;Random House Dictionary of the English Language and found a very useful definition: a bet is &lt;br /&gt;“a pledge of a forfeit risked on some&lt;br /&gt; uncertain outcome.”  In other words, you attempt to profit &lt;br /&gt;from an uncertain event, and if it doesn’t go as you hope, you forfeit something of value.  Well &lt;br /&gt;then, Amaranth certainly was a bettor. &lt;br /&gt;One question:  If it’s so obvious today that Amaranth was “betting,” were people equally aware &lt;br /&gt;of that fact a few months ago?  I don’t think so.  Gains are often presum&lt;br /&gt;ed to be the result of &lt;br /&gt;carefully considered investments, while it’s usually losing ventures that are described as &lt;br /&gt;having been bets. &lt;br /&gt;UWhat Was Their Game? &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth’s energy trading operation was in business to bet (there I go!) on short-term &lt;br /&gt;movements in energy prices.  But it didn’t base its activities on saying “we want to own natural &lt;br /&gt;gas” or “we want to be short.”  That would be risky. &lt;br /&gt;Instead, it said things like this: “The price of natural gas is always higher in the winter than in the &lt;br /&gt;summer, as is proper, because cold weather causes the demand for gas to increase.  But right &lt;br /&gt;now, we think the price discrepancy is wider than it should be: January gas is too high relative to &lt;br /&gt;July gas.  So we’ll short January gas and buy an equal amount of July gas.”  Under this approach, &lt;br /&gt;there’s no net exposure to the overall direction of gas prices, just a bet (if you will) on the &lt;br /&gt;wideness of the spread.  The fund won’t gain if the price of gas rises or lose if it falls.  Instead, &lt;br /&gt;it’ll gain if the spread narrows in a reversion to the mean, or it’ll lose if the spread anomalously &lt;br /&gt;widens further. &lt;br /&gt;This is a true hedged position: an arbitrage.  I define arbitrage as taking largely offsetting &lt;br /&gt;positions in the same or closely related assets exhibiting a price discrepancy, with the goal &lt;br /&gt;of profiting, with very little risk, when the mispricing corrects.  Its aim is to profit from the &lt;br /&gt;movement of asset prices relative to each other (the relationship between which usually can be &lt;br /&gt;counted on to stay within a normal range), not from the movement of the price of a single asset &lt;br /&gt;(which can behave any way at all in the short run).  This is a very valid approach for a hedge &lt;br /&gt;fund to take.  It epitomizes hedging, something that most hedge funds now seem to engage in &lt;br /&gt;infrequently or not at all. &lt;br /&gt;So where did Amaranth’s risk – and the possibility of catastrophic loss – come in?  The answer’s &lt;br /&gt;simple:  &lt;br /&gt;Positions that are low in risk can be rendered quite risky with the help of leverage.   &lt;br /&gt;Back in ancient history (1998), a fixed income hedge fund called Long-Term Capital &lt;br /&gt;Management pursued arbitrage transactions like Am&lt;br /&gt;aranth’s (on a much more diversified basis &lt;br /&gt;but with more leverage) and experienced a similar meltdown.  I noted that earlier, when things &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;were going well, one of Long-Term’s principals had said, “We’re going around the world &lt;br /&gt;scooping up nickels and dimes.”  There’s great appeal to his notion of profiting from a large &lt;br /&gt;num&lt;br /&gt;ber of small mispricings that others aren’t smart enough to seize upon.  But he had left off a &lt;br /&gt;few key words from the end of his sentence: “. . . in front of a steamroller.”  The steamroller &lt;br /&gt;enters the picture when so much leverage is employed that a fund can’t survive a moment of &lt;br /&gt;aberrant market behavior. &lt;br /&gt;TIn a memo on hedge funds in October 2004, I mentioned that when there’s a big increase in the &lt;br /&gt;number of little fish attempting to live off each big fish’s leavings (or in the number of hedge &lt;br /&gt;funds relative to mainstream investors), the pickings become slimmer.  Given the increased &lt;br /&gt;efforts to exploit inefficiencies today and the fact that strong cash inflows and resultant high &lt;br /&gt;prices have depressed prospective returns in many markets, managers are often resorting to &lt;br /&gt;increased leverage in order to reach their return targets.  But it’s essential to remember that &lt;br /&gt;leverage is the ultimate two-edged sword: it doesn’t alter the probability of being right or &lt;br /&gt;wrong; it just magnifies the consequences of both. &lt;br /&gt;TUThe Perils of Diversification &lt;br /&gt;TThe Amaranth saga demonstrates that the riskiness of a portfolio is not just a function of the &lt;br /&gt;fundamental nature of its holdings, but also of things like concentration and leverage.  I often say &lt;br /&gt;there is no investment so good that it can’t be ruined by too-high an entry price.  There’s also no &lt;br /&gt;investment so safe that can’t be rendered risky by buying too much of it with borrowed &lt;br /&gt;money. &lt;br /&gt;TDiversification has long been considered a pillar of conservative investing.  It’s a simple &lt;br /&gt;concept: “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”  Spreading your capital among a number of &lt;br /&gt;assets or strategies reduces the likelihood of a disaster. &lt;br /&gt;TIn the 1960s, Bill Sharpe pointed out that adding in a risky but uncorrelated asset can reduce a &lt;br /&gt;portfolio’s overall riskiness.  It has become accepted wisdom that overall risk can be reduced &lt;br /&gt;(and return increased) by adding alternative investments to a portfolio of stocks and bonds. &lt;br /&gt;TBut people don’t always take note of a dangerous outgrowth of these dicta: that diversifying &lt;br /&gt;into uncorrelated assets with borrowed money can increase, not reduce, the risk of the &lt;br /&gt;portfolio. &lt;br /&gt;TLet’s say you have $100 invested in U.S. stocks.  You realize how undiversified your portfolio &lt;br /&gt;is, and that a market crash can bring a substantial loss.  So you sell off $75 worth of stocks and &lt;br /&gt;put $25 each into emerging market stocks, high yield bonds and natural gas futures.  Now your &lt;br /&gt;portfolio is invested equally in four asset classes rather than one and thus probably safer. &lt;br /&gt;TBut what if, instead, you hold onto your $100 worth of U.S. stocks and borrow another $300, &lt;br /&gt;investing $100 in each of those three new asset classes.  You’re again invested equally in four &lt;br /&gt;asset classes.  Equally diversified but much less safe.  That’s because leverage has magnified &lt;br /&gt;the sensitivity of your portfolio to market movements.   &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TA crash that wipes out one of the four asset classes in the diversified $100 portfolio will reduce &lt;br /&gt;your net worth by 25%.  But that same crash, when experienced in the leveraged and equally &lt;br /&gt;diversified $400 portfolio, will eliminate your entire net worth.  So investors should always &lt;br /&gt;consider the combined effect of diversification and leverage.  Amaranth was much safer when it &lt;br /&gt;was all in convertible arbitrage than after it increased its leverage in order to diversify into &lt;br /&gt;energy trading.  Diversification is a good thing, but a lot depends on how you finance it. &lt;br /&gt;T“Multi-strategy” is one of today’s hot buzz words.  But as Orin Kramer puts it (see page 12 for &lt;br /&gt;who he is), “Amaranth is a reminder that a multi-strategy structure is not a proxy for risk &lt;br /&gt;diversification.”  That is, I think, multi-strategy + risk control = protective diversification, while &lt;br /&gt;multi-strategy + leverage = more ways to lose. &lt;br /&gt;UGenerating Alpha &lt;br /&gt;I want to say up front that I have absolutely no idea how one dependably achieves above average &lt;br /&gt;profits from trading or investing in commodities, precious metals or currencies.  That’s not to say &lt;br /&gt;it can’t be done.  There are people who’ve gotten very rich that way, managing both their own &lt;br /&gt;money and that of others.   &lt;br /&gt;Of course, the efficient ma&lt;br /&gt;rket crowd would say someone will get rich doing everything – even &lt;br /&gt;playing the lottery or flipping coins – simply because the tails of a probability distribution &lt;br /&gt;usually aren’t entirely unpopulated.  But who it is that gets rich that way may be purely &lt;br /&gt;random.  If that’s the case, the mere existence of a few winners doesn’t in itself prove that &lt;br /&gt;something is an “alpha” activity in which hard work and skill will produce consistent &lt;br /&gt;performance, or that large numbers of people can pull it off.   &lt;br /&gt;I believe firmly that the markets for commodities and currencies are generally efficient.  That &lt;br /&gt;means a lot of highly motivated people participate; many are intelligent and computer-literate; &lt;br /&gt;they all have access to similar information; and they’re willing to take either side of most &lt;br /&gt;propositions.  These people cause all of the available information to instantly be incorporated in &lt;br /&gt;the market price of each asset, such that the market price always reflects the consensus view of &lt;br /&gt;the significance of the available information.  As a further consequence, few people if any can &lt;br /&gt;dependably identify and profit from instances when the market price is wrong.  That, in turn, &lt;br /&gt;makes it difficult to consistently achieve high absolute returns or perform better than &lt;br /&gt;others.  That difficulty constitutes the ultimate proof that a market’s efficient. &lt;br /&gt;Take currencies for example.  Exchange rates exist so that currencies will be valued fairly &lt;br /&gt;relative to each other in view of countries’ differing growth rates, interest rates, inflation &lt;br /&gt;prospects and fiscal and trade deficits, etc.  Further, exchange rates change as the outlook for &lt;br /&gt;these things changes.  Their current status is widely known, and predicting changes is something &lt;br /&gt;few people can do right more often than others.  Thus it seems unlikely that some people will be &lt;br /&gt;able to regularly generate higher returns than others. &lt;br /&gt;If it’s so hard to value cu&lt;br /&gt;rrencies, commodities and precious metals, why do I think we can &lt;br /&gt;invest intelligently in equities, corporate debt and whole companies?  It’s because these things &lt;br /&gt;generate income, and an expected stream of future income can be translated into a current value.  &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you determine the intrinsic value of a Euro, a bar of gold or a barrel of oil?  You can &lt;br /&gt;talk about the positives and the negatives associated with these goods.  But how do you convert &lt;br /&gt;those things into a price? &lt;br /&gt;For example, the factors that argue for high oil prices are obvious.  “The supply is finite.”  &lt;br /&gt;“We’re using it up at an accelerating rate.”  “Environmental issues in the U.S. will constrain the &lt;br /&gt;domestic supply.”  “Much of the foreign supply is in the hands of hostile or unpredictable &lt;br /&gt;governments: Iran’s a worry, Venezuela is turning anti-American, and Saudi Arabia is subject to &lt;br /&gt;instability.”  Sure they make oil a valuable good, but how valuable?  How do we know the &lt;br /&gt;current price doesn’t adequately reflect these things already?  What’s the &lt;br /&gt;UrightU price for it? &lt;br /&gt;We had a particularly instructive lesson in July.  The price of oil had been strong, and the &lt;br /&gt;outlook was for more of the same.  With the price at $77 per barrel, it was reported that the &lt;br /&gt;Alaskan pipeline had to be shut down to repair dama&lt;br /&gt;ge.  With domestic shipments restricted, the &lt;br /&gt;price had to rise; oil UhadU to be a buy.  But the $77 price at which oil traded on the day of the &lt;br /&gt;announcement hasn’t been seen since.  Within just four months, the price of oil fell to $55 (down &lt;br /&gt;28%) – and the factors listed above were just as true at $55 as they were at $77.  Without the &lt;br /&gt;ability to reliably convert fundamentals into prices, I don’t see how one can achieve consistently &lt;br /&gt;superior risk-adjusted gains.   &lt;br /&gt;Above average investment performance (in any market) has to be the result of either &lt;br /&gt;unusual insight into values or the intersection of risk taking and luck.  It’s hard to tell the &lt;br /&gt;difference between the two in the short run, but the truth always becomes clear in time, &lt;br /&gt;because luck rarely holds up for long. &lt;br /&gt;UThe Short-Term Performance Trap &lt;br /&gt;That leads me to Amaranth’s experience in natural gas, and to the key lesson to be learned from &lt;br /&gt;it.  Is anyone capable of regularly generating skilled-based (as opposed to luck-based) returns at &lt;br /&gt;an ultra-high level by trading natural gas?&lt;br /&gt;  I  don’t know for sure, but I would think not.   &lt;br /&gt;I’m not saying no money can be made that way.  But while the capital markets might permit one &lt;br /&gt;to steadily earn 5-8% a year (or maybe even 8-10%) by committing capital to this activity, &lt;br /&gt;returns in the teens should be infrequent, and returns above 20% probably should be &lt;br /&gt;considered the result of extreme good fortune (and thus as having been just as likely to go &lt;br /&gt;the other way).  There are exceptions, but a good statistician can live with a few exceptions &lt;br /&gt;without feeling they disprove the main point. &lt;br /&gt;I think it’s essential to realize that Amaranth’s troubles in natural gas didn’t start this &lt;br /&gt;year, with the positions that didn’t work.  The&lt;br /&gt;y started with the $1 billion in profits that &lt;br /&gt;Hunter generated in 2005, which permitted Amaranth to report a return roughly double &lt;br /&gt;that of the average hedge fund. &lt;br /&gt;TIn the investment business, clients love high returns and hate low returns.  That makes sense.  &lt;br /&gt;And when the market’s up 10% and their manager is up 20%, clients are really happy.  But that’s &lt;br /&gt;my pet peeve.  Rarely does anyone say, “Whoa.  That return’s too high.  How did it happen?  &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much risk did my manager take in order to generate that?”  No, in the investment world &lt;br /&gt;few people find high returns worrisome. &lt;br /&gt;TEveryone talks about beta, (which I’m tempted to pronounce “bee-tah” now that I’ve spent six &lt;br /&gt;weeks in London), but few people dwell on it when returns are soaring.  Credulous investors &lt;br /&gt;think the manager who generated 20% in an up-10% market contributed alpha of 10%.  But &lt;br /&gt;maybe he had zero alpha and a beta of 2 instead . . . or maybe negative alpha of 20% and a beta &lt;br /&gt;of 4.  Regardless, I almost never hear people talk about returns being so high that they’re suspect.   &lt;br /&gt;According to Hillary Till of Premia Capital Management (in her report on Amaranth published &lt;br /&gt;by France’s EDHEC Business School), “Since May, investors knew [Amaranth’s] energy &lt;br /&gt;portfolio had typical up or down months of about 11%. . . .  Therefore, it would not have been &lt;br /&gt;unusual for the fund’s energy trades to lose 24% in a single month. . . .”  But nobody seemed to &lt;br /&gt;care, since the energy book gained $2 billion in just the first four months of 2006.  In other &lt;br /&gt;words, Amaranth had enjoyed the up months.  That certainly didn’t imply that down months &lt;br /&gt;weren’t lurking.  In fact, just the opposite. &lt;br /&gt;THere’s the most important thing:  My wife Nancy often quotes a few lines from Rudyard &lt;br /&gt;Kipling’s poem, “If”:  &lt;br /&gt;TIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  &lt;br /&gt;TAnd treat those two Impostors just the same; . . .  &lt;br /&gt;TYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  &lt;br /&gt;TAnd – which is more – you’ll be a Man, my son! &lt;br /&gt;TLikewise, short-term gains and short-term losses are potential impostors, as neither is &lt;br /&gt;necessarily indicative of real investment ability (or the lack thereof). &lt;br /&gt;TSurprisingly good returns are often just the flip side of surprisingly bad returns.  One year with a &lt;br /&gt;great return can overstate the manager’s skill and obscure the risk he took.  Yet people are &lt;br /&gt;surprised when that great year is followed by a terrible year.  Investors invariably lose track of &lt;br /&gt;the fact that they both can be impostors, and of the importance of digging deep to understand &lt;br /&gt;what underlies them. &lt;br /&gt;TOne gets the impression that no one at Amaranth asked the right question when Brian &lt;br /&gt;Hunter shot the lights out in 2005:  “How’d you do that?”  Or if they asked, they were &lt;br /&gt;satisfied with what turned out to be the wrong answer: skill, rather than leveraged aggression &lt;br /&gt;combined with luck.  They let him move to Calgary, and they gave him a large enough capital &lt;br /&gt;and/or risk budget to enable him to bring down the firm.   &lt;br /&gt;TBut The Wall Street Journal of September 19 laid out how this came about.  “. . . late last year, &lt;br /&gt;the double-whammy of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made Mr. Hunter a hero at Amaranth and a &lt;br /&gt;minor legend on Wall Street, as he made $1 billion for Amaranth.”  Hunter liked to buy deep-&lt;br /&gt;out-of-the-money options.  While these things expire worthless most of the time, a major, &lt;br /&gt;unexpected price move in the underlying asset can produce huge profits. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBut does betting on a long shot and profiting from a freak occurrence make someone a &lt;br /&gt;skilled investor, or just the “lucky idiot” that Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes in “Fooled &lt;br /&gt;by Randomness”?  Should that kind of performance inspire reverence or concern?  Well, &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth’s 2005 gas profits produced awe, but anyone looking behind them should have been &lt;br /&gt;worried.  What would have happened, investors might have asked, if events had unfolded &lt;br /&gt;differently?  Taleb’s “alternative histories” are always worthy of consideration (see below). &lt;br /&gt;TThe events in the gas market that decimated Amaranth in 2006 may have been unforeseeable and &lt;br /&gt;unprecedented.  But those adjectives might apply just as well to the elements that made it &lt;br /&gt;successful in 2005, and no one – especially not the fund’s managers – seems to have mentioned &lt;br /&gt;that fact at the time.  When people profit from such things, it’s considered all right and good, but &lt;br /&gt;then when they reverse into losses, it comes as a shock.  They’re two sides of the same coin, &lt;br /&gt;but investors have a really tough time keeping that in mind. &lt;br /&gt;UWhat’s Real? &lt;br /&gt;To be able to attach the proper significance to short-run performance, it’s essential that one &lt;br /&gt;understand the idea of “alternative histories.”  I came across it in Taleb’s book, which I consider &lt;br /&gt;the bible on such topics.   &lt;br /&gt;This concept is related to Orin Kramer’s description of Tpast performance as “the interaction of &lt;br /&gt;particular historical and market conditions and the judgments and beliefs of managers during that &lt;br /&gt;period.”  In other words, investment performance is what happens to a portfolio when &lt;br /&gt;events unfold.  People pay great heed to the resulting performance, but the questions they should &lt;br /&gt;ask are, “Were the events that unfolded (and the other possibilities that didn’t unfold) truly &lt;br /&gt;within the ken of the portfolio manager?  And what would the performance have been if other &lt;br /&gt;events had occurred instead?”  Those other events are Taleb’s “alternative histories.”  How &lt;br /&gt;about an example of the right way to view outcomes?  &lt;br /&gt;TWell, with the college football bowl &lt;br /&gt;season upon us, I’d like to discuss last year’s championship game, something I’ve been musing &lt;br /&gt;about for almost a year.   &lt;br /&gt;The University of Southern California football team was undefeated in the 2005 regular season.  &lt;br /&gt;It boasted two successive years’ Heisman Trophy winners and many other great players.  It won &lt;br /&gt;its games in spectacular fashion and was widely touted as one of the best college football teams &lt;br /&gt;of all time.  In fact, in the week leading up to the championship game against the University of &lt;br /&gt;Texas, ESPN ran daily segments that compared USC against a top team from the past, each time &lt;br /&gt;stating that USC was better, and why. &lt;br /&gt;When it came down to game time, however, Texa&lt;br /&gt;s played very well and USC couldn’t contain &lt;br /&gt;their talented quarterback, Vince Young.  With two minutes to go in the game, holding a slim &lt;br /&gt;five-point lead, USC’s coach, Pete Carroll, chose to “go for it” on fourth down, rather than punt &lt;br /&gt;the ball downfield – undoubtedly out of concern that if Texas got the ball with two minutes left &lt;br /&gt;on the clock, his team would be unable to keep them from scoring.  USC failed to make a first &lt;br /&gt;down, and Texas got the ball with good field position, scored a touchdown and won the game. &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If USC had made the two yards they needed on that fourth down play, it’s extremely likely they &lt;br /&gt;would have won the game.  And if they’d won the game, they doubtless would be described &lt;br /&gt;today as the best college football team in history.  But it didn’t happen that way, and no one talks &lt;br /&gt;anymore about their being the best, or even the second best.  Now they’re considered just another &lt;br /&gt;great team&lt;br /&gt;.  What this shows is how tenuous the connection can be between outcomes &lt;br /&gt;(which most people take for reality) and the real, underlying reality.  What do I mean by that &lt;br /&gt;distinction? &lt;br /&gt;Consider this:  What’s the probability that if USC had made the needed two yards – and today &lt;br /&gt;was considered the best team ever – they really would be the best team ever?  Certainly not &lt;br /&gt;100%.  And just as interestingly (or to me maybe more so), what’s the probability that, even &lt;br /&gt;though they didn’t make the two yards, they actually are the best team that ever played?  &lt;br /&gt;Certainly not zero.  But since USC lost that game, most people would find nonsensical a &lt;br /&gt;suggestion that they’re the best team in history.  To contemplate that possibility, they would have &lt;br /&gt;to consider an alternative history in which USC made those two yards. &lt;br /&gt;Can the result of one play really decide the issue?  That’s the one thing we all can probably agree &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t be the case.  “Everyone knows” that th&lt;br /&gt;e score of a game doesn’t necessarily tell you &lt;br /&gt;which is the better team.  So then outcomes aren’t necessarily indicative of reality, meaning that &lt;br /&gt;alternative histories should be given significant weight.  (I guess the ultimate step would be to &lt;br /&gt;suggest that USC actually won the game, the score notwithstanding.  That would be going too far &lt;br /&gt;. . . although we often hear a losing team’s fans say, “We won that game.”) &lt;br /&gt;While we’re looking deeply into things, let’s spend a minute on Pete Carroll’s decision to go for &lt;br /&gt;it on fourth down.  Was he right or wrong?  He has gone for it on fourth down m&lt;br /&gt;any times in his &lt;br /&gt;coaching career, and most of the time it worked.  In fact, USC twice had run on fourth down &lt;br /&gt;earlier in the championship game, making the needed yardage once and scoring a touchdown.  &lt;br /&gt;But on that final attempt they were unsuccessful.  Does that mean Pete made a wrong decision?  &lt;br /&gt;Or was it a right decision that just happened not to work on that occasion?  One of the first things &lt;br /&gt;I learned at Wharton in 1963 was that you can’t judge the correctness of a decision from the &lt;br /&gt;outcome.  This is another concept that many people find nonsensical.  But good decisions fail to &lt;br /&gt;work all the time – just as bad ones lead to success – simply because it’s so hard to predict which &lt;br /&gt;history will materialize. &lt;br /&gt;It seems ridiculous for something as momentous as the label “best team ever” – and the &lt;br /&gt;measure of a team’s real worth over an entire season – to hinge on the outcome of one play &lt;br /&gt;that took four seconds.  Clearly that’s a distortion, but no less of a distortion than many &lt;br /&gt;people’s response to short-term investment performance, both good and bad. &lt;br /&gt;UKing for a Day &lt;br /&gt;TIn the current environment, there can be little ability to restrain a hot manager.  According to &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth’s head of Human Resources until 2004, the CEO of the fund “. . . sought to centralize &lt;br /&gt;oversight of traders and keep big discretionary trading authority on the fund’s Greenwich trading &lt;br /&gt;floor.  After big gains in 2005, Mr. Hunter was allowed to trade from Calgary.  ‘To have a &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relative newcomer . . . receive so much discretion is just sho&lt;br /&gt;cking to me.’ ” (The Wall Street &lt;br /&gt;Journal, September 20) &lt;br /&gt;TBut today, if a hedge fund CEO tells a trader who’s been generating great performance that he &lt;br /&gt;can’t have more capital, or take risky positions, or pursue the maximum imaginable incentive &lt;br /&gt;fee, or move to Calgary, he’ll lose him.  There’s always another employer who’ll meet a hot &lt;br /&gt;trader’s demands.  No, this isn’t a time when discipline and risk control come easy. &lt;br /&gt;TIn this climate, even an earlier dust-up at Deutsche Bank regarding Brian Hunter’s gas trading &lt;br /&gt;and bonus wasn’t enough to keep him from becoming the linchpin of a $9.5 billion fund, &lt;br /&gt;managing half its capital.  And it wouldn’t have deterred others from hiring him if he quit &lt;br /&gt;because Amaranth had tried to restrain him. &lt;br /&gt;TA decade ago, if an employee who’d run up big profits in his first year asked for a huge bonus, &lt;br /&gt;we’d say, “Come back after you’ve put together a few good years.”  But in today’s climate, if a &lt;br /&gt;hedge fund doesn’t come up with an out-sized bonus after one good year, it’s unlikely the &lt;br /&gt;employee will stick around to give it a second.  Thus Brian Hunter was paid $75 to $100 &lt;br /&gt;million in 2005, his first full year at Amaranth, arguably for betting right on the weather. &lt;br /&gt;TIt doesn’t take much to be venerated today.  One or two good years make somebody a “top &lt;br /&gt;trader.”  Three years can enable someone to raise a billion-dollar hedge fund.  In fact, even after &lt;br /&gt;the fall, The Wall Street Journal described Brian Hunter as an “experienced manager” . . . at 32.  &lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t anyone think that before someone is elevated to the investment peerage, he or she should &lt;br /&gt;have a record spanning more than a few years, and have been tested in down markets?  I knew &lt;br /&gt;the world had been turned on its head when I read on “dailyii.com” about Hedge Funds &lt;br /&gt;Investment Management, a London fund of funds that will invest only with people who’ve been &lt;br /&gt;in the business for 3½ years or less. &lt;br /&gt;TUUnlikely Things Happen &lt;br /&gt;TThe EDHEC report mentioned above makes a number of interesting observations concerning &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth’s portfolio: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TAs of June 2006, energy trades accounted for about half of Amaranth’s capital and generated &lt;br /&gt;75% of its profits.   &lt;br /&gt; TAmaranth had 6,700 energy positions, leveraged 4.5 to one, including open positions to buy &lt;br /&gt;or sell tens of billions of dollars of commodities. &lt;br /&gt; TAmaranth was responsible for a substantial portion of all of the gas trades that took place. &lt;br /&gt; TIn the far-out months, in which fewer traders participate, “the fund’s positions were indeed &lt;br /&gt;massive.” &lt;br /&gt; TMany of Amaranth’s trades probably had “physical-market participants” on the other side, &lt;br /&gt;people who had taken positions to hedge risks intrinsic to their business.  Because they would &lt;br /&gt;be unlikely to unwind their trades at Amaranth’s convenience, exits were problematic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TIn view of all of the above, “the magnitude of Amaranth’s energy position-taking was &lt;br /&gt;inappropriate relative to its capital base.” &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THillary Till describes Amaranth’s loss as a 9-standard-deviation event (Long-Term Capital’s is &lt;br /&gt;estimated at “8-sigma”).  By way of reference, 5 standard deviations include the central &lt;br /&gt;99.99994% of a &lt;br /&gt;Tnormal probability distribution.  A 5-sigma event below that range should &lt;br /&gt;happen about three times in every ten million trials (thus a given daily occurrence should happen &lt;br /&gt;once every 10,000 years).  But it’s amazing how often this kind of event seems to occur when &lt;br /&gt;derivatives are combined with leverage. &lt;br /&gt;TEveryone speaks about preparing for “worst-case” outcomes, but invariably things can get even &lt;br /&gt;worse.  Statistical reassurance should be relied on only to a reasonable extent.  Common sense &lt;br /&gt;has to come into play as well.   &lt;br /&gt;TURisk Management and Risk Managers  &lt;br /&gt;TYou know from my memo of February entitled “Risk” that I’m not a big fan of quantitative risk &lt;br /&gt;management.  It’s often said of a man that “he knows the price of everything but the value of &lt;br /&gt;nothing” – and it’s not meant as a compliment.  Likewise, I feel effective assessment of portfolio &lt;br /&gt;risk is less likely to come from Ph.D. statisticians who lack intimate knowledge of the assets in &lt;br /&gt;the portfolio than through wise judgments made subjectively by investors possessing “alpha.” &lt;br /&gt;TIn the memo on risk, I enumerated several criteria that should be present if modeling is to prove &lt;br /&gt;effective.  I also observed that most of them are lacking in the investment world.  In an article in &lt;br /&gt;the Financial Times of October 10, John Kay wrote of the risk that arises because of “uncertainty &lt;br /&gt;about whether the model you have developed describes the world accurately.”  He concluded &lt;br /&gt;that “mathematical modeling of risk can be an aid to sound judgment but never a complete &lt;br /&gt;substitute.”  My first boss, George Egbert, Jr., Citibank’s Director of Research in the 1960s, &lt;br /&gt;used to say of economists, “They should be on tap but not on top.”  Reliance on risk modeling &lt;br /&gt;should be similarly limited. &lt;br /&gt;T“What Brian is really good at is taking controlled and measured risk.”   Thus spoke Nick &lt;br /&gt;Maounis, the CEO of Amaranth, less than a month before its collapse.  He cited the more than a &lt;br /&gt;dozen members of his risk management team who served as a check on his star gas trader, and he &lt;br /&gt;said “spreads and options are of their very nature instruments for positions which are designed to &lt;br /&gt;allow the user to capture upside with a much clearer understanding with respect to downside &lt;br /&gt;exposure” (The Wall Street Journal of September 19 and 20).  But in the end, outsized profit &lt;br /&gt;potential without risk turned out to be a pipe dream as usual.   &lt;br /&gt;TAmaranth’s systems didn’t appear to measure correctly how much risk it faced &lt;br /&gt;and what steps would limit losses effectively.  The risk models employed by &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds employ historic data, but the natural gas markets have been more &lt;br /&gt;volatile this year than any year since 2001, making models less useful.  They also &lt;br /&gt;might not predict how much selling of one’s stakes to get out of a position can &lt;br /&gt;cause prices to fall.   &lt;br /&gt;T“It was a total failure of risk control to put your entire business at risk and not &lt;br /&gt;seem to know it,” says Marc Freed [of Lyster Watson &amp; Co., an advisory firm that &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invests in hedge funds].  “They were more leveraged than they realized.”  (The &lt;br /&gt;Wall Street Journal, September 20) &lt;br /&gt;TAfter the fall, the Journal quotes Mr. Maounis as saying Amaranth’s traders “were surprised not &lt;br /&gt;only by adverse market moves that triggered the losses but also by the lack of ability to exit the &lt;br /&gt;losing positions.”   That’s it, right there: the word “surprise.”  It’s one thing to make an &lt;br /&gt;investment you know is risky and have it come out wrong.  It’s something entirely different to &lt;br /&gt;make an investment that entails risk of which you’re unaware.   &lt;br /&gt;TMr. Maounis and Amaranth’s risk managers shouldn’t have been surprised.  They should have &lt;br /&gt;been alerted by the volatility of the fund’s energy results.  According to Till, its LPs should have &lt;br /&gt;been as well.  “Investors would not have needed position-level transparency to realize that &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth’s energy trading was quite risky.”  But the evidence of that potential risk came &lt;br /&gt;primarily in the form of outsized gains, and these are rarely recognized as the red flag they &lt;br /&gt;are. &lt;br /&gt;TAmaranth’s investors relied heavily on its vaunted risk management capability and on the &lt;br /&gt;assurance that risk was under control.  But the fund failed to survive its seventh year.  &lt;br /&gt;Quantitative risk managers can only opine on whether a disaster is likely or not.  Even if they’re &lt;br /&gt;right about that, it’s up to you to decide whether you’re willing to bear the risk of an improbable &lt;br /&gt;disaster.  They do happen! &lt;br /&gt;TUClassic Investment Mistakes &lt;br /&gt;THemlines go up and down.  Ties go from wide to narrow and back again.  There are only so &lt;br /&gt;many ways in which things can vary.  Likewise, there are only a few mistakes one can make in &lt;br /&gt;investing, and people repeat them over and over.  It seems Amaranth made several. &lt;br /&gt; TBorrowing short to buy long (and illiquid).  This cardinal sin is at the root of most great &lt;br /&gt;investment debacles.  A fund’s capital should be as long-lived as its commitments.  And no &lt;br /&gt;fund should promise more liquidity than is provided by its underlying assets.  You can &lt;br /&gt;successfully invest in volatile assets if you’re sure of being able to ride out a storm.  But if &lt;br /&gt;you lack that certainty and face the possibility of withdrawals or margin calls, a little &lt;br /&gt;volatility can mean the end.  In the case of Amaranth, just as had been true of Long-Term &lt;br /&gt;Capital Management and the big junk bond holders that were forced to sell out at the 1990 &lt;br /&gt;lows, many of the losses would have turned back into profits if they had just been able to &lt;br /&gt;hold on through the crisis.  That’s why I always caution, “Never forget the six-foot-tall man &lt;br /&gt;who drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on average.”  It’s not enough to be &lt;br /&gt;able to get through on average; you have to be able to survive life’s low points. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TConfusing paper profits with real gains.  The Wall Street Journal of September 20 points &lt;br /&gt;out that Hunter was encouraged by the positive marks to market showing up in his &lt;br /&gt;statements, so much so that he added further to his positions.  But he seems not to have asked &lt;br /&gt;whether the gains were real and realizable.  The Journal also points out that Hunter was such &lt;br /&gt;a big buyer in thin markets that his buying often supported prices and created the very profits &lt;br /&gt;he found so encouraging.  But if the profits were the product of his buying, and thus &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dependent on it for their continued existence, he clearly had no way to realize them.  My &lt;br /&gt;father used to tell a joke about the guy who insisted that his hamster was worth thousands &lt;br /&gt;more than he had paid for it.  “Then you should sell it&lt;br /&gt;,” his friend urged.  “Yeah,” he &lt;br /&gt;responded, “but to whom?” &lt;br /&gt;Being seduced by loss limitation.  Hunter is said to have liked buying deep-out-of-the-&lt;br /&gt;money options, and everyone knows that one great thing about buying options is that in&lt;br /&gt;exchange for a small option premium you receive the right to benefit from price movements&lt;br /&gt;on &lt;br /&gt;lots of assets.  You can only lose 100% of the amount you put up . . . and in deep-out-of-&lt;br /&gt;the-money options people do just that all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Misjudging liquidity.  People often ask me whether a given market is liquid or not.  My&lt;br /&gt;answer is usually, “that depends on which side you’re on.”  Markets are usually liquid in one&lt;br /&gt;direction or the other but not necessarily both.  When everyone is selling, a buyer’s liquidity&lt;br /&gt;is &lt;br /&gt;great, but a seller will find the going difficult.  When sellers’ urgency increases, they’re&lt;br /&gt;likely to have to give on price in order to achieve the “immediacy” they crave (see my memo&lt;br /&gt;“Investment Miscellany,” November 16, &lt;br /&gt;2000).  If their desire for immediacy is extreme, the&lt;br /&gt;bids they see might be absurdly low.  Thus markets can’t be counted on to accommodate a&lt;br /&gt;seller’s need to realize fair value.&lt;br /&gt;Ignoring the impact of others.  In small markets, everyone may know about your trades.&lt;br /&gt;That means they can copy them (making buying tough and adding to the crowd that will&lt;br /&gt;eventually jam the exits), and they can deny you fair prices if they know you have to sell.&lt;br /&gt;Aggressive traders, especially at hedge funds, don’t wear &lt;br /&gt;kid gloves.&lt;br /&gt;Underestimating correlation.  There’s another old saying: “In times of crisis, all&lt;br /&gt;correlations go to one.”  It means that assets with no fundamental or economic connection&lt;br /&gt;can be caused by market conditions to move in lockstep.  If a hedge fund experiences heavy&lt;br /&gt;withdrawals during a period of illiquidity, assets of various types may have to be dumped at&lt;br /&gt;once, and thus they can all decline together.  Further, hidden fault lines in portfolios can&lt;br /&gt;produce unexpected co-movement.  Let’s say you’re long sugar and gas, two unrelated&lt;br /&gt;commodities.  Unusually warm weather can reduce the demand for gas for heating and also&lt;br /&gt;cause a record sugar crop (as happened this year).  Thus the prices of &lt;br /&gt;seemingly unrelated&lt;br /&gt;goods can decline together.  Intelligent diversification doesn’t mean just owning different&lt;br /&gt;things; it means owning things that will respond differently to &lt;br /&gt;a given set of&lt;br /&gt;environmental factors.  Thus it requires a thorough understanding of potential&lt;br /&gt;connections.&lt;br /&gt;The case of Amaranth is highly and painfully instructive, and it bears out another of my favorite &lt;br /&gt;expressions:  Experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted. &lt;br /&gt;*     *     *&lt;br /&gt;Orin Kramer m&lt;br /&gt;anages the Kramer-Spellman hedge fund and, more famously, chairs the State of &lt;br /&gt;New Jersey Investment Council, which &lt;br /&gt;oversees the state’s $80 billion pension fund.  He is &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extremely knowledgeable concerning risk and return, herd behavior and the vicissitudes of &lt;br /&gt;investing in an institutional setting.  In a speech a few weeks ago, he made some excellent &lt;br /&gt;points: &lt;br /&gt;TMy own view is that we exaggerate the utility of standard performance measures.  &lt;br /&gt;In general, past performance reflects the interaction of particular historical and &lt;br /&gt;market conditions and the judgments and beliefs of managers during that period.  &lt;br /&gt;In particular, managers may consciously or unconsciously pursue strategies which &lt;br /&gt;assume the risk of low-frequency, high-severity outcomes.  Strategies which can &lt;br /&gt;only be torpedoed by low-frequency events will mostly produce favorable &lt;br /&gt;outcomes; identifying the tail risk implicit in such strategies is an extraordinary &lt;br /&gt;challenge.  The absence of the severe negative outcome is not, regrettably, &lt;br /&gt;proof that it cannot occur.  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;TIn other words, (1) short-term investment performance is not a helpful indicator of ability, (2) &lt;br /&gt;good results can arise just because a manager chose a high-risk course and was bailed out by &lt;br /&gt;events, and (3) that same course could just as easily have led to disaster . . . and certainly could &lt;br /&gt;do so next time.  However, it’s rare for either managers or clients to recognize the unreliability &lt;br /&gt;implicit in short-term results, especially when they’re good.  &lt;br /&gt;TOrin also notes that Amaranth “occurred when the skies were blue; the fund unraveled because a &lt;br /&gt;small and volatile commodity behaved in an unpredicted fashion.”  This collapse didn’t require &lt;br /&gt;an adverse economic environment or a market crash.  The combination of arrogance, failure to &lt;br /&gt;understand and allow for risk, and a small adverse development can be enough to wreak havoc.  &lt;br /&gt;It can happen to anyone who doesn’t spend the time and effort required to understand the &lt;br /&gt;processes underlying his portfolio. &lt;br /&gt;December 7, 2006 &lt;br /&gt;2006 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Race to the Bottom &lt;br /&gt;UCheapening Money &lt;br /&gt;If you make cars and want to sell more of them over the long term – that is, take &lt;br /&gt;permanent market share from your com&lt;br /&gt;petitors – you’ll try to make your product better.  &lt;br /&gt;(You might cut your prices or increase your advertising, but neither of those will work for &lt;br /&gt;long if your cars are demonstrably inferior.)  “Building a better mousetrap” should also &lt;br /&gt;be effective for sellers of toothpaste, computers, televisions, magazines, movies and &lt;br /&gt;dresses, or any other product that can be differentiated from its competitors.  That’s why &lt;br /&gt;– one way or the other – most sales pitches say, “Ours is better.”&lt;br /&gt;However, there are products that can’t be differentiated, and economists call them &lt;br /&gt;“commodities.”  These are generic goods like gold, West Texas crude oil, pork bellies, &lt;br /&gt;steel ingot, orange juice, electricity and telecommunications bandwidth.  They’re goods &lt;br /&gt;where no seller’s offering is much different from any other.  They tend to trade on price &lt;br /&gt;alone, and each buyer is likely to take the offering at the lowest delivered price. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, if you deal in a commodity and want to sell more of it, there’s generally one way to &lt;br /&gt;do so: cut your price.  It’s futile to make claims for product superiority, and advertising is &lt;br /&gt;unlikely to alter buying habits.  Thus in order to gain market share, you have to make &lt;br /&gt;your product cheaper than someone else’s. &lt;br /&gt;It helps to think of money as a commodity just like those others.  Everyone’s money is &lt;br /&gt;pretty much the same.  Yet institutions seeking to add to loan volume, and private &lt;br /&gt;equity funds and hedge funds seeking to increase their fees (see “The New Paradigm”), &lt;br /&gt;all want to move more of it.  So if you want to place more money – that is, get people &lt;br /&gt;to go to you instead of your competitors for their financing – you have to make your &lt;br /&gt;money cheaper.  As with the other commodities, low price is the most dependable route &lt;br /&gt;to increased market share. &lt;br /&gt;One way to lower the price for your money is by reducing the interest rate you charge on &lt;br /&gt;loans.  A slightly more subtle way is to agree to a higher price for the thing you’re &lt;br /&gt;buying, such as by paying a higher p/e ratio for a common stock or a higher total &lt;br /&gt;transaction price when you’re buying a company.  Any way you slice it, you’re settling &lt;br /&gt;for a lower prospective return.  But there are other ways to cheapen your money, &lt;br /&gt;and they’re the primar&lt;br /&gt;y subject of this memo. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCongratulations! &lt;br /&gt;What else is there – besides return – that you can accept less of in order to &lt;br /&gt;accelerate the pace at which you put out your money?  The answer is simple: safety.  &lt;br /&gt;So a provider of capital who wants to increase market share – that is, make a bigger &lt;br /&gt;percentage of the loans or investments that are made – will accept risks that others won’t.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s another way to get the deal instead of having it go to someone else. &lt;br /&gt;I sometimes buy at auctions.  When the bidding’s over, the auction house personnel come &lt;br /&gt;up and say “congratulations.”  I usually say, “On what?  All I did is pay more than &lt;br /&gt;anyone else would pay.”  That’s how auctions work – most market mechanisms, in fact:  &lt;br /&gt;the deal goes to the person who’ll pay the most for the goods (or, looked at &lt;br /&gt;conversely, get the least for his money).  The capital markets are no different.   &lt;br /&gt;Of course, when the subject is price, it’s obvious that the person who’s willing to pay the &lt;br /&gt;most wins the auction.  It’s a little more subtle that, when it comes to quality and safety, &lt;br /&gt;the person who’ll accept the least is likely to be congratulated as the “winner.”  Winner in &lt;br /&gt;quotes, that is, because in putting out capital, the person who gets the deal is likely to &lt;br /&gt;be a loser if he accepts a level of safety that turns out to be inadequate. &lt;br /&gt;That leads me to one of my pet peeves.  The “industry rags” in private equity are devoted &lt;br /&gt;alm&lt;br /&gt;ost exclusively to reporting who bought what company, with accounts of how &lt;br /&gt;competitors were outbid and innovative financing arranged.  But the articles should focus &lt;br /&gt;instead on whether the price was right, and the champagne should probably be kept on ice &lt;br /&gt;until the company has been sold at a profit.  Buying shows who was the highest bidder, &lt;br /&gt;not necessarily the smartest bidder. &lt;br /&gt;(Let me hasten to point out here that while I generalize as usual for simplicity and effect, &lt;br /&gt;there are always exceptions.  Oaktree routinely gains admittance to deals because we &lt;br /&gt;provide prompt commitments, certainty of closure, assistance in structuring and/or the &lt;br /&gt;promise of constructive behavior should problems arise.  But much of the time – &lt;br /&gt;especially today – deals go to the capital providers who’ll pay the most and/or accept the &lt;br /&gt;least.  We try to gain access to deals by adding value, not by paying the most.) &lt;br /&gt;UThe Auction’s On &lt;br /&gt;While the last few years have given me many opportunities to marvel at excesses in the &lt;br /&gt;capital markets, in this case the one that elicited my battle c&lt;br /&gt;ry – “that calls for a memo” – &lt;br /&gt;hit the newspapers in England during my last stay.  As the Financial Times reported on &lt;br /&gt;November 1,  &lt;br /&gt;Abbey, the UK’s second-largest home loans provider, has raised the &lt;br /&gt;standard amount it will lend homebuyers to five times either their single or &lt;br /&gt;joint salaries, eclipsing the traditional borrowing levels of around three &lt;br /&gt;and a half tim&lt;br /&gt;es salary.  It followed last week’s decision by Bank of &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland Mortgages and Bristol and West to increase standard salary &lt;br /&gt;multiples from four to 4.5 times. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, there had been a traditional rule of thumb saying that borrowers can &lt;br /&gt;safely handle mortgages with a face amount equal to three-plus times their salaries.  But &lt;br /&gt;now they can have five times – roughly 50% more.  What inference should be drawn?  &lt;br /&gt;There are at least four possibilities: &lt;br /&gt;1. The old standard was too conservative, and the new one’s right;&lt;br /&gt;2. Conditions have changed, such that the new standard is as conservative for today as&lt;br /&gt;the old one was for its times;&lt;br /&gt;3. It’s reasonable for mortgage lenders to accept higher default experience, and thus&lt;br /&gt;lower net returns, because their cost&lt;br /&gt; of capital has declined; or&lt;br /&gt;4. The rush to place money has caused a supplier of capital to loosen its standards.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am no expert on the UK mortgage market, and it’s my&lt;br /&gt; intention in this memo to &lt;br /&gt;comment on general capital market trends, not any one sector.  Further, it’s certainly true &lt;br /&gt;that today’s lower interest rates mean a given salary can support a bigger mortgage (and &lt;br /&gt;that’s likely to hold true so long as (1) borrowers keep their jobs and (2) their mortgages &lt;br /&gt;carry fixed rates).  But if you think Abbey’s reason for taking this step might be a logical &lt;br /&gt;one like that, the question to ask is “why now?”   &lt;br /&gt;Logical reasons and sober decision making might be involved here.  But so might &lt;br /&gt;competition to put out money and the usual late-stage belief that “it’s different this &lt;br /&gt;time.”  Lenders and investors invariably depart from time-honored disciplines when &lt;br /&gt;cycles move to extremes, out of a belief that current conditions are different from &lt;br /&gt;those that prevailed in the past, when those disciplines were appropriate.  And just &lt;br /&gt;as invariably, they’re shown that cycles repeat and nothing really changes. &lt;br /&gt;What did we see in the U.S. mortgage market as home prices rose and interest rates &lt;br /&gt;declined?  First, low teaser rates.  Then higher loan-to-value ratios.  Then 100% &lt;br /&gt;financing.  Then low-amortization loans.  Then no-amortization loans.  Then loans &lt;br /&gt;requiring no documentation of employment or credit history.  These things made it &lt;br /&gt;possible for more buyers to stretch for more expensive homes, but at the same time they &lt;br /&gt;made mortgages riskier for lenders.  And these developments took place when home &lt;br /&gt;prices were at sky-high and interest rates were at multi-generation lows.  In the end, &lt;br /&gt;buyers took out the biggest mortgage possible given their incomes and prevailing interest &lt;br /&gt;rates.  Such mortgages would land them in the houses of their dreams . . . and leave them &lt;br /&gt;there for as long as conditions didn’t deteriorate, which they invariably do. &lt;br /&gt;Do you remember the game Bid-a-Note from the TV show “Name that Tune”?  &lt;br /&gt;Contestant x said, “I can name that tune in six notes.”  Then contestant y said, “I can &lt;br /&gt;name that tune in five notes.”  Then contestant x said, “I can name that tune in four &lt;br /&gt;notes.”  The contestant who eventually got the chance to guess the name of the tune was &lt;br /&gt;the one who was willing to accept the riskiest proposition – to try on the basis of the least &lt;br /&gt;information. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Bank of Ireland entered the competiti&lt;br /&gt;on to lend money for home purchases and &lt;br /&gt;said, “I’ll lend four and a half times the borrower’s salary.”  And Abbey said, “I’ll lend &lt;br /&gt;five times.”  The so-called winner in this auction is the one who’ll put out the most &lt;br /&gt;money with the least safety.  Whether that’s really winning or losing will become clear &lt;br /&gt;when the cycle turns, as it did in the U.S. last year.  But certainly there’s a race to the &lt;br /&gt;bottom going on . . . a contest to become the institution that’ll make loans with the &lt;br /&gt;slightest margin for error. &lt;br /&gt;By the way, were the people who made those U.S. mortgages loans big losers?  Defaults &lt;br /&gt;spiked last year, but often the originators of the loans had escaped by selling the loans &lt;br /&gt;onward to others, some of whom packaged them into mortgage-backed securities or &lt;br /&gt;CLOs and sold them once again or borrowed against them on a non-recourse basis.  Since &lt;br /&gt;many of the people who make loans today flip them quickly, an aspect of “moral hazard” &lt;br /&gt;has entered the equation, in which decision makers are insulated from the consequences &lt;br /&gt;of their actions. &lt;br /&gt;Any way you slice it, standards for mortgage loans have dropped in recent years, &lt;br /&gt;and risk has increased.  Logic-based?  Perhaps.  Cycle-induced (and exacerbated)?  &lt;br /&gt;I’d say so.  The FT quoted John Paul Crutchley, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, as &lt;br /&gt;saying “When Abbey are lending a multiple of five times salary, that could be perfectly &lt;br /&gt;sensible – or it could be tremendously risky.”  Certainly mortgage lending was made &lt;br /&gt;riskier.  We’ll see in a few years whether that was intelligent risk taking or excessive &lt;br /&gt;competitive ardor.   &lt;br /&gt;UEveryone’s Got a Favorite &lt;br /&gt;A lot of Oaktree’s activities center around buying bonds, making loans and trying to &lt;br /&gt;profit when debt that others hold goes bad.  So who better than my colleagues for me to &lt;br /&gt;turn to for examples of m&lt;br /&gt;istakes in the making?  I asked for examples of the race to the &lt;br /&gt;bottom, and the response was immediate and substantial.  I won’t embarrass individual &lt;br /&gt;issuers or borrowers by describing specific transactions; the names have been omitted to &lt;br /&gt;protect the guilty.  But here are some of the themes our people told me about: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UHot potatoU – There’s big money today in buying companies and then having them &lt;br /&gt;borrow money with which to pay you a dividend, even if doing so reduces the &lt;br /&gt;companies’ creditworthiness.  Just a few years back, companies generally wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;have been able to issue bonds or loans where the projected use of proceeds was &lt;br /&gt;dividends to their equity owners.  But since people are so eager to invest today, &lt;br /&gt;they’ll lend to companies where much or all of the equity paid in – or maybe more &lt;br /&gt;than all of it – will be dividended out.  They’re doing so on the expectation that &lt;br /&gt;they’ll be able to exit before risk turns into loss.  “If things take a turn for the &lt;br /&gt;worse, I’ll get out” is a refrain that accompanies most market excesses (tech &lt;br /&gt;stocks in 1999 and condos in 2005 come immediately to mind), but rarely does it &lt;br /&gt;turn out that way. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; UHeads We Win/Tails You LoseU – Part of being willing to pay more for less relates to &lt;br /&gt;the balance between upside potential, downside risk and who gets what.  SPACs – or &lt;br /&gt;Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, also known as “blank check companies” or &lt;br /&gt;“blind pools” – seem like a good example of miscalibration.  People put equity capital &lt;br /&gt;into a SPAC with no certainty as to what will be done with it.  The SPAC’s &lt;br /&gt;“portfolio” is likely to consist of just one company.  And the investors will get no &lt;br /&gt;return on their money as long as it remains unspent, which can be up to 18 or 24 &lt;br /&gt;months.  The sponsor, on the other hand, gets 20% of any profits, as there’s no &lt;br /&gt;preferred return.  It does so through warrants, which it can liquidate even without &lt;br /&gt;having sold the acquired company.  And if it can’t make an acquisition, it just returns &lt;br /&gt;the money without penalty – usually reduced by banking and other fees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UNot My ProblemU – One of the stories I was told pertained to a company whose &lt;br /&gt;accounting problems had prevented it from issuing audited financial statements for a &lt;br /&gt;relatively long period of time.  After the company went bankrupt, we were &lt;br /&gt;determined to learn more about its accounting issues than anyone else and then &lt;br /&gt;intelligently make a debtor-in-possession loan, through which we might gain &lt;br /&gt;ownership of the company.  But before we could make the loan, someone else made &lt;br /&gt;the company a better offer: more leverage on cheaper terms, with no provision for &lt;br /&gt;accounting due diligence.  When later we were able to ask about why we had lost out, &lt;br /&gt;we were told that one reason the other lender was able to be more aggressive than &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree was the fact that it had “pre-syndicated” most of the loan to hedge funds.  &lt;br /&gt;This was accomplished in the absence of financial statements or accounting due &lt;br /&gt;diligence, but with validation from the high trading price of the company’s public &lt;br /&gt;securities (which was being set, again, in a financial-statement void).  Okay, so the &lt;br /&gt;lender’s risk was limited.  But how about the funds that bought the loan? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UComplexity Outruns AnalysisU – Wall Street is incredibly inventive.  It’s staffed by &lt;br /&gt;bright people, pursuing massive incentives, trying to out-think their competitors in &lt;br /&gt;order to win assignments to serve companies’ financial needs.  Sometimes this results &lt;br /&gt;in structures that few people understand, fraught with hidden risks.  My latest &lt;br /&gt;nominee is the CPDO, or Constant Proportion Debt Obligation.  CPDOs provide &lt;br /&gt;capital to finance structured entities writing credit insurance on investment grade &lt;br /&gt;debt.  Because this debt entails little credit risk, the returns that can be earned from &lt;br /&gt;writing credit insurance on it are similarly low.  Thus, these entities have to lever up &lt;br /&gt;substantially – typically 15-to-1 – to provide the LIBOR+200 returns promised on the &lt;br /&gt;bottom-tier CPDO.  The rating agencies bestow triple-A ratings on the CPDOs &lt;br /&gt;because (a) the riskiness of investment grade bonds is low and (b) the projected &lt;br /&gt;interest spreads and the net asset values initially are far more than sufficient to satisfy &lt;br /&gt;the covenants.  But because the portfolios are so highly leveraged, these cushions can &lt;br /&gt;evaporate quickly.   &lt;br /&gt;I find two things about CPDOs worthy of particular note.  First, this is the first-&lt;br /&gt;loss equity piece beneath a highly leveraged entity where consequences can be &lt;br /&gt;triggered by breaches of income and market value covenants.  Thus, the equity &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beneath a portfolio of bonds averaging single-A, leveraged up 15-to1, gets a &lt;br /&gt;triple-A rating.  Huh?  Second, as the Financial Times wrote on November 13, &lt;br /&gt;“if there are losses and the CPDO’s net asset value begins to fall from its target, &lt;br /&gt;the leverage is increas&lt;br /&gt;ed to try to earn more at a faster rate.”  In other words, if &lt;br /&gt;you did a little of something and it didn’t work, try to recoup your losses by &lt;br /&gt;doing a lot. &lt;br /&gt; UWhat Due Diligence?U – The other day, Orin Kramer (see “Pigweed”) observed &lt;br /&gt;skeptically that “the most profitable way to be a lender today is to have no &lt;br /&gt;underwriting department.”  In other words, default rates are too low, and the market is &lt;br /&gt;too competitive, for credit analysis to be worth paying for.  In December, Reuters &lt;br /&gt;described a takeover bid whose competitiveness was enhanced by a reduced due &lt;br /&gt;diligence period and a short list of information requirements.  And most interestingly, &lt;br /&gt;one of the major investment banks told us recently that on most syndicated loans, &lt;br /&gt;about 70% of the buyers never visit the data rooms set up to facilitate due diligence. &lt;br /&gt; UPut the Pedal DownU – FT.com pointed out on January 21 that, “One-tenth of the &lt;br /&gt;capital committed [to private equity funds] in 2002 was . . . put to work within one &lt;br /&gt;year.  For funds invested in 2005, the corresponding proportion was almost 30 &lt;br /&gt;percent.”  If the amount raised in 2005 was triple the 2002 level, as I believe was the &lt;br /&gt;case, that means private equity funds deployed capital in 2005 roughly nine times as &lt;br /&gt;fast as they had in 2002. &lt;br /&gt;No one of these is evidence of misfeasance or terminal laxness by itself.  But together &lt;br /&gt;they describe a market where a desire for quantity and speed has taken over from an &lt;br /&gt;insistence on quality and caution.  And with that insistence goes the margin of safety that &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett urges investors to demand. &lt;br /&gt;UThe Amazing Disappearing Covenant &lt;br /&gt;Evaluating and negotiating covenants is an important part of the high yield bond &lt;br /&gt;investor’s job.  The law says a company’s board of directors has a fiduciary duty to its &lt;br /&gt;shareholders, but generally speaking there is no analogous duty to creditors such as banks &lt;br /&gt;and bondholders.  In fact, some companies behave as if they feel a responsibility to &lt;br /&gt;actively take value from creditors and transfer it to the shareholders.  Because companies &lt;br /&gt;can do anything to creditors that isn’t prohibited by law or the bond indenture, covenants &lt;br /&gt;are a key component in creditor safety. &lt;br /&gt;It’s important to bondholders, for example, that the companies to which they lend money &lt;br /&gt;rema&lt;br /&gt;in as little changed as possible.  They want the creditworthiness they lend against to &lt;br /&gt;still be there years down the road, and strong covenants can do a lot to ensure that’s the &lt;br /&gt;case.  Bondholders can’t prevent problems in the economy, the company’s markets, its &lt;br /&gt;products’ competitiveness or its executive suite.  But with good covenants, they can put &lt;br /&gt;limits on leverage, acquisitions, cash distributions or asset transfers, and they can tighten &lt;br /&gt;financial tests and insist on rights that will be triggered if cash flow falls below a &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;specified multiple of the company’s indebtedness or interest obligation.  On the other &lt;br /&gt;hand, just as people who are eager to buy bonds can increase their chances of being able &lt;br /&gt;to do so by accepting less interest&lt;br /&gt;, they also can do so by settling for weaker covenants.   &lt;br /&gt;When credit markets are tight and providers of capital are reticent, money can be hard to &lt;br /&gt;come by.  Companies’ demand for financing can exceed the supply, putting negotiating &lt;br /&gt;power in the hands of the lenders.  Thus lenders can insist on – and obtain – strict &lt;br /&gt;covenants, and bonds issued in such an environment are likely to be relatively safe. &lt;br /&gt;But when usually disciplined bond buyers have to compete against others who aren’t &lt;br /&gt;acting in a disciplined fashion, their ability to insist on covenant protection goes out the &lt;br /&gt;window.  In economics, Gresham’s Law says “bad money drives out good.”  That’s why, &lt;br /&gt;when paper money joined gold as legal tender, gold was put in the strongbox rather than &lt;br /&gt;spent, and only paper m&lt;br /&gt;oney circulated.  The same thing happens in the investing world: &lt;br /&gt;bad investors drive out good.  When undisciplined investors are out there with lots of &lt;br /&gt;money to get rid of, there’s less scope for disciplined investors to insist on strong &lt;br /&gt;covenants.  That’s why the level of covenant protection is a good barometer of the market &lt;br /&gt;climate. &lt;br /&gt;Covenants are the province of a special breed of analysts who are willing to “sweat the &lt;br /&gt;details” and able to make sense of paragraph-long, highly technical sentences.  “A &lt;br /&gt;Review of Covenant Trends in 2006” by Adam B. Cohen is no less challenging reading.  &lt;br /&gt;It reviews last year’s trends in a number of complex indenture provisions, but I’ll limit &lt;br /&gt;myself to quoting its general conclusions: &lt;br /&gt;For years, investors have periodically lamented the declining quality of &lt;br /&gt;high yield bond covenants but the trends have become especially &lt;br /&gt;pronounced amidst a flurry of leveraged buyout (LBO) financings . . . .  a &lt;br /&gt;careful review of covenant packages – particularly in sponsor-backed [i.e., &lt;br /&gt;LBO] offerings – during 2006 reveals a system&lt;br /&gt;atic dismantling of &lt;br /&gt;longstanding covenant protections . . . &lt;br /&gt;And as Reuters reported on February 6, Standard and Poor’s added the weight of &lt;br /&gt;its opinion: &lt;br /&gt;While credit quality is under even greater pressure, the amount of cash on &lt;br /&gt;offer has meant private equity sponsors have been able to dilute lenders’ &lt;br /&gt;rights through weaker covenants and loan documentation, [S&amp;P] said.  &lt;br /&gt;“Loan structures have become so borrow-friendly that private equity &lt;br /&gt;sponsors can write their own term s&lt;br /&gt;heets, using their last term sheet as the &lt;br /&gt;template for their next.” &lt;br /&gt;And, in our view, that template usually serves as the starting point for the next &lt;br /&gt;round of erosion of covenants and terms. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UEffects Short-Term and Long &lt;br /&gt;In the short term, the effect of generous capital market conditions is to make more &lt;br /&gt;money available to more companies for more reasons, at lower rates of interest &lt;br /&gt;and with fewer covenants.  This leads to higher levels of acquisitions, buyouts and &lt;br /&gt;corporate expansion (not to mention rapid recapitalizations of buyout companies &lt;br /&gt;and thus high short-term rates of return).  In the short run, this contributes to a &lt;br /&gt;high level of general financial activity. &lt;br /&gt;Another effect is to forestall financial stringency at weak companies.  When &lt;br /&gt;lenders are strict and covenants are tight, operating problems can lead quickly to &lt;br /&gt;both technical defaults (violations of covenants) and “money defaults” (non-&lt;br /&gt;payment of interest or principal).  But looser conditions can permit default to be &lt;br /&gt;forestalled: if covenants are lax; if borrowers have the option to convert cash-pay &lt;br /&gt;bonds into payment-in-kind bonds (through a recent innovation, “toggle bonds”); &lt;br /&gt;or if they can raise money and thus postpone the day of reckoning. &lt;br /&gt;Eventually, one would think, many of the forestalled defaults will demonstrate &lt;br /&gt;their inevitability, with the com&lt;br /&gt;panies falling from more highly leveraged heights.  &lt;br /&gt;And certainly the capital markets’ willingness to finance less-than-deserving &lt;br /&gt;companies will lead ultimately to a higher level of corporate distress.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;everything else being equal, the bigger the boom – the greater the excesses of &lt;br /&gt;the capital markets in the upward direction – the greater the bust.  Timing &lt;br /&gt;and extent are never predictable, but the occurrence of cycles is the closest thing I &lt;br /&gt;know to inevitable.   And usually, the air goes out of the balloon a lot faster than it &lt;br /&gt;goes in. &lt;br /&gt;*     *     *&lt;br /&gt;Today’s financial market conditions are easily summed up:  There’s a global &lt;br /&gt;glut of liquidity, minimal interest in traditiona&lt;br /&gt;l investments, little apparent &lt;br /&gt;concern about risk, and skimpy prospective returns everywhere.  Thus, as &lt;br /&gt;the price for accessing returns that are potentially adequate (but lower than &lt;br /&gt;those promised in the past), investors are readily accepting significant risk in &lt;br /&gt;the form of heightened leverage, untested derivatives and weak deal &lt;br /&gt;structures.  The current cycle isn’t unusual in its form, only its extent.  There’s &lt;br /&gt;little mystery about the ultimate outcome, in my opinion, but at this point in the &lt;br /&gt;cycle it’s the optimists who look best. &lt;br /&gt;As is often the case, I could have made this a shorter memo by simp&lt;br /&gt;ly invoking &lt;br /&gt;my two favorite quotations, both of which have a place here. &lt;br /&gt;The first is from John Kenneth Galbraith, who passed away last year.  I was fortunate to &lt;br /&gt;be able to spend a few hours with Mr. Galbraith a year and a half earlier and to have the &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;benefit of his wisdom firsthand.  This quote, however, is from his invaluable book, “A &lt;br /&gt;Short History of Financial Euphoria.”  It seems particularly apt under the current &lt;br /&gt;circumstances: &lt;br /&gt;Contributing to . . . euphoria are two further factors little noted in our time &lt;br /&gt;or in past times.  The first is the extreme brevity of the financial memory.  &lt;br /&gt;In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten.  In further &lt;br /&gt;consequence, when the same or closely similar circum&lt;br /&gt;stances occur again, &lt;br /&gt;sometimes in only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, &lt;br /&gt;and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative &lt;br /&gt;discovery in the financial and larger economic world.  There can be few &lt;br /&gt;fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the &lt;br /&gt;world of finance.  Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at &lt;br /&gt;all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the &lt;br /&gt;insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present. &lt;br /&gt;The second is Warren Buffett’s bedrock reminder of the need to adjust our financial &lt;br /&gt;actions based on the investor behavior playing out around us.  Fewer words, but probably &lt;br /&gt;even more useful: &lt;br /&gt;The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the &lt;br /&gt;prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs. &lt;br /&gt;This memo can be summed up simply: there’s a race to the bottom going on, &lt;br /&gt;reflecting a widespread reduction in the level of prudence on the part of investors &lt;br /&gt;and capital providers.  No one can prove at this point that those who participate will &lt;br /&gt;be punished, or that their long-run performance won’t exceed that of the naysayers.  &lt;br /&gt;But that is the usual pattern. &lt;br /&gt;If you refuse to fall into line in carefree markets like today’s, it’s likely that, for a while, &lt;br /&gt;you’ll (a) lag in terms of return and (b) look like an old fogey.  But neither of those is &lt;br /&gt;much of a price to pay if it means keeping your head (and capital) when others eventually &lt;br /&gt;lose theirs.  In my experience, times of laxness have always been followed eventually by &lt;br /&gt;corrections in which penalties are im&lt;br /&gt;posed.  It may not happen this time, but I’ll take that &lt;br /&gt;risk.  In the meantime, Oaktree and its people will continue to apply the standards that &lt;br /&gt;have served us so well over the last twenty years. &lt;br /&gt;February 14, 2007 &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:     Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: It’s All Good &lt;br /&gt;Readers of my memos know that one thing I believe in most strongly – and &lt;br /&gt;harp on most frequently – &lt;br /&gt;is the inevitability of cycles.  They’re something we can depend on absolutely.   &lt;br /&gt;Several of my memos have dealt with cycles, starting from&lt;br /&gt; the very beginning: “First Quarter &lt;br /&gt;Performance” (April 11, 1991), “Will It Be Different This Time?” (November 25, 1996), “You Can’t &lt;br /&gt;Predict.  You Can Prepare.” (November 20, 2001) and “The Happy Medium” (July 21, 2004).  I’ve &lt;br /&gt;said in the past that I consider “You Can’t Predict,” a primer on cycles, to have been one of my best ̧ &lt;br /&gt;and also that it evoked the least response of any memo in this decade.  Thus I’m offering it as a &lt;br /&gt;twofer with this memo; copies are available on request at no additional cost. &lt;br /&gt;I always say that while we can’t know w&lt;br /&gt;here we’re going, we ought to know where we are (in &lt;br /&gt;cyclical terms).  Understanding our environment can help us decide what tactics to employ, how &lt;br /&gt;aggressive to be, and which potential mistakes we should try hardest to avoid.  Being conscious of &lt;br /&gt;cycles can be extremely helpful, even if we can’t see the future. &lt;br /&gt;Thus I’m going to devote this memo&lt;br /&gt; to the cycle that’s been underway for the last few years.  In &lt;br /&gt;terms of amplitude, breadth and potential ramifications, I consider it the strongest, most &lt;br /&gt;heated upswing I’ve witnessed.  A lot of this is because people seem to think everything’s good &lt;br /&gt;and likely to stay that way. &lt;br /&gt;UCycles in the World of Investing  &lt;br /&gt;The basics of cycles are simple.  The economic cycle gives rise to recessions &lt;br /&gt;and recoveries, creating &lt;br /&gt;the business environment.  This produces a business cycle marked by rising and falling sales and &lt;br /&gt;profits.  The credit cycle swings more radically, such that capital market conditions alternate between &lt;br /&gt;irrationally generous and unfairly restrictive.  Likewise, market cycles fluctuate much more than do &lt;br /&gt;the more “fundamental” economic and business cycles, due largely to the volatile cycle in investor &lt;br /&gt;psychology. &lt;br /&gt;In this latter regard, I’ll reprint a few paragraphs from “First Quar&lt;br /&gt;ter Performance,” the 1991 memo &lt;br /&gt;cited above.  I think they capture investors’ pattern of behavior. &lt;br /&gt;The mood swings of the securities markets resemble the moveme&lt;br /&gt;nt of a pendulum.  &lt;br /&gt;Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on &lt;br /&gt;average,” it actually spends very little of its time there.  Instead, it is almost always &lt;br /&gt;swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc.  But whenever the pendulum is &lt;br /&gt;near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back toward the midpoint sooner &lt;br /&gt;or later.  In fact, it is the movement toward the extreme itself that supplies the energy &lt;br /&gt;for the swing back. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment markets make the same pendulum-like swing: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; between euphoria and depression, &lt;br /&gt; between celebrating positive developments and obsessing over negatives,  &lt;br /&gt;and thus &lt;br /&gt; between overpriced and underpriced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This oscillation is one of the most dependable features of the investment world, and &lt;br /&gt;investor psychology seems to spend much more time at the extremes than it does at &lt;br /&gt;the “happy medium.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UPolar Opposites &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My 2004 memo, “The Happy Medium,” took its title from this last phrase and went beyond the three &lt;br /&gt;listed above to discuss additional pairs of opposites between which the investment pendulum &lt;br /&gt;oscillates:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; between greed and fear, &lt;br /&gt; between optimism and pessimism, &lt;br /&gt; between risk tolerance and risk aversion, &lt;br /&gt; between credence and skepticism, &lt;br /&gt; between faith in value in the future and insistence of concrete value in the present, and &lt;br /&gt; between urgency to buy and panic to sell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find particularly interesting the degree to which the polarities listed above are interrelated.  When a &lt;br /&gt;market has been rising strongly for a while, we invariably see all nine of the elements listed first. &lt;br /&gt;And when the market’s been declining, we see all nine of the elements listed second.  Rarely do we &lt;br /&gt;see a blend of the two sets, given that the components in each are causally related, with one giving &lt;br /&gt;rise to the next.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Usually, when either set of polar extremes is in the ascendancy, that fact is readily observable, and &lt;br /&gt;thus the implications for investors should be obvious to objective observers.  But of course, the &lt;br /&gt;swing of the market pendulum to one set of extremes or the other occurs for the simple reason &lt;br /&gt;that the psyches of most market participants are moving in the same direction in a herd-like &lt;br /&gt;fashion.  Few of the people involved actually are objective.  To continue a thread from my last &lt;br /&gt;memo, “Everyone Knows,” expecting widespread clinical observation during a market mania &lt;br /&gt;makes about as much sense as saying “everyone knows the market has gone too far.”  If many &lt;br /&gt;people recognized that it had gone too far, it wouldn’t be there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between the two sets of cyclical extremes, I have no doubt that the environment of the last few &lt;br /&gt;years has been marked by the elements listed first above, not second: euphoria, greed, &lt;br /&gt;optimism, risk tolerance and credence; not depression, fear, pessimism, risk aversion and &lt;br /&gt;skepticism.  Certainly it’s been the recent consensus of investors that, “It’s all good.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UUnusual Breadth &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the past we’ve seen bull markets in equities, commodities and real estate.  And we’ve seen bull &lt;br /&gt;markets in the U.S., Japan and the emerging markets.  But this time around, we’ve been seeing a &lt;br /&gt;near-global bull market, where the participating sectors vastly outnumber those left out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In his April letter to investors, entitled “The First Truly Global Bubble,” Jeremy Grantham summed &lt;br /&gt;up the worldwide nature of the good times.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never before have &lt;br /&gt;UallU emerging countries outperformed the U.S. in GDP growth over &lt;br /&gt;a 12-month period until now, and this when the U.S. has been doing well.  Not a &lt;br /&gt;single country anywhere – emerging or developed – out of the 42 listed by The &lt;br /&gt;Economist grew its GDP by less than Switzerland’s 2.2%!  Amazingly uniform &lt;br /&gt;strength, and yet another sign of how globalized and correlated fundamentals have &lt;br /&gt;become, as well as the financial markets that reflect them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bubbles, of course, are based on human behavior, and the mechanism is surprisingly &lt;br /&gt;simple: perfect conditions create very strong “animal spirits,” reflected statistically in &lt;br /&gt;a low risk premium.  Widely available cheap credit offers investors the opportunity to &lt;br /&gt;act on their optimism.  Sustained strong fundamentals and sustained easy credit go &lt;br /&gt;one better; they allow for continued reinforcement: the more leverage you take, the &lt;br /&gt;better you do; the better you do, the more leverage you take. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A critical part of the bubble is the reinforcement you get for your optimistic view &lt;br /&gt;from those around you.  And of course, as often mentioned, this is helped along by &lt;br /&gt;the finance industry, broadly defined, that makes more money when optimism and &lt;br /&gt;activity are high. . . .  To say the least, there has never ever been anything like the &lt;br /&gt;uniformity of this reinforcement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The March issue of Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Report described the pervasiveness of the &lt;br /&gt;positive effect on markets.  He listed four “bubbles of epic proportions” that he has witnessed: &lt;br /&gt;metals, mining and energy in the 1970s; Japanese equities and real estate and Taiwanese equities in &lt;br /&gt;the late 1980s; emerging markets in the 1990s; and TMT at the end of the 1990s.  In contrast to the &lt;br /&gt;present experience, he pointed out,  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;. . . all had one common feature: they were concentrated in just one or very few &lt;br /&gt;sectors of the economic or investment universe and were accompanied by a poor &lt;br /&gt;performance in some other asset classes. . . .  Currently, looking at the five most &lt;br /&gt;important asset classes – real estate, equities, bonds, commodities, and art (including &lt;br /&gt;collectibles) – I am not aware of any asset class that has declined in value since 2002!  &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly some assets have performed better than others, but in general every sort &lt;br /&gt;of asset has risen in price, and this is true everywhere in the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s interesting not only to see just about everything rise at the same time, but also to see people act as &lt;br /&gt;if this is likely to continue for a prolonged period.  Usually that just doesn’t happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UIt’s Different This Time  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My memos are full of quotations, adages and old saws.  I’m attached to a few and tend to use them &lt;br /&gt;over and over.  Why reinvent the wheel, especially if the old one can’t be improved upon?  Hopefully &lt;br /&gt;the things I borrow contain enough wisdom to make them worth repeating.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Equally worth repeating are the statements I cite as investor mistakes.  They, too, are highly &lt;br /&gt;instructive . . . in the sense that they’re heard often and must be recognized for how potentially toxic &lt;br /&gt;they are.  None is as dangerous as “it’s different this time.”  Those four little words are always &lt;br /&gt;heard when the market swings to dangerously high levels.  Like so many of the polar opposites &lt;br /&gt;enumerated above, it’s not just the sign of an absurd condition.  It’s a prerequisite.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I first came across the phrase in what for me was a seminal article, “Why This Market Cycle Isn’t &lt;br /&gt;Any Different,” by Anise C. Wallace (New York Times, October 11, 1987).  The stock market’s &lt;br /&gt;rapid ascent at the time was being attributed to (or excused by), among other things, (1) the outlook &lt;br /&gt;for continued economic growth, given that the economy had learned how to correct itself painlessly, &lt;br /&gt;(2) the likelihood of continued buying of U.S. stocks by foreign investors piling up dollars with no &lt;br /&gt;better place to go, and (3) the fact that stocks weren’t overvalued compared to other assets, which &lt;br /&gt;had also appreciated.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Ms. Wallace countered as follows:  “No matter what brokers or money managers say, bull &lt;br /&gt;markets do not last forever.  In general, investment professionals say, cycles and markets differ only &lt;br /&gt;by degree.”  And of course, in the next eight days the Dow fell 30%.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t just 1987.  People also came to believe the business cycle had been tamed in 1928 and in &lt;br /&gt;the late 1990s.  And wouldn’t you know, I’m hearing it again today: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Fed’s skillfully walking the tightrope between stimulus and restrictiveness.  (A few years &lt;br /&gt;ago people felt Greenspan was indispensable; now there’s suddenly faith in Bernanke.) &lt;br /&gt; A service economy is less volatile than a manufacturing-based economy. &lt;br /&gt; As the Chinese and Indians get rich, their purchases from us will buoy our economy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The truth is, we couldn’t have great cyclical extremes if people didn’t occasionally fall for a &lt;br /&gt;justification that’s never held true before.  How else might investors rationalize holding or &lt;br /&gt;buying despite highly elevated valuation parameters, low prospective returns and just-plain-&lt;br /&gt;wacky security structures?  I still believe what I wrote in “The Happy Medium”:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cycles are inevitable.  Every once in a while, an up- or down-leg goes on for a long &lt;br /&gt;time and/or to a great extreme and people start to say “this time it’s different.”  They &lt;br /&gt;cite the changes in geopolitics, institutions, technology or behavior that have rendered &lt;br /&gt;the “old rules” obsolete.  They make investment decisions that extrapolate the recent &lt;br /&gt;trend.  And then it turns out that the old rules do still apply, and the cycle resumes.  In &lt;br /&gt;the end, trees don’t grow to the sky, and few things go to zero.  Rather, most &lt;br /&gt;phenomena turn out to be cyclical. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m hearing again – as often in the past – that we’re in a Goldilocks economy.  It’s not so hot that &lt;br /&gt;there’s risk of inflation accelerating, which would require restrictive measures on the part of the Fed.   &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so cold that business will slow, with a depressing effect on profits.  No, it’s just right.  Of course, &lt;br /&gt;this condition has never held for long in the past. &lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year, Kenneth Lewis, chairman of Bank of America, summed it up candidly and simply: &lt;br /&gt;“We are close to a time when we’ll look back and say we did some stupid things . . .  We need a little &lt;br /&gt;more sanity in a period in which everyone feels invincible and thinks this is different.” &lt;br /&gt;And while I’m on the subject, I want to offer an important observation.  No matter how &lt;br /&gt;favorable and steady fundamentals may be, the markets will always be subject to substantial &lt;br /&gt;cyclical fluctuation.   The reason is simple: even ideal conditions can become overrated and U&lt;br /&gt;therefore overpriced.  And having reached too-high levels, prices will correct, bringing capital U&lt;br /&gt;losses despite the idealness of the environment (see tech stocks in 2000).  So don’t fall into the &lt;br /&gt;trap of thinking that good fundamentals = positive market outlook (and especially not forever).  &lt;br /&gt;As I said in “Everyone &lt;br /&gt;Knows,” profit potential is all a matter of the relationship between &lt;br /&gt;intrinsic value and price.  There is no level of fundamentals that can’t become overpriced. &lt;br /&gt;Willing Suspension of Disbelief &lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;One of the key requisites for enjoying a trip to the movies is a willingness to suspend disbelief.  If &lt;br /&gt;they    wanted to, moviegoers invariably could find plot glitches, technological impossibilities or &lt;br /&gt;historical inaccuracies.  But they tend to overlook them in the interest of having a good time. &lt;br /&gt;Similarly, investors’ recurring acceptance that it’s different this time – or that cycles are no &lt;br /&gt;more – is exemplary of a willing suspension of disbelief that springs from glee over how    well &lt;br /&gt;things are going (on the part of people who’re in the market) or rationalization of the reasons &lt;br /&gt;to throw off caution and get on board (from those who’ve been watching from the sidelines as &lt;br /&gt;prices moved higher and others made money). &lt;br /&gt;The fact is,&lt;br /&gt; the higher asset prices go, the more people think assets are worth, and the more eager &lt;br /&gt;they become to buy them.  A rip-roaring rally fuels buying appetites rather than make people think &lt;br /&gt;the appreciation may have moved prices to precarious levels.  In the same way, price collapses cause &lt;br /&gt;people to worry rather than start combing the market for bargains. &lt;br /&gt;In this way, the bullish swing of the investment cycle tends to cause skepticism and risk &lt;br /&gt;tolerance to evaporate.  Faith, credence and open-mindedness all tend to move up – at just the &lt;br /&gt;time that skepticism, discrimination and circu&lt;br /&gt;mspection become the qualities that are most &lt;br /&gt;needed. &lt;br /&gt;Financial Innovation  &lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;Another element that I notice tends to rise and fall with the cycles is the level of financial &lt;br /&gt;innovation.  Again, this is a cycle that’s easily understood. &lt;br /&gt;W&lt;br /&gt;all Street exists to develop and sell new products, no less so than toothpaste manufacturers &lt;br /&gt;and movie studios.  So   why is it that some periods are rife with innovation and other periods &lt;br /&gt;totally lacking?  It’s because it’s only in bullish times that investors accept financial inventions.  &lt;br /&gt;When the market’s in an up-swing, people tend to say, “Sure, I’ll give it a chance” or “Good, I’ve &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;been looking for new ways to make money.”  But when the market has been moving down and &lt;br /&gt;people are tallying their losses, they tend to be much less open to new ideas.  In the financial world, &lt;br /&gt;the mother of invention isn’t necessity, its salability. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the roaring 1960s we saw Nifty-Fifty investing, dual shares from mutual funds and discounted &lt;br /&gt;shares issued through unregistered private placements without any mechanism for subsequent &lt;br /&gt;liquidity.  In the ’80s we saw portfolio insurance – a surefire way to enjoy the appreciation potential &lt;br /&gt;that comes with large commitments to equities, but with much less risk.  And in the ’90s, no one &lt;br /&gt;could think of a reason why every dot-com, e-tailer, media aggregation and venture capital fund &lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t be successful.  Of course, all of these things failed to function as promised and either &lt;br /&gt;disappeared forever or experienced severe corrections.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And what have we seen in the last few years?  CDOs, CLOs, CPDOs, SPACs and securitizations of &lt;br /&gt;every type.  In the current environment – marked by decent returns; disinterest in conventional, safe &lt;br /&gt;assets; and openness to risky investments – few people seem to dwell on the reasons why something &lt;br /&gt;new might not work.  No one asks why, if a $2 billion fund was successful, a $20 billion fund &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t be as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Derivatives deserve particular attention in this regard.  On July 8 The Wall Street Journal noted that, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over the last six years, global futures trading on exchanges has grown nearly 30% a &lt;br /&gt;year. The total derivatives market is valued at about $500 trillion, four times the value &lt;br /&gt;of all publicly traded stock and bonds. . . .  The four biggest futures exchanges have &lt;br /&gt;launched more than 300 new derivatives products in just the last few years . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Particularly intriguing, it seems the value of outstanding credit default swaps – insurance against &lt;br /&gt;defaults among corporate debt instruments – exceeds the value of the instruments insured.  How will &lt;br /&gt;this work if a wave of defaults occurs?  How well are the provisions of these insurance contracts &lt;br /&gt;documented?  How readily will the writers of the insurance pay up?  What will be the effect if &lt;br /&gt;conditions are chaotic?  No one knows the answers to these questions.  Inventions originate in up &lt;br /&gt;markets, but they’re tested in down markets.  Rarely do they work entirely as hoped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In down markets, people see potential risks that can’t be argued away.  But in markets like this &lt;br /&gt;one, they see opportunities they must seize to avoid being left behind.  Thus, like the other &lt;br /&gt;things I’m discussing, a high level of financial innovation is symptomatic of a market that’s &lt;br /&gt;been rising for a good while and may be behaving in an overconfident manner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhat, Me Worry? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two recent innovations deserve particular attention here: structured entities and what the British call &lt;br /&gt;“selling onward.”  Both embody an impractical expectation: that financial engineering can &lt;br /&gt;eliminate risk.  Combined, they’re particularly dangerous.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In creating structured entities such as CDOs, managers bring together investors with different &lt;br /&gt;risk/return appetites.  To satisfy those varying appetites, the investors are sold claims with different &lt;br /&gt;priorities with regard to the entity’s portfolio and cashflows, and with projected returns that are &lt;br /&gt;proportional.  The managers use the investors’ capital to assemble a portfolio of assets.  And each &lt;br /&gt;investor receives a security with risk and return tailored to its needs. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should work . . . in theory.  My biggest knocks on structuring are these:  First, many of the people &lt;br /&gt;who develop the structured entities and rate their securities know more about probabilities than they &lt;br /&gt;do about the specific assets in the portfolio, something that’s particularly dangerous when portfolios &lt;br /&gt;are highly leveraged.  And second, there seems to be a belief that this process – at Oaktree we call it &lt;br /&gt;“slicing and dicing” – can reduce the overall risk in the system.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If risk is reduced, I’d like to know where the eliminated part goes.  If ten people each hold a share of &lt;br /&gt;ten highly correlated risky assets, I don’t think the overall system is much less risky than if each of &lt;br /&gt;the ten people held one entire risky asset.  At the extreme, however, it may be true that risk sharing &lt;br /&gt;reduces the likelihood that a spate of failures will precipitate a generalized credit crunch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Selling onward is the process through which the originating of assets and the owning of assets are &lt;br /&gt;separated.  In the old days, banks made loans and mostly held on to them, syndicating a bit to build &lt;br /&gt;relationships and limit risk.  Nowadays, banks originate loans largely to generate loan and &lt;br /&gt;syndication fees, and actually living with the loans is much less prevalent.  After they’re originated, &lt;br /&gt;assets such as corporate loans, mortgages, auto paper and credit card receivables are often packaged &lt;br /&gt;and sold, sometimes in the form of securities.  There’s a belief that this process, too, makes the world &lt;br /&gt;less risky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I fail to see net benefits here as well.  Instead, I think this process introduces great moral hazard.  &lt;br /&gt;When the people making loans aren’t going to remain dependent on the borrowers they give money &lt;br /&gt;to, they have little incentive to actively police risk.  Thus I have grave doubts about a lot of the credit &lt;br /&gt;decisions being made.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For an extreme example, take a look at the subprime mortgage brokers.  Were they motivated to &lt;br /&gt;make prudent credit decisions?  No; they were motivated to create a lot of paper.  There’s &lt;br /&gt;something wrong when it’s in someone’s best interests to lend money to unqualified borrowers, &lt;br /&gt;but this was the case in subprime mortgages.  Obviously this occurred because mortgage brokers &lt;br /&gt;weren’t risking their own money.  With selling onward so prevalent, an originator just had to hope &lt;br /&gt;the borrower would make the first few payments, so that delinquencies wouldn’t surface before the &lt;br /&gt;originator’s repurchase obligation expired and the loans became the buyer’s problem.  How could &lt;br /&gt;buyers have been silly enough to purchase loans made by brokers operating under this set of &lt;br /&gt;incentives? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, let’s combine structuring and selling onward.  Here’s how I see it working: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A mortgage broker makes a bunch of loans without knowing much about creditworthiness (think &lt;br /&gt;about so-called “liar loans”) or caring much about creditworthiness (because he intends to sell &lt;br /&gt;them momentarily). &lt;br /&gt; An investment banker buys a few hundred of these loans, also without knowing much about them &lt;br /&gt;(because of their sheer numbers), in order to package them into residential mortgage-backed &lt;br /&gt;securities (RMBS) and sell them onward.  &lt;br /&gt; An investment manager buys a few dozen RMBS, about which he doesn’t know much (also the &lt;br /&gt;numbers) or care much (because the fees and potential profits incentivize him to put a lot of &lt;br /&gt;money to work fast).  They become part of the portfolio of a CDO, against which debt is issued. &lt;br /&gt; A rating agency analyst assigns ratings to the CDO debt, about which he can’t know much (lack &lt;br /&gt;of specialized expertise; vast number of underlying assets; structural complexity and the newness &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A hedge fund manager buys CDO debt about which he doesn’t know m&lt;br /&gt;uch (with thousands of &lt;br /&gt;underlying mortgages having been sliced and diced) or worry much (given the high debt ratings). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Concoctions like this are tolerated only in heady times. Clearly the results can be incendiary.  We’re &lt;br /&gt;waiting to see the final outcome – and perhaps to pick among the ashes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One last thought:  Let’s say slicing, dicing and selling onward do have the potential to reduce the &lt;br /&gt;overall level of risk in the system, all other things being equal.  Even if that were true, the other &lt;br /&gt;things wouldn’t remain equal; market participants would adjust their behavior to the new &lt;br /&gt;reality and in so doing return risk to its old level.  On May 23, the Financial Times said this about &lt;br /&gt;trying to reduce risk by selling onward and by obtaining credit insurance via derivatives: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This makes banks less vulnerable to individual defaults. But it could also be making &lt;br /&gt;them feel so comfortable about lending risks that they are making more risky &lt;br /&gt;loans.  Outside investors such as hedge funds are gobbling them up, either because &lt;br /&gt;they also think they are protected with credit derivatives or because they are &lt;br /&gt;desperate to find somewhere to place their cash.  This has triggered a collapse in the &lt;br /&gt;standards used to conduct and fund deals.  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again, no matter how good fundamentals may be, humans exercising their greed and propensity to &lt;br /&gt;err have the ability to screw things up.  Perhaps Myron Scholes put it most succinctly (The Wall &lt;br /&gt;Street Journal, March 6): “My belief is that because the system is now more stable, we’ll make &lt;br /&gt;it less stable through more leverage, more risk taking.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe L Word &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the most glaring innovation this time around has taken place in the area of leverage.  It’s not &lt;br /&gt;that leverage hasn’t been available and been used before:  In the late 1980s, companies like RJR were &lt;br /&gt;the subject of leveraged buyouts in which 95% of the purchase price was borrowed.  Nowadays, debt &lt;br /&gt;rarely constitutes much more than 80% of buyout capital structures, but the terms of the debt and the &lt;br /&gt;ease of obtaining it are startlingly accommodating.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unlike the historic norm, it’s routine today to issue CCC-rated bonds.  It’s easy to borrow money for &lt;br /&gt;the express purpose of distributing cash to equity holders, magnifying the company’s leverage.  It’s &lt;br /&gt;so easy to issue bonds with little or no creditor protection in the indenture that a label has been &lt;br /&gt;coined for them: “covenant-lite.”  And it’s possible to issue bonds whose interest payments can be &lt;br /&gt;paid in more bonds at the option of the borrower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first requirement for an elevated opportunity in distressed debt is the unwise extension of &lt;br /&gt;credit, which I define as the making of loans which borrowers will be unable to service if things &lt;br /&gt;get a little worse.  This happens when lenders fail to require a sufficient margin of safety.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here the interrelatedness of cycles is quite evident.  Good economic times bring rising profits.  &lt;br /&gt;Rising profits cause the default rate to subside.  And the low default experience erases lenders’ &lt;br /&gt;reticence.  Among other things, they become willing to lend money so that troubled companies can &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stay afloat and hopefully outgrow their problems.  Today that’s called “rescue finance”; in less rosy &lt;br /&gt;times it might be called “throwing good money after bad.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The default rate in the high yield bond universe is at a 25-year low on a rolling-twelve-month &lt;br /&gt;basis.  Under such circumstances, how could the average supplier of capital be expected to &lt;br /&gt;maintain a high level of risk aversion and prudence, especially when doing so means ceding all &lt;br /&gt;the loan making to others?  It’s not for nothing that they say “The worst of loans are made in &lt;br /&gt;the best of times.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Downside of Leverage  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If lenders are acting in an imprudent fashion, what’s the effect on the borrowing companies?  If loans &lt;br /&gt;are available too readily, is it right or wrong to borrow?  These are among the most interesting &lt;br /&gt;questions of the day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lots of good things have been said about leverage.  In the late 1980s, when venerable American &lt;br /&gt;companies were being bought in leveraged buyouts structured with debt/equity ratios of 25-to-one, &lt;br /&gt;we were told that an underleveraged balance sheet is indicative of a sub-optimal capital structure and &lt;br /&gt;excessive use of high-cost equity, and that significant leverage sharpens management’s focus on cash &lt;br /&gt;flow and leads to better expense control.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing omitted was the reminder that equity – which doesn’t require the periodic payment of &lt;br /&gt;interest or the repayment of principal at maturity – represents a company’s margin of safety.  It’s the &lt;br /&gt;capital layer that absorbs the first blow in tough times without occasioning an event of default.  &lt;br /&gt;While leverage may magnify gains in good times, it’s a healthy layer of equity that gets &lt;br /&gt;companies through the bad times.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s inescapable that, all other things equal, greater leverage increases a company’s likelihood &lt;br /&gt;of experiencing financial distress.  Thus, with lenders enjoying a carefree recent experience and &lt;br /&gt;consequently financing some unwise deals – and with borrowers eager for the enhanced upside &lt;br /&gt;potential that comes with leverage – it seems clear that we’ll see rising rates of default and &lt;br /&gt;bankruptcy a few years down the pike.  This is especially true if, as has often been the case &lt;br /&gt;recently, debt is incurred not just to leverage the company’s equity, but to finance payouts to equity &lt;br /&gt;holders that reduce or eliminate the equity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So then, are private equity funds – raising much more equity capital than ever, and doing the biggest &lt;br /&gt;deals in history at a rapid-fire pace, at rising transaction prices and rising leverage ratios – doing a &lt;br /&gt;smart thing or making a mistake?  It all depends on how you look at things.  The funds seem to be &lt;br /&gt;looking in terms of optionality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UKetchup, Easy Money and Optionality  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a picky eater when I was a kid, but I loved ketchup, and my pickiness could be overcome with &lt;br /&gt;ketchup.  I would eat hamburgers, frankfurters, veal cutlets, filet of sole and frozen fish sticks, but as &lt;br /&gt;far as I was concerned, they were all just vehicles for ketchup.  The ketchup of today is easy &lt;br /&gt;borrowing, and private equity managers are entering into a large number of transactions to access it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate what I consider to be the thought process:  If you were offered the chance to buy &lt;br /&gt;companies with 100% debt financing and no money of your own, how many would you buy?  The &lt;br /&gt;smart answer is, “All of them.”  Not just the well-run ones?  Or the growing ones?  Or the profitable &lt;br /&gt;ones?  No; all of them.  Some would produce positive cash flow and/or appreciation, which you’d &lt;br /&gt;welcome.  The others would be unsuccessful, but with none of your own money invested, you’d just &lt;br /&gt;walk away.  That’s optionality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Optionality is a new-age finance term for the ability to cheaply obtain a call on asset &lt;br /&gt;appreciation, creating the possibility of profits out of proportion to potential losses.  That’s the &lt;br /&gt;way it is in venture capital: all you can lose is your investment, but you can multiply it hundreds of &lt;br /&gt;times simply by finding the next Google.  Even though venture capital investing produces only &lt;br /&gt;occasional success, it’s justified by the occasional outsized payoff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think that’s the deal today in mega-private equity.  In their highly successful first decade of 1975-&lt;br /&gt;85, LBO funds invested in small, underpriced industrial concerns or orphaned corporate spinoffs.  &lt;br /&gt;They paid low prices for stable companies, financed their purchases with moderate amounts of debt, &lt;br /&gt;and put a lot of energy into improving the companies’ operations.  Both their batting averages and &lt;br /&gt;their overall rates of return were attractive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I’m not sure that’s the model today.  Few companies are languishing on the bargain counter, and &lt;br /&gt;everyone knows that if buyout funds bid for a company, the shareholders had better take a good look &lt;br /&gt;at what they’re giving up.  Likewise, buyout funds are buying well into a period of economic &lt;br /&gt;expansion, and the scope for improvement in operations may be limited.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, the model today seems different: pay premiums to open-market prices for prominent, multi-&lt;br /&gt;billion dollar companies, sometimes after the boards, shareholders or other bidders have forced prices &lt;br /&gt;higher.  Borrow large sums to finance the deals.  Generate whatever fundamental improvement you &lt;br /&gt;can.  Hope the market will provide a highly leveraged payoff.  And, given the enormity of the scale, &lt;br /&gt;get rich off management fees, ancillary fees and the profits from the ones that work.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In other words, it seems that, relative to the past, the thought process in mega-private equity is based &lt;br /&gt;on the combination of (1) ultra-cheap financing, (2) high fees, (3) quick withdrawal of equity capital &lt;br /&gt;and (4) a lower batting average but big payouts on the winners.  The optionality is certainly on the &lt;br /&gt;GPs’ side.  Let’s hope it works for the LPs as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UIf the Lender’s a Sap, Is the Borrower a Genius? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of experience looking at leveraged transactions from the standpoint of the lender, but less &lt;br /&gt;experience as a borrower.  Thus I found it novel – even surprising – to read a January memo on this &lt;br /&gt;subject from Carlyle founder William Conway to his colleagues, with thoughts echoing mine: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As you all know (I hope), the fabulous profits that we have been able to generate for &lt;br /&gt;our limited partners are not solely a function of our investment genius, but have &lt;br /&gt;resulted in large part from a great market and the availability of enormous amounts of &lt;br /&gt;cheap debt.  This cheap debt has been available for almost all maturities, most &lt;br /&gt;industries, infrastructure, real estate, and at all levels of the capital structure.  Frankly, &lt;br /&gt;there is so much liquidity in the world financial system, that lenders (even “our” &lt;br /&gt;lenders) are making very risky credit decisions. . . . &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that this liquidity environment cannot go on forever.  I know that the longer it &lt;br /&gt;lasts the more money our investors (and we) will make.  I know that the longer it &lt;br /&gt;lasts, the greater the pressures will be on all of us to take advantage of this liquidity.  &lt;br /&gt;And I know that the longer it lasts, the worse it will be when it ends.  And of course &lt;br /&gt;when it ends the buying opportunity will be a once in a lifetime chance.  But, I do not &lt;br /&gt;know when it will end. . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Last year, I asked you to be humble, ethical and optimistic.  This year I am asking &lt;br /&gt;you to be careful as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1990-91, our distressed debt funds made a fortune buying the obligations of companies that had &lt;br /&gt;been loaded up with too much debt in LBOs in the late ’80s.  Chastened by that experience, lenders &lt;br /&gt;in the ’90s didn’t provide enough leverage to make buyout companies much of a factor in the debt &lt;br /&gt;collapse of 2002.  But with the memory of having 1990-91 faded, leverage became freely available in &lt;br /&gt;the last few years, and thus we have little doubt we’ll be buying a great deal of distressed LBO debt &lt;br /&gt;the next time around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When all the above is taken together, it seems likely that a few years out, we’ll see a landscape &lt;br /&gt;littered with companies that were crippled with excessive debt loads and lenders who weren’t repaid.  &lt;br /&gt;What happens to private equity funds and their investors will depend on the outcome of a game of &lt;br /&gt;hot potato: will they get their capital – and their gains – out of the over-leveraged companies before &lt;br /&gt;they go sour?  We’ll see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UBut Don’t the Borrowers Have a Free Pass? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Much is being made of the possibility that today’s debt is default-proof.  “Toggle bonds” give &lt;br /&gt;borrowers the option of paying interest in the form of more bonds for a while.  And covenant-lite &lt;br /&gt;indentures mean the likelihood of an interim technical default has been reduced.  Do these &lt;br /&gt;developments reduce the overall risk? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This, too, goes back to the concept of optionality.  The value of an option is greater the longer it has &lt;br /&gt;to run, and options that can’t be extinguished early are worth more than those that can. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Think of someone who issues ten-year bonds to raise the money with which to buy a company.  On &lt;br /&gt;the surface, it seems he has ten years for his purchase to work out profitably, at the end of which &lt;br /&gt;period he has to repay his lenders.  In other words, he has a ten-year option on the company’s &lt;br /&gt;appreciation potential.  But what if the company gets in a bind in the early years and misses an &lt;br /&gt;interest payment?  Or if an economic slowdown causes a technical breach of a covenant?  In past &lt;br /&gt;downturns, these things have forced borrowers to pay lenders for extensions or forbearance, and they &lt;br /&gt;have led to defaults.  Those things may be somewhat less likely nowadays. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is true that payment-in-kind and covenant-lite loans reduce the likelihood of interim defaults.  But &lt;br /&gt;does that mean the credit landscape is risk-free and lenders can breathe easy?  Sooner or later, debt &lt;br /&gt;has to be repaid or refinanced, and the credit market may not be accommodating at that moment; this &lt;br /&gt;is especially true if the company’s fortunes have deteriorated.  Not enough of a company’s debt may &lt;br /&gt;be default-proof to make it invulnerable.  The price of the debt may decline with the fundamentals, &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even if default isn’t an immediate threat.  And the free pass in the interim may just delay – but also &lt;br /&gt;worsen – the eventual outcome.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Under a traditional structure, a company might default in the third year of a bond’s life, by which &lt;br /&gt;time 20% of its value may have evaporated.  But with these new wrinkles, it might not happen until &lt;br /&gt;year five . . . when 60% of the value is gone.  Yes, lenders are giving borrowers more rope.  But &lt;br /&gt;will it prove to be a lifeline for the company or a hangman’s noose?  A lot will depend on how &lt;br /&gt;things go while the postponed default is in abeyance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is yet another area where up-cycle faith that risk has been reduced can convince people to add &lt;br /&gt;back the risk.  As The Wall Street Journal said of standby revolvers on May 11, “Thanks to debt &lt;br /&gt;arrangements like this, some private-equity buyers say they are doing deals they would otherwise not &lt;br /&gt;do.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhat Could Cause This Upward Cycle to Falter? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I insist that the good times can’t roll on forever, I’m often asked what might make them stop.  I &lt;br /&gt;don’t have any inside information on this subject, but I can enumerate the possibilities: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. economic slowdown, &lt;br /&gt;2. reduced willingness to lend or insistence on higher interest rates, perhaps due to increased &lt;br /&gt;worry about credit risk, &lt;br /&gt;3. systemic problems like a crisis in derivatives or a cluster of hedge fund meltdowns, &lt;br /&gt;4. exogenous factors such as $100 oil, a dollar crisis, terrorist acts, and &lt;br /&gt;5. the things I haven’t thought of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, I want to point out that these things are not unrelated.  A reduction in lenders’ willingness to &lt;br /&gt;lend may stem from an economic slowdown.  An economic slowdown could be brought on by an &lt;br /&gt;exogenous event.  It’s when there’s a confluence of these things that the debt market gets into real &lt;br /&gt;trouble, as was the case in 1990 and 2002. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, these things are often unpredictable.  I like to remind people that the best buying opportunity &lt;br /&gt;we ever had in distressed debt arose in the summer of 2002, when recession, credit crunch, 9/11, &lt;br /&gt;Afghanistan, telecom meltdown and the scandals at Enron et al. occurred all at once.  Few if any of &lt;br /&gt;these were predictable twelve months earlier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And third, the one we should worry about most is number five.  Investors can cope with the things &lt;br /&gt;they can anticipate, analyze and discount.  They have more trouble with the rest.  I love hearing &lt;br /&gt;people from the “I know” school say, “I’m not anticipating any surprises.”  Those are the &lt;br /&gt;developments that can knock a market into a cocked hat.  As Martin Wolf wrote in the Financial &lt;br /&gt;Times on May 2, “The most obvious reason for taking today’s euphoria with a barrel of salt is that &lt;br /&gt;nobody ever expects shocks.  That is what makes them shocks.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Where do we stand in the cycle?  In my opinion, there’s little mystery.  I see low levels of &lt;br /&gt;skepticism, fear and risk aversion.  Most people are willing to undertake risky investments, often &lt;br /&gt;because the promised returns from traditional, safe investments seem so meager.  This is true even &lt;br /&gt;though the lack of interest in safe investments and the acceptance of risky investments have rendered &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the slope of the risk/return line quite flat.  Risk premiums are generally the skimpiest I’ve ever seen, &lt;br /&gt;but few people are responding by refusing to accept incremental risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peter Bernstein put it this way in the February 15 issue of Economics and Portfolio Strategy:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hear over and over that we live in an era of low expected returns.  The rational &lt;br /&gt;response to low expected returns is to withdraw and wait until expected returns are &lt;br /&gt;higher.  That response to low expected returns appears to have gone out of fashion.  &lt;br /&gt;Today’s response is to seek higher returns from higher risks in a low-risk &lt;br /&gt;environment – or, worse, to underestimate the risks taken.  [Of course, I am less &lt;br /&gt;certain than Peter that we are in a low-risk environment.] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Markets have tended recently to move up on positive developments and to recover easily from &lt;br /&gt;negatives.  I see few assets that people are eager to get rid of, and few forced sellers; instead, most &lt;br /&gt;assets are strongly bid for.  As a result, I’m not aware of any broad markets that I would describe as &lt;br /&gt;under-priced or uncrowded.  I will say, however, that some of the excess confidence that usually &lt;br /&gt;accompanies booms may be missing.  Some of the people making risky investments today seem to be &lt;br /&gt;doing so with their fingers crossed.  And even though they’re optimistic enough to make these &lt;br /&gt;prosperity-oriented investments, they’re also wary enough to want to hedge their bets by &lt;br /&gt;participating in distressed debt as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is what it is.  We’ve been living in optimistic times.  The cycle has been swinging strongly &lt;br /&gt;upward.  Prices are elevated and risk premiums are slender.  Trust has replaced skepticism, &lt;br /&gt;and eagerness has replaced reticence.  Do you agree or disagree?  That’s the key question.  &lt;br /&gt;Answer it first, and the implications for investing become clear.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the first quarter of this year, significant delinquencies occurred in subprime mortgages.  Those &lt;br /&gt;directly involved lost a lot of money, and onlookers worried about contagion to other parts of the &lt;br /&gt;economy and other markets.  In the second quarter, the impact reached CDOs that had invested in &lt;br /&gt;subprime mortgage portfolios and hedge funds that had bought CDO debt, including two Bear &lt;br /&gt;Stearns funds.  Those who had to liquidate assets were forced – as usual – to sell what they could &lt;br /&gt;sell, not what they wanted to sell, and not just the offending subprime-linked assets.  We began to &lt;br /&gt;read about ratings downgrades, margin calls and fire-sales, the usual fuel for capital market &lt;br /&gt;meltdowns.  And in the last few weeks we’ve begun to see investor reticence on the rise, with new &lt;br /&gt;low-grade debt issues repriced, postponed or pulled, leaving bridge loans un-refinanced. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is in this way that awareness of the inevitability of cycles is reawakened, and it is for reasons &lt;br /&gt;like these that the pendulum starts to swing back from one extreme toward the center of its arc &lt;br /&gt;. . . and then the other extreme.  We never know whether a little jiggle is the start of the swing &lt;br /&gt;back and, if so, how far it will go.  But we always should be aware that reversion will occur. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last 4½ years have been carefree, halcyon times for investors.  That doesn’t mean it’ll stay that &lt;br /&gt;way.  I’ll give Warren Buffett the last word, as I often do:  “It’s only when the tide goes out that you &lt;br /&gt;find out who’s been swimming naked.”  Pollyannas take note: the tide cannot come in forever.  &lt;br /&gt;Time, tide and cycles wait for no man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July 16, 2007 &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:     Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: It’s All Good . . . Really? &lt;br /&gt;As I worked on “It’s All Good” during my vacation in late June – and even when I issued &lt;br /&gt;it two weeks ago – I had no reason to believe that the universally upward cycle about &lt;br /&gt;which I was writing could be curtailed before the end of July.  But the good times &lt;br /&gt;certainly have stopped rolling in many areas, at least for now.  I think it’s extremely &lt;br /&gt;important to study the way this has happened, as it provides a highly instructive object &lt;br /&gt;lesson. &lt;br /&gt;It’s folly to think we know in advance just what it is that will cause th&lt;br /&gt;e market &lt;br /&gt;pendulum to stop swinging in one direction and start in the other, but it’s even &lt;br /&gt;greater folly to think that nothing of that nature will happen.  That’s my twist on one &lt;br /&gt;of my favorite quotes, from behaviorist Amos Tversky: &lt;br /&gt;It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more &lt;br /&gt;frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who &lt;br /&gt;have faith that they know exactly what’s going on. &lt;br /&gt;My friend Bruce Newberg thinks a quote attributed to Mark Twain says it best, and he &lt;br /&gt;may be right: &lt;br /&gt;It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know &lt;br /&gt;for sure that just ain't so. &lt;br /&gt;Over the last few years, some people went around saying, “We don’t know what bad &lt;br /&gt;thing will happen, but something will,” and others said, “We’re confident that &lt;br /&gt;nothing bad will happen.”  Now, as is often the case, unassuming caution seems to &lt;br /&gt;be winning out over cocksure optimism. &lt;br /&gt;UThe Seed &lt;br /&gt;This memo isn’t about the events of July 2007, but rather how recent events exemplify &lt;br /&gt;the time-honored pattern that kicks off the swing back of the pendulum.  That pattern &lt;br /&gt;often begins with a single seed, and sometimes one that’s hard to identify.  That difficulty &lt;br /&gt;isn’t there this time; it’s just that the seed seems so small compared with the &lt;br /&gt;repercussions. &lt;br /&gt;The seed of the current cyclical downturn sprouted in the area of subprime mortgages, &lt;br /&gt;residential loans made to homeowners with less-than-stellar creditworthiness.  The mere &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making of those loans didn’t create the problem.  Rather, it’s the fact that both borrowing &lt;br /&gt;and lending decisions were quite poor and in many cases misguided. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I described in “It’s All Good,” loan originators and mortgage brokers were &lt;br /&gt;incentivized by fees to generate loan volum&lt;br /&gt;e and often were able to do so without having &lt;br /&gt;to risk their own capital.  They were paid to produce quantity, not quality, and – surprise! &lt;br /&gt;– they did.  Capital providers’ lack of concern regarding creditworthiness enabled &lt;br /&gt;borrowers to borrow more than they could repay and more than was justified under &lt;br /&gt;prudent lending standards . . . at adjustable rates even if the borrowers couldn’t withstand &lt;br /&gt;an upward adjustment . . . often supported by inadequate documentation regarding &lt;br /&gt;incomes and assets.   Deficiencies in due diligence even permitted numerous cases of &lt;br /&gt;mortgage fraud, where borrowers bought houses, marked them up through sales to related &lt;br /&gt;parties, and then borrowed against them in amounts far in excess of their actual value &lt;br /&gt;(and their cost).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s not surprising that these circumstances combined to produce a high volume of &lt;br /&gt;deficient loans.  In fact, it would be amazing if they hadn’t.  Who could have looked at &lt;br /&gt;this system without expecting this outcome? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay – bad loans were made, and delinquencies and foreclosures have been rising among &lt;br /&gt;the weakest of mortgage borrowers.  How can these isolated developments have jumped &lt;br /&gt;the rails to affect commercial real estate?  How could they possibly have led to difficulty &lt;br /&gt;for the private equity industry, which does no mortgage lending?  And how can these &lt;br /&gt;specific linkages have been generalized into widespread repercussions on the economy &lt;br /&gt;and the credit and equity markets? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UContagion &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Among the many cyclical phenomena that recur regularly, one of the most &lt;br /&gt;interesting is the attitude toward contagion.  When the environment is rosy and &lt;br /&gt;market participants are optimistic, negative developments are described as “isolated &lt;br /&gt;incidents.”  Market participants find it easy to maintain their equilibrium, and the &lt;br /&gt;possibility of repercussions is easily dismissed.  This is no more realistic than what &lt;br /&gt;we see at the pessimistic end of the pendulum’s swing, where negatives are &lt;br /&gt;generalized into epidemics, contagion is overstated and participants totally lose their &lt;br /&gt;cool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Early in June, I met with Marty Fridson of FridsonVision.  Marty is a longtime friend and &lt;br /&gt;one of the deans of the high yield bond business – by any standard an expert on credit.  In &lt;br /&gt;his discussion of the subprime crisis, Marty referenced a complex flowchart labeled &lt;br /&gt;“Possible Paths to Contagion.”  It showed a number of ways in which the subprime &lt;br /&gt;problem could affect high yield bonds.  Linkages like these can be foreseen if you’re &lt;br /&gt;thoughtful and willing to look ahead.  Marty focused on contagion to high yield bonds, &lt;br /&gt;but I’ll discuss below how this small problem has spread far more broadly. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAnimal, Vegetable or Mineral? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These were the categories into which things fell on the old TV quiz show “Twenty &lt;br /&gt;Questions,” and they were always the subject of the panelists’ first question.  In the case &lt;br /&gt;of the subprime crisis, the factors contributing to contagion can be sorted into three other &lt;br /&gt;categories: fundamental, psychological and technical.  Here are some examples: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fundamental influences are those with tangible consequences for business.  When &lt;br /&gt;mortgage delinquencies rise sharply, first there are the obvious direct effects: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lenders lose money, and some go bankrupt.  &lt;br /&gt; Real estate brokers’ commissions dry up. &lt;br /&gt; Homebuilders see less demand for their product. &lt;br /&gt; Building materials companies see lower volumes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there are the second-order consequences, or what the British would call the “knock-&lt;br /&gt;on effects”:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Home prices fall.  Mortgages based on the old, high prices cannot be refinanced, and &lt;br /&gt;simple economics makes it smarter to default rather than service a $500,000 mortgage &lt;br /&gt;on what is now a $400,000 house.  Thus delinquencies rise further. &lt;br /&gt; Lower home prices at the bottom of the ladder ripple through other sectors of the &lt;br /&gt;housing market. &lt;br /&gt; All consumers feel poorer due to the negative wealth effect and curtail their &lt;br /&gt;expenditures, crimping revenues at retailers and then manufacturers. &lt;br /&gt; Borrowing declines, depressing the level of business at financial institutions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of these things have direct consequences for the economy and the markets – from just &lt;br /&gt;the little seed of bad subprime loans.  But there will also be extensive psychological &lt;br /&gt;repercussions: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Losses that are experienced – or even just imagined – cause investors and providers &lt;br /&gt;of capital to realize they’ve been overstating positives and understating negatives. &lt;br /&gt; Their confidence ebbs and they start to worry.  Thus they make less capital available &lt;br /&gt;for risky investments, or they charge more for the capital they will provide. &lt;br /&gt; Thus risk premiums and expected returns must rise if investors are to be induced to &lt;br /&gt;make further risk-bearing investments.  One way this happens is through higher &lt;br /&gt;interest rates – depressing consumer and business activity. &lt;br /&gt; Another way prospective returns are raised is through price declines for existing &lt;br /&gt;assets, and these can course through many markets.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, the environment is altered by technical factors that influence the supply/demand &lt;br /&gt;balance for capital and assets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As capital dries up, deals become less attractive (because the cost of capital is higher) &lt;br /&gt;and maybe downright impossible to execute (because capital is unavailable). &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If portfolio holdings have to be sold to reduce leverage or raise cash to meet actual or &lt;br /&gt;feared withdrawals, this has a depressant effect on asset prices that reinforces the &lt;br /&gt;cycle.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lower asset prices may lead to margin calls, and thus possibly to fire sales. &lt;br /&gt; Forced sellers sell what they can sell, not necessarily what they want to sell.  As a &lt;br /&gt;result, the prices of assets that are entirely unrelated to the fundamental problem can &lt;br /&gt;join the downward spiral.  It’s for this reason that they say, “In times of crisis, all &lt;br /&gt;correlations go to one.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every one of the above factors has been seen in the last few weeks – all growing from &lt;br /&gt;just the subprime seed.  The economy is still showing good strength overall and most &lt;br /&gt;companies are doing fine; the default rate among high yield bonds continues to run &lt;br /&gt;at 25-year lows.  But strong fundamentals mean little if technical factors combine &lt;br /&gt;with a fundamental problem to profoundly depress investor psychology. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s important to remember the extent to which these factors interrelate.  Fundamentals &lt;br /&gt;influence psychology, which determines technicals, which feed back to further affect &lt;br /&gt;fundamentals.  Just as these things can create a virtuous circle on the upside – such &lt;br /&gt;as the one that has prevailed since late-2002 – they’re now behind the apparent start &lt;br /&gt;of a vicious circle on the downside. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe L Word Revisited &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most explanations of the financial dynamism of the last few years have centered on &lt;br /&gt;something called “excess liquidity.”  Vast amounts of liquidity in the hands of investors, &lt;br /&gt;it’s been said, caused them to avidly pursue investments, neglect due diligence, accept &lt;br /&gt;low prospective returns, and therefore bid up asset prices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But where does excess liquidity come from?  Not from more currency.  The amount of &lt;br /&gt;currency in the world is somewhat fixed, and each person’s receipt is another person’s &lt;br /&gt;expenditure.  The fact that China has massive reserves to invest merely means those sums &lt;br /&gt;came out of someone else’s account. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the “L word” that should be focused on isn’t liquidity, but leverage.  This is &lt;br /&gt;the one I discussed in “It’s All Good,” and the element behind many of the excesses of &lt;br /&gt;late.  High levels of lending and borrowing relative to capital balances can increase buying &lt;br /&gt;power and fire up economies and markets.  The question is whether that expansion will be &lt;br /&gt;maintained and increased.  If not, this source of growth will peter out . . . as has been the &lt;br /&gt;case in the last few weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A decade or so back, the ability of parties other than the Fed to increase the leverage in &lt;br /&gt;the system was limited.  Margin debt for purchases of stock couldn’t exceed 100% of an &lt;br /&gt;investor’s equity, and bank loans likewise were restricted to a multiple of capital.  But in &lt;br /&gt;recent years, some new factors have meaningfully changed the picture, including &lt;br /&gt;derivatives, hedge funds and non-bank lending.  All three of these – among which there is &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;significant overlap – have negated the old limits and made vast amounts of leverage &lt;br /&gt;available to investors and asset buyers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This leveraging up was the greatest single element in the asset surge of the last few&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;years.  In fact, the breadth of the gains tells me we didn’t have an “asset bubble,” &lt;br /&gt;but rather a “leverage bubble.”  As Jeremy Grantham points out in his latest letter, &lt;br /&gt;leveraged loans (so-called “bank loans” often funded by hedge funds rather than banks) &lt;br /&gt;are a good candidate for the “bubble” label, as their volume in the first half of 2007, at &lt;br /&gt;$545 billion, was up 60% over the same period in 2006, which showed a similarly &lt;br /&gt;dramatic increase over 2005.  Leverage (along with the lowered standards that resulted &lt;br /&gt;from eagerness to put borrowed capital to work) was the common thread in much of the &lt;br /&gt;appreciation that took place across asset classes and regions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now we’re having a chance to see – once again – that the process works in both &lt;br /&gt;directions.  And as so often is the case, the air tends to come out of the balloon far &lt;br /&gt;faster (and more violently) than it went in.  The process is mesmerizing – like &lt;br /&gt;watching a train wreck happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Engine of Growth Seizes Up &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pervasiveness of leverage throughout the financial system means the slowing process &lt;br /&gt;comes in many forms and takes many twists and turns.  It’s not possible – or necessary – &lt;br /&gt;to enumerate all of them.  All we need are a couple of examples.  For these we’ll take a &lt;br /&gt;look at collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a simple example, consider commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS.  Over &lt;br /&gt;the last few months, Bruce Karsh has pointed out that prices for CMBS were falling even &lt;br /&gt;though the business of being a landlord was good and prices of buildings were increasing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His explanation has been that many CDOs held both subprime paper and the riskier &lt;br /&gt;tranches of CMBS.  Because of the developments in the subprime area, (1) they were &lt;br /&gt;affected by psychological contagion, (2) new ones couldn’t be formed, meaning CDOs &lt;br /&gt;ceased to be buyers of new CMBS, and (3) some faced the need to reduce their leverage &lt;br /&gt;and raise cash.  Unable to sell subprime assets (or not wishing to recognize losses if they &lt;br /&gt;could be deferred), they’ve been selling CMBS, putting downward pressure on prices.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s how problems in one asset class can depress prices in another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now let’s look a little deeper.  Bear in mind that CDO managers are paid to (1) issue debt &lt;br /&gt;in tranches that vary in terms of seniority and promised return and (2) use the proceeds to &lt;br /&gt;assemble portfolios of debt instruments.  Borrow and buy, borrow and buy.  A CDO &lt;br /&gt;manager’s compensation increases in proportion to the amounts involved and is locked in &lt;br /&gt;for the term of the CDO.  Thus CDO managers, like mortgage brokers, were motivated to &lt;br /&gt;play a major part in what I described in “The Race to the Bottom” in February: “a &lt;br /&gt;market where a desire for quantity and speed has taken over from an insistence on &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quality and caution.”  Not all managers succumbed to this temptation, of course, but it &lt;br /&gt;was there.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CDOs have been among the greatest contributors to the recent upswing.  To a large &lt;br /&gt;extent they were a bottomless pit that could never be filled, a prime s&lt;br /&gt;ource of &lt;br /&gt;demand for debt.  Why was their growth so strong?  Because they offered a terrific deal, &lt;br /&gt;attracting vast quantities of money that had to be invested.  What was that deal?  Simple: &lt;br /&gt;high-rated debt at low-grade yields. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too good to be true?  Of course.  The ratings were too high because rating agency &lt;br /&gt;analysts had to rate exotic structured products with which they had no experience (and &lt;br /&gt;probably no true understanding).  And I’m confident the CDO managers were very &lt;br /&gt;persuasive, using sophisticated statistical models to explain how safe they were thanks to &lt;br /&gt;portfolio diversification and over-collateralization.  For this reason, many tranches of &lt;br /&gt;CDOs stuffed with non-investment grade debt received investment grade ratings, looked &lt;br /&gt;cheap based on their attractive promised yields, and thus sold out rapidly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CDOs were among the greatest buyers of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) &lt;br /&gt;and non-investment grade leveraged loans.  I’ll bet some investors even leveraged up to &lt;br /&gt;buy the debt of these highly leveraged entities, which in turn used their capital to buy &lt;br /&gt;highly leveraged paper.  Could the end be in doubt?  This mode of response to the low-&lt;br /&gt;return environment of the last few years was doomed to end badly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now the fallacies in this approach have been exposed, with widespread ramifications: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Because the ability to create new CDOs may be greatly curtailed, they’re unlikely to &lt;br /&gt;represent much of a source of demand for new leveraged loans. &lt;br /&gt; In that case, future buyouts dependent on leveraged loan issuance won’t be funded as &lt;br /&gt;readily. &lt;br /&gt; Billions in bridge loans that investment banks extended for buyouts appear to be &lt;br /&gt;“hung” because of the difficulty in refinancing them through sales to investors. &lt;br /&gt; The investment banks behind the loans are likely to encounter substantial losses as &lt;br /&gt;they’re marked down to make them salable. &lt;br /&gt; Outstanding high yield bonds and leveraged loans will have to decline in price (and &lt;br /&gt;rise in yield) to make them competitive with this marked-down buyout paper. &lt;br /&gt; Debt that has been inventoried to facilitate the formation of new CDOs may have to &lt;br /&gt;be dumped at losses now that the CDO creation process has shrunk. &lt;br /&gt; Investment banks that made bridge loans and amassed inventories for non-existent &lt;br /&gt;CDOs may be unwilling to extend new financing from their balance sheets. &lt;br /&gt; Fewer buyouts will be able to be financed as long as the debt markets remain in this &lt;br /&gt;condition. &lt;br /&gt; Thus the “LBO put” may no longer be a force in the stock market, in which case &lt;br /&gt;investors will no longer be able to count on buyout funds to purchase companies at &lt;br /&gt;premium prices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the increase in subprime mortgage delinquencies lead to last week’s 580 point &lt;br /&gt;drop in the Dow?  These are some of the ways.  Fault lines run through portfolios, &lt;br /&gt;markets and economies, and usually they are exposed only in times of crisis.  The &lt;br /&gt;fault line this time came in the form of pervasive leverage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Role of Psychology &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the end of each day, Oaktree’s debt trading desk sends out an email recapping our &lt;br /&gt;buys and sells, along with market developments and the day’s biggest headlines.  On July &lt;br /&gt;26, (the day the Dow declined 312 points), one of the headlines read “Paulson Says &lt;br /&gt;Subprime-Mortgage Collapse Doesn’t Threaten Economic Growth.”   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the simplest level, there’s every reason to understand that the failure to make monthly &lt;br /&gt;payments on the part of a bunch of mortgage borrowers at the bottom of the credit ladder &lt;br /&gt;won’t have direct effects far beyond their local communities and the holders of their &lt;br /&gt;loans.  But (1) the government usually does a poor job of anticipating second-order &lt;br /&gt;consequences and (2) politicians have every incentive to act as cheerleaders for the &lt;br /&gt;economy and downplay the negatives.  Unlike distressed debt investors and other bargain &lt;br /&gt;hunters, no officeholder wants to see economic weakness, since it tends not to do much &lt;br /&gt;for re-electability.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even leaving aside this factor, the issue here comes down to the difference between the &lt;br /&gt;direct workings of the “real” economy and the follow-on effects of psychology.  I believe &lt;br /&gt;the latter are profound and have the ability to overwhelm the former.  In fact, I &lt;br /&gt;sometimes think there’s little to the economy other than psychology – and thus that &lt;br /&gt;the real economy simply can’t be distinguished from the psychological one.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If consumers feel insecure about their economic future, they won’t buy.   &lt;br /&gt; If they don’t expect consumers to buy, manufacturers of consumer goods will cut &lt;br /&gt;back production, and they certainly won’t produce to build inventories.  Instead &lt;br /&gt;they’ll downsize by laying off workers, further adding to consumer woes.   &lt;br /&gt; Pessimistic consumer goods manufacturers won’t invest in plant expansion, so &lt;br /&gt;construction companies and manufacturers of production equipment will suffer as &lt;br /&gt;well.   &lt;br /&gt; All of this will be exacerbated by the reduced willingness of worried lenders to &lt;br /&gt;provide debt capital, or at least their insistence on higher interest rates to cover the &lt;br /&gt;increased risks.   &lt;br /&gt; At the extreme, government tax revenues might decline, necessitating restrictive tax &lt;br /&gt;increases or the troubling growth of deficits.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s all a matter of expectations.  So when someone says, “psychological influences aside, &lt;br /&gt;I don’t think there’ll be much of an impact,” I wouldn’t give that statement much weight.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s entirely understandable that, despite favorable fundamentals, newly chastened &lt;br /&gt;investors have pulled back into their shells, largely because of the profound effect of a &lt;br /&gt;downturn in psychology. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*     *     * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;In the last few weeks, investors have learned some painful lessons.  They went from &lt;br /&gt;feeling they understood exactly what was going on to realizing they merely had been &lt;br /&gt;carried along in a rosy environment.  They learned (1) that they hadn’t accurately gauged &lt;br /&gt;the risks they were taking when they invested in innovative and highly leveraged &lt;br /&gt;structured entities, (2) that the rating agencies they’d relied on didn’t know either, and (3) &lt;br /&gt;that in understating risk they hadn’t demanded enough of a risk premium or sufficient &lt;br /&gt;protective covenants.  They learned the hard way that leverage m&lt;br /&gt;agnifies losses as well &lt;br /&gt;as gains.  And they learned that negative developments in a far-off corner of the economy &lt;br /&gt;can affect them profoundly.  There’s absolutely nothing new in any of this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In just the last two weeks, we’ve seen headlines such as these: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Subprime Uncertainty Fans Out &lt;br /&gt; Bear Stearns Tells Investors Funds Worthless &lt;br /&gt; Crisis Forces Banks to Make Hobson’s Choice &lt;br /&gt; Banks Delay Sale of Chrysler Debt As Market Stalls &lt;br /&gt; Chrysler, Boots Financing Woes Dim “Golden Era” for Leveraged Buyout Firms &lt;br /&gt; A Second Day of Declines Caps the Worst Wall Street Week in Years &lt;br /&gt; Credit Crunch May Derail Buyout Boom; LBOver &lt;br /&gt; Fears Intensify on Economy, Despite Growth &lt;br /&gt; Hedge Fund Deleveraging Could Be Next Big Worry &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What these developments mean for the future – and how far this swing toward negative &lt;br /&gt;events and negative psychology will go – is absolutely unknowable.  Is this just a bump &lt;br /&gt;in the road, like the Asia-related declines that rippled through markets in the second &lt;br /&gt;quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, from which the recovery was swift?  Or are &lt;br /&gt;these events the first steps toward a major credit crunch that will bring on a recession?  &lt;br /&gt;No one knows, including us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what we do know is that the bull-market excesses I decried in my memo of two &lt;br /&gt;weeks ago (and in “The New Paradigm” in October and “The Race to the Bottom” in &lt;br /&gt;February) have reversed for the moment, with profound effects on asset prices.  Just as &lt;br /&gt;risky companies could obtain ridiculously cheap and easy financing a month ago, &lt;br /&gt;now the debt of perfectly good companies is providing generous promised returns &lt;br /&gt;and sometimes is unsalable.  Oaktree bottom fishers who’ve felt like they’ve been &lt;br /&gt;cooling their heels for the last few years are smiling for a change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And mindfulness of cycles is on the way to being restored.  When things can’t get &lt;br /&gt;better – as some buyout GPs pointed out earlier this year – they won’t.  When the &lt;br /&gt;pendulum reaches the extreme of its arc, it will swing back.  When markets are &lt;br /&gt;priced for perfection, they will disappoint.   And when investors demand inadequate &lt;br /&gt;compensation for bearing risk, they will learn the error of their ways.  With the &lt;br /&gt;word “eventually” implicit in these statements, I’m 100% sure they’re all correct. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say, “This is it,” but I am willing to say, “This is more like it.”  It’ll always go &lt;br /&gt;this way.  Investors should learn that simple lesson.  But most never will.  That’s &lt;br /&gt;what the philosopher Santayana had in mind when he said, “Those who cannot remember &lt;br /&gt;the past are condemned to repeat it.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;July 30, 2007 &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks  &lt;br /&gt;Re: Now It’s All Bad? &lt;br /&gt;I’m a great believer in the cyclical nature of the markets, but I never cease to be amazed &lt;br /&gt;at how far they can go in one direction and for how long; the extremes they can reach, &lt;br /&gt;despite logical arguments to the contrary; and the swiftness of the swing back.  It all &lt;br /&gt;reminds me of a point I made in my second memo, “First Quarter Performance” (April &lt;br /&gt;1991): Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on &lt;br /&gt;average,” it actually spends very little of its time there.  Instead it is almost always &lt;br /&gt;swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc. &lt;br /&gt;Just seven weeks ago, I complained in “It’s All Good” that investors were acting as if &lt;br /&gt;nothing could go wrong.  “Priced for perfection” was the concept underlying values, and &lt;br /&gt;people were more than willing to pay prices set that way. &lt;br /&gt;Now, of course, the prevailing attitude appears to have swung from “it’s all good” to “it’s &lt;br /&gt;all bad.”  Pessimism has replaced optimism, pe rhaps also to excess.  There are days on &lt;br /&gt;which no one seems able to tell me how the developing credit crisis might be resolved in &lt;br /&gt;short order and a full-scale meltdown avoided, and when no one seems able to find a ray &lt;br /&gt;of sunshine in the current situation (other than bargain hunters). &lt;br /&gt;It’s like the aspiring actor who takes acting classes, waits on tables and hustles auditions &lt;br /&gt;for a decade . . . and then gets his big break and becomes an “overnight success.”  Except &lt;br /&gt;that in this case, having built up great excesses over a period I date from November 2002, &lt;br /&gt;people are now acting as if this market has become an overnight flop.   &lt;br /&gt;Some of us have been saying for years that a swing back of the market cycle was due, but &lt;br /&gt;it took a long time to happen (calling to mind, as so often in my case, the dictum that &lt;br /&gt;“being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong”).  This delay &lt;br /&gt;does a good job of illustrating Lord Keynes’s famous observation that “markets can &lt;br /&gt;remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” &lt;br /&gt;Markets can swing in a single direction for a longer period and to a greater extent than &lt;br /&gt;anyone might expect.  That’s crowd psychology.  But the swing back can be equally &lt;br /&gt;surprising – in terms of what kicks it off and how fast it moves.  I recently came across a &lt;br /&gt;great quote from Larry Summ&lt;br /&gt;ers: “in economics things happen slower than you expected &lt;br /&gt;they would but when they finally do, they happen faster than you imagined they could.”  &lt;br /&gt;Certainly the recent transition from all good to all bad demonstrates this phenomenon. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UThe Virtuous Circle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The financial world seems to have melted down in just a few weeks.  But the truth is, the &lt;br /&gt;seeds of the crisis have been growing for years – unnoticed by most – as a seemingly &lt;br /&gt;virtuous circle spun unabated.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henry Kissinger was a member of TCW’s board when I worked there, and a few times &lt;br /&gt;each year I was privileged to hear him hold forth on world affairs.  Someone would ask, &lt;br /&gt;“Henry, can you explain yesterday’s events in Bosnia?” and he’d say, “Well, in 1722 . . .”  &lt;br /&gt;The point is that chain reaction-type events can only be understood in the context of that &lt;br /&gt;which went before.  The challenge is figuring out how far back to go.  In talking about &lt;br /&gt;how the market got to its current condition, I’ll just look back five years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone remembers the last corporate debt crisis, during the summer of 2002.  &lt;br /&gt;Recession, credit crunch, 9/11, Afghanistan, the telecom meltdown, and scandals at &lt;br /&gt;Enron and the like combined to make bonds available at ridiculously high yields.  Those &lt;br /&gt;who were willing to buy had an opportunity to earn ultra-high returns with what turned &lt;br /&gt;out to be very little risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Around the beginning of November 2002, however, it felt like a switch was thrown.   &lt;br /&gt;Maybe distressed debt managers who hadn’t been aggressive enough during the summer &lt;br /&gt;concluded they had to get invested before year-end.  For whatever reason, bond prices &lt;br /&gt;started to rise.  Our active distressed debt funds gained 20% that month, and the markets &lt;br /&gt;never looked back.  Investors in all asset classes forgot the panic that had gripped them &lt;br /&gt;just a few months earlier and became preoccupied with making money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because only modest returns were expected from high grade bonds (with their 4-5% &lt;br /&gt;yields) and U.S. common stocks (following the 2000-02 bear market), investors sought &lt;br /&gt;solutions in non-traditional investments with brief track records at best, and thus little or &lt;br /&gt;no clarity regarding the risks involved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vast sums flowed to hedge funds, and thousands of new ones were formed.  High yield &lt;br /&gt;bonds and leveraged loans began to be issued again . . . because now there were buyers.  &lt;br /&gt;This enabled buyouts to be financed and then recapitalized, and quick payouts to equity &lt;br /&gt;holders resulted in eye-popping IRRs, attracting more capital to buyout funds.  Real &lt;br /&gt;estate attracted vast amounts of capital, too, even when “cap rates” – current cash yields – &lt;br /&gt;sunk below 5%; what could be better than a tangible asset providing inflation protection? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Borrowing power became virtually unlimited, as is often the case when providers of &lt;br /&gt;capital are eager to put money to work.  Thus the financial environment reflected (1) a &lt;br /&gt;vast ability to leverage, (2) an uninhibited search for return, and (3) investors competing &lt;br /&gt;to make investments by accepting lower returns and decreased safety.  This combination &lt;br /&gt;supported new investment techniques, which grew rapidly despite being untested.  &lt;br /&gt;Securitization, tranching and selling onward were employed extensively, often in &lt;br /&gt;combination.  For investors seeking high returns in a low-return world, leverage &lt;br /&gt;seemed to hold the answer, and it was used in ways never seen  &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before.  Collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations, for example, &lt;br /&gt;grew practically unchecked.  These debt factories bought up vast amounts of raw material &lt;br /&gt;– in the form of underlying portfolio assets – in order to generate a salable product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line of it all: high leverage, untested vehicles and inadequate &lt;br /&gt;preparedness for adverse developments.  Little awareness of risk, low credit &lt;br /&gt;standards, slender risk premiums and little ma&lt;br /&gt;rgin for error.  In short, a recipe for &lt;br /&gt;possible disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Vicious Circle &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to explain what happens at this point in the typical market cycle: &lt;br /&gt;eventually, everything goes the other way.  That’s exactly what happened this summer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s a bump in the road.  It doesn’t matter what it is, and it’s usually different each &lt;br /&gt;time.  This year the problem occurred in the field of subprime mortgages.  There was a &lt;br /&gt;surprising rise in delinquencies, the immediate effect of which was limited to a small &lt;br /&gt;segment of the economy and the few investors who’d bought securities backed by these &lt;br /&gt;loans.  In the months leading up to July, the impact went largely undetected outside the &lt;br /&gt;subprime arena.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But from time to time in the investment world, a chain reaction is set off – maybe &lt;br /&gt;you’d say a “tipping point” is reached – which causes one sort of problem to create &lt;br /&gt;others and to cascade from one asset class, market or region to others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the first step toward a broadening-out of the subprime problem came in a few days &lt;br /&gt;during which rating agencies downgraded hundreds of mortgage-backed securities and &lt;br /&gt;the debt of CDOs built on them.  The repercussions were many and swift.  Not only did &lt;br /&gt;the downgradings have a direct negative effect on mortgage portfolios and their holders, &lt;br /&gt;but they provided a wake-up call, a shocking reminder of some forgotten realities:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That risk had been underestimated. &lt;br /&gt; That things investors thought they knew – truths they held so strongly – they really &lt;br /&gt;hadn’t known at all.    &lt;br /&gt; That elements they had relied on – in this case, debt ratings – had let them down.  &lt;br /&gt;Nothing works, they were reminded, except analysis that is first-hand, in-depth and &lt;br /&gt;superior.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there were the holders’ problems.  Bear Stearns, for example, announced significant &lt;br /&gt;losses in two of its hedge funds, as falling prices for subprime holdings rendered &lt;br /&gt;collateral inadequate and margin calls eliminated maneuvering room.  A few days later, it &lt;br /&gt;was reported that the investors’ equity was all gone.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then there are technical factors.  These are developments that encourage selling or &lt;br /&gt;deter buying but are unrelated to investment fundamentals.  A number soon arose:   &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, market participants realized how hard it can be to value obscure, &lt;br /&gt;infrequently-traded assets and how much the prices of such assets can diverge from &lt;br /&gt;their value.  In fact, “value” can be an empty concept in times of crisis, when it &lt;br /&gt;becomes painfully clear that an asset is only worth what it can be sold for.  Thus &lt;br /&gt;people came to question the prices funds were using to value subprime-related &lt;br /&gt;holdings, as well as the model-derived prices their investment bank creators had &lt;br /&gt;charged for them&lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worried about both subprime fundamentals and pricing, and suddenly under &lt;br /&gt;increased scrutiny, many lenders stopped providing financing.  Short-term &lt;br /&gt;commercial paper, which many investors had used to leverage their subprime-related &lt;br /&gt;asset investments, became largely impossible to roll over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Funds that had promised liquidity to their investors – even some money market funds &lt;br /&gt;– became worried about their ability to accurately value subprime holdings and sell &lt;br /&gt;them at fair prices.  Thus they suspended withdrawals.  What could have a more &lt;br /&gt;traumatic effect on investor confidence? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Where leverage was withdrawn, margin calls arrived, or funds had to meet actual or &lt;br /&gt;feared withdrawals, holders of subprime assets became forced sellers.  Few things &lt;br /&gt;have a more devastating effect on investment performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UMetastasis &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fundamental, psychological and technical influences described above devastated the &lt;br /&gt;market for subprime investments, of course, but they also spread quickly to other assets &lt;br /&gt;and markets and metastasized into new forms of trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investor psychology turned in all markets, even those totally unconnected to subprime &lt;br /&gt;loans.  Caution replaced optimism.  Risk aversion took over from risk tolerance (or risk-&lt;br /&gt;blindness).  Skepticism and the concept of capital preservation were resurrected.  &lt;br /&gt;Concern over being under-invested gave way to fear of buying too soon.  Cash came to &lt;br /&gt;be viewed as a source of security and buying power, not a drag on results.  All over the &lt;br /&gt;investment world, people started to think more about what can go wrong rather than what &lt;br /&gt;can go right.  In short, the things that contributed to the virtuous circle began to be &lt;br /&gt;reversed, in ways that were unimaginable just two months ago.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bridge financing for buyouts represents an outstanding example.  Buyouts were an area &lt;br /&gt;of great enthusiasm – and some of the greatest excesses, I think – in the 2002-07 up leg: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Vast sums were raised in buyout funds, likely increasing the managers’ motivation to &lt;br /&gt;buy companies. &lt;br /&gt; Purchase prices for target companies were lifted by stock market strength, bidding &lt;br /&gt;wars and the demands of stockholders and boards. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Acceptable debt/equity ratios – and thus the prices funds were willing to pay for &lt;br /&gt;companies – increased as the cost of debt financing fell. &lt;br /&gt; Companies became even more leveraged as recapitalizations allowed debt&lt;br /&gt; to replace &lt;br /&gt;equity on post-acquisition balance sheets.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although purchase prices and leverage ratios were rising rapidly, the banks were ready &lt;br /&gt;and willing to “bridge” – or accept the risk involved in completing – future financings for &lt;br /&gt;buyouts.  Often this came in the form of “staple financing,” through which banks enabled &lt;br /&gt;buyers to include committed financing as a component of their bids. As of a month ago, &lt;br /&gt;banks had committed to supply $277 billion of financing for buyouts, a figure that omits &lt;br /&gt;equity bridges (promises to raise some of the equity required in a buyout) as well as non-&lt;br /&gt;U.S. transactions.  These bridges have become one of the big stories of 2007. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prior to July, investors competed to put money to work despite rising buyout prices, &lt;br /&gt;increasing leverage ratios, declining yield spreads and weaker terms and covenants.  The &lt;br /&gt;banks counted on this eagerness in extending their financing commitments, and for years &lt;br /&gt;they were not disappointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then the negative developments in subprime mortgages reminded investors about &lt;br /&gt;risk.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The sight of funds melting down and suspending withdrawals was sobering.   &lt;br /&gt; Worry about the economic impact of falling home prices and less buoyant consumer &lt;br /&gt;spending became pervasive.   &lt;br /&gt; In this new, chastened environment, investors who’d bought CLO and CDO debt &lt;br /&gt;realized they had put too much faith in favorable ratings and thus were in trouble.  &lt;br /&gt;This caused their appetite for debt to dry up.   &lt;br /&gt; Bond pricing and terms no longer seemed adequate – and the risk associated with &lt;br /&gt;declining to purchase a new issue no longer loomed so large.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, in the unique way in which markets can turn from red-hot to frigid, potential &lt;br /&gt;buyers lost interest in the financings the banks had committed to place.  And so the &lt;br /&gt;bridges became “hung.”  The banks recognize that this isn’t par paper anymore, and thus &lt;br /&gt;they’re likely to accept discount bids to clear it off their balance sheets.  Observers &lt;br /&gt;describe this process by saying “risk has been repriced.”  They mean investors now &lt;br /&gt;realize they’ve been accepting inadequate compensation for bearing risk and are &lt;br /&gt;insisting on more.  “Risk repricing” is a good term for what’s happening.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly this phenomenon isn’t limited to subprime debt and bridge financings.  In fact, &lt;br /&gt;the complete list of impacted securities, markets and participants is staggeringly long and &lt;br /&gt;diverse: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; subprime loans, and thus large amounts of residential mortgage-backed securities and &lt;br /&gt;CDO debt, &lt;br /&gt; money market funds that experienced losses in subprime-backed paper and were &lt;br /&gt;forced to freeze redemptions, &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alt-A mortgages – not subprime, but similarly weak on documentation, &lt;br /&gt; mortgage lenders, &lt;br /&gt; commercial mortgage-backed securities, not because rents or property values are &lt;br /&gt;down, but because these securities may be held by residential m&lt;br /&gt;ortgage investors &lt;br /&gt;forced to raise cash, &lt;br /&gt; bridge financings – and with them the likelihood of future buyouts looking anything &lt;br /&gt;like those of the recent past, &lt;br /&gt; the investment and commercial banks that committed to the bridges, &lt;br /&gt; the stocks of target companies in announced buyouts that are shaky as to completion &lt;br /&gt;and/or likely to be renegotiated, &lt;br /&gt; merger arbitrageurs, or “risk arbs,” who assumed the risk of these deals failing to be &lt;br /&gt;consummated as announced,  &lt;br /&gt; others who bet that good times and low volatility would continue, and that probable &lt;br /&gt;things would happen and improbable things wouldn’t.  These include sellers of put &lt;br /&gt;options and credit default insurance, &lt;br /&gt; “quant firms” that built highly leveraged portfolios with help from models that &lt;br /&gt;extrapolated past market behavior, &lt;br /&gt; hedge funds and other leveraged investors in a wide variety of fields that pursued &lt;br /&gt;“spread” or “carry” trades using large amounts of borrowed money (more on this &lt;br /&gt;later), &lt;br /&gt; banks (e.g., Germany’s IKB) and fund managers (e.g., Carlyle and KKR) that formed &lt;br /&gt;highly leveraged subsidiaries that would employ extensive leverage in the pursuit of &lt;br /&gt;profit,   &lt;br /&gt; anyone dependent on issuing commercial paper or other forms of short-term debt to &lt;br /&gt;finance leveraged investments, and &lt;br /&gt; CLOs and CDOs, their investors, and those who depended on them to continue &lt;br /&gt;buying debt providing inadequate risk compensation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The list of affected areas is long and could grow longer.  On bad days, losses on U.S. &lt;br /&gt;stocks, European stocks and emerging market stocks all are attributed to the credit &lt;br /&gt;crunch.  Exchange rate swings – and strength in the yen in particular – are blamed on &lt;br /&gt;declining use of the carry trade, a regular feature of which was borrowing at low rates in &lt;br /&gt;Japan and investing for more elsewhere.  And the other day, I read that lower profits at &lt;br /&gt;London investment banks will likely result in smaller bonuses for investment bankers . . . &lt;br /&gt;and thus in lower prices for London real estate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How could investors in the areas listed above have expected that a crisis in subprime &lt;br /&gt;mortgages would affect them this way?  Who would have guessed, for example, that low-&lt;br /&gt;grade mortgage delinquencies would depress returns on risk arb funds?  The New York &lt;br /&gt;Times of August 18 described A Demon of Our Own Design, by Richard Bookstaber (see &lt;br /&gt;“Investment Miscellany,” November 2000) as pointing out that “the proliferation of &lt;br /&gt;complex financial products like derivatives, combined with use of leverage to bolster &lt;br /&gt;returns, will inevitably mean that there will be a regular stream of market contagions like &lt;br /&gt;the one we’re having now – one of which, someday, could be calamitous.”   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern of contagion exemplifies the hidden fault lines that I say can run &lt;br /&gt;through portfolios and – like construction flaws in California homes – become &lt;br /&gt;apparent only during infrequent catastrophes.  But their invisibility most of the time &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t mean they’re not there.  The existence of these common threads is one of the &lt;br /&gt;things that make it difficult to predict the correlation between assets, one of the key &lt;br /&gt;ingredients in intelligent portfolio construction.  And it’s a good reason to attach a &lt;br /&gt;significant premium&lt;br /&gt; to managers with alpha, or superior investment insight and skill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ULeverage and Liquidity  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s clear that when the story of 2002-07 is written, leverage and liquidity will be &lt;br /&gt;among the main players.  For much of the last few years, we saw a vast appetite for &lt;br /&gt;securities.  It created enormous demand for – and pushed up prices of – real estate- and &lt;br /&gt;asset-backed paper, CLO and CDO debt, buyout funds, hedge funds, high yield bonds &lt;br /&gt;and leveraged loans.  In fact, there seemed to be unlimited demand for non-mainstream &lt;br /&gt;investments.  With all that money to put to work, few potential buyers refrained from &lt;br /&gt;participating in an upswing that some observers thought lacked a sufficient raison d’être, &lt;br /&gt;reasonable limits and adequate risk compensation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the factors contributing most strongly to that demand was an ability to &lt;br /&gt;borrow excessive amounts, for questionable purposes, on loose terms and at a low &lt;br /&gt;cost.  It was a result of the unattractiveness of yields on high grade debt . . . which &lt;br /&gt;stemmed largely from the Fed’s campaign to lower interest rates in order to mitigate the &lt;br /&gt;depressant effect of the stock market slump and recession.  It was abetted by the fact that &lt;br /&gt;after a few years of good results, many people forget how money is lost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Extensive use of leverage was behind many of the gains of the last few years, and it is at &lt;br /&gt;the root of many of the problems being suffered today.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I mistake not, the distress . . . was produced by an enemy more &lt;br /&gt;formidable than hostile armies; by a pestilence more deadly than fever or &lt;br /&gt;plague; by a visitation more destructive than the frosts of Spring or the &lt;br /&gt;blights of Summer.  I believe that it was caused by a mountain load of &lt;br /&gt;DEBT. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flowery commentary on the crisis of 2007?  No; according to the Financial Times, the &lt;br /&gt;quote from T.E. Burton’s Crises and Depressions refers to events that occurred in 1857.  &lt;br /&gt;The point is that leverage is nothing new, and neither are its deleterious effects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are numerous reasons to use debt to leverage results, and none of them is likely to &lt;br /&gt;evaporate any time soon: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Hope springs eternal, as my mother used to say, and greed usually drives markets.   &lt;br /&gt;Thus any tool that has the power to magnify gains is very tempting. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Of course, leverage can magnify losses as well as gains.  But investors make &lt;br /&gt;investments because they expect them to work, not fail, and thus the attraction of &lt;br /&gt;magnified gains far outweighs the fear of magnified losses. &lt;br /&gt;3.&lt;br /&gt; Long-term bonds almost always offer higher yields than short-term debt, and &lt;br /&gt;riskier investments invariably seem to promise higher returns than safe ones.  &lt;br /&gt;For these reasons, using short-term borrowings to finance lower grade and/or &lt;br /&gt;longer-term investments invariably appears likely to produce positive returns.   &lt;br /&gt;4. Most seductively, the incremental risk entailed in investments that are slightly longer &lt;br /&gt;in term or slightly lower in quality usually appears quite small.  For this reason, &lt;br /&gt;these trades seem safe – but that doesn’t mean they can’t be rendered extremely &lt;br /&gt;risky when leveraged up enough. &lt;br /&gt;5. Of course, when an upward cycle is generating strong returns and making risk &lt;br /&gt;aversion recede, the equation becomes even more attractive.  In the FT column that &lt;br /&gt;provided the above quotation, John Authers describes the regular pattern of good &lt;br /&gt;times, easy credit, increasing leverage and eventual crashes.  I don’t see that ever &lt;br /&gt;changing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s for these reasons – and especially #4 – that highly leveraged positions are at the &lt;br /&gt;root of most fund collapses.  Long-Term Capital Management, the Granite Fund, &lt;br /&gt;Amaranth Advisors, the two Bear Stearns funds, Sowood Alpha Fund and Basis Yield &lt;br /&gt;Alpha Fund were all marked by “safe” positions leveraged to the sky.  And they all &lt;br /&gt;melted down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a number of ways, perpetuation of the market conditions of the last few years was &lt;br /&gt;dependent on several assumptions about liquidity:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; that investors with liquidity would be eager to put it to work, &lt;br /&gt; that providers of capital would make liquidity available, meaning that leveraged &lt;br /&gt;investors would be able to maintain their portfolio holdings and buy more, &lt;br /&gt; that securities markets would remain liquid, such that holdings could always be sold &lt;br /&gt;at prices close to their intrinsic value, and &lt;br /&gt; that funds would therefore be able to keep the promise of liquidity that they’d made &lt;br /&gt;to their investors.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, it was assumed that liquidity would continue to flow in the direction of &lt;br /&gt;leveraged investment funds (in the form of financing and incremental capital &lt;br /&gt;commitments) rather than away (in the form of margin calls and investor &lt;br /&gt;withdrawals).  Two or three months ago the world was described daily as “awash in &lt;br /&gt;liquidity.”  Where is it now? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investments requiring nothing more than the perpetuation of favorable market &lt;br /&gt;conditions can be very seductive.  And they work most of the time . . .  until the pit &lt;br /&gt;has been dug deep enough, the branches have been spread, and everyone has &lt;br /&gt;forgotten about the existence of risk.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment environment of the last few years could have been negatively impacted &lt;br /&gt;by the removal of any one of the elements of liquidity listed above.  But if you look at the &lt;br /&gt;list, it becomes clear that they’re hi&lt;br /&gt;ghly interrelated.  Weakening one assumption could &lt;br /&gt;render the others less reliable.  And, in truth, a single exogenous development – such as a &lt;br /&gt;major decline in psychology – could simultaneously harm them all.  That’s the main story &lt;br /&gt;of the last few weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Investments costing many times the investor’s equity.  Dependence on unreliable &lt;br /&gt;short-term financing.  Susceptibility to margin calls or capital withdrawals.  Assets &lt;br /&gt;that can become unsalable at a moment’s notice.  Prices that can collapse because &lt;br /&gt;the markets are thin and everyone wants out at the same time.  The formula is &lt;br /&gt;simple and the results are predictable.  Not every fund that’s so disposed collapses, &lt;br /&gt;but the potential’s always there – with borrowing to buy at its core. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fundamental problems are present in most investment conflagrations, but exposure to &lt;br /&gt;excessive leverage and disappearing liquidity is often the accelerant.  As &lt;br /&gt;breakingviews.com (my new favorite) put it in The Wall Street Journal of August 2, &lt;br /&gt;“The markets may hurt you, but your lenders will finish you off.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;URisk Reduction &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of the many fairy tales told over the last few years, one of the most seductive – and thus &lt;br /&gt;dangerous – was the one about global risk reduction.  It went this way: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The risk of economic cycles has been eased by adroit central bank management.   &lt;br /&gt; Because of globalization, risk has been spread worldwide rather than concentrated &lt;br /&gt;geographically.   &lt;br /&gt; Securitization and syndication have distributed risk to many market participants &lt;br /&gt;rather than leaving it concentrated with just a few.   &lt;br /&gt; Risk has been “tranched out” to the investors best able to bear it.  &lt;br /&gt; Leverage has become less risky because interest rates and debt terms are so much &lt;br /&gt;more borrower-friendly. &lt;br /&gt; Leveraged buyouts are safer because the companies being bought are fundamentally &lt;br /&gt;stronger. &lt;br /&gt; Risk can be hedged by long/short and absolute return investing and through the use of &lt;br /&gt;derivatives designed for that purpose. &lt;br /&gt; Improvements in computers, mathematics and modeling have made the markets better &lt;br /&gt;understood and thus less risky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As described in “It’s All Good . . . Really?” I thought many things that hinted at risk &lt;br /&gt;reduction actually had the effect of decreasing understanding and increasing risk.  Up to &lt;br /&gt;July, all we read about was the beneficial nature of these developments.  Now, with the &lt;br /&gt;benefit of hindsight, these are the judgments of our leading business periodicals: &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system designed to distribute and absorb risk might, instead, have bred it, by &lt;br /&gt;making it so easy for investors to buy complex securities they didn’t fully &lt;br /&gt;understand.  (The Wall Street Journal, August 7) &lt;br /&gt;[Loans] are now often bundled into securities that are sold in pieces to &lt;br /&gt;investors around the world, changing hands ma&lt;br /&gt;ny times.  It spreads risk, &lt;br /&gt;which policy makers believe keeps the overall financial system sound and &lt;br /&gt;stable.  But the downside to this system could be serious.  (WSJ, August &lt;br /&gt;10) &lt;br /&gt;“The market appears to be finding it harder to truly understand the &lt;br /&gt;inherent and underlying risks involved,” [according to Chris Rexworthy, a &lt;br /&gt;former regulator with Britain’s FSA].  The backlash is particularly sharp &lt;br /&gt;abroad, in countries that were surprised to find that problems with United &lt;br /&gt;States homeowners could be felt so keenly in their home markets.  (New &lt;br /&gt;York Times, August 31) &lt;br /&gt;“Low volatility has created complacency, and that has translated into &lt;br /&gt;poorly structured derivative markets,” says Randall Dodd, director of the &lt;br /&gt;Financial Policy Forum . . .  The low volatility world of the past few years &lt;br /&gt;may have worsened the situation, leading to lax lending standards for &lt;br /&gt;derivative investors.  (WSJ, August 2) &lt;br /&gt;It is estimated that there are seven times as many credit derivatives &lt;br /&gt;outstanding as there are outstanding bonds.  You need to ask the question: &lt;br /&gt;is risk being transferred or created?  Are the new gladiators hedging with &lt;br /&gt;derivatives or just leveraging up?  (Jeff Pantages in Pensions &amp; &lt;br /&gt;Investments, August 20) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An apt metaphor came from Pension &amp; Investments:  “Jill Fredston is a nationally &lt;br /&gt;recognized avalanche expert . . .  She knows about a kind of moral hazard risk, where &lt;br /&gt;better safety gear can entice climbers to take more risk – making them in fact less safe.”   &lt;br /&gt;Like opportunities to make money, the degree of risk present in a market derives &lt;br /&gt;from the behavior of the participants, not from securities, strategies and institutions.  &lt;br /&gt;Regardless of what’s designed into market structures, risk will be low only if &lt;br /&gt;investors behave prudently.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that tales like this one about risk control rarely turn out to be &lt;br /&gt;true.  Risk cannot be eliminated; it just gets transferred and spread.  And &lt;br /&gt;developments that make the world look less risky usually are illusory, and thus in &lt;br /&gt;presenting a rosy picture they tend to make the world more risky.  These are among &lt;br /&gt;the important lessons of 2007. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UOther Lessons Not Learned &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition to the above, a number of other recurring themes can be seen as underlying &lt;br /&gt;the recent difficulties.  Here are a few: &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; UBelief in market efficiencyU – Although academics say the actions of intelligent &lt;br /&gt;investors cause assets to be priced right, I often find prices screwy.  Rather than &lt;br /&gt;increasing market efficiency, improvements in computer and communications &lt;br /&gt;technology may have made the markets even more unstable.  As my partner Sheldon &lt;br /&gt;Stone says, it’s like a cruise ship where everyone is told to stand on the port side.  &lt;br /&gt;Then everyone simultaneously gets a message telling them to run to starboard.  It &lt;br /&gt;makes for a rocky crossing.  The New York Times wrote on August 17 that &lt;br /&gt;“Information may arrive instantly, but insight takes longer.”  Certainly the cycles &lt;br /&gt;don’t seem any less volatile than they used to be, or the extremes any less irrational.  &lt;br /&gt;In fact, in recent years, over-reliance on market efficiency may have kept people from &lt;br /&gt;questioning asset prices.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UInefficacy of modelsU – Quant funds invest according to models that extrapolate past &lt;br /&gt;patterns, operated by people who know computers and probabilities, not investment &lt;br /&gt;fundamentals.  But models can’t tell you when past market behavior has been &lt;br /&gt;irrational (and thus unreliable), and they can’t predict when those patterns will &lt;br /&gt;change.  They lead to investments that “would have worked almost all the time in the &lt;br /&gt;past,” but it’s amazing how often we see them derailed by once-in-a-lifetime events.  &lt;br /&gt;Matthew Rothman of Lehman Brothers has become famous for saying in early &lt;br /&gt;August that “events that models only predicted would happen once in 10,000 years &lt;br /&gt;happened every day for three days.”  Are those models you want to bet on? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UDi-worst-ificationU – Warren Buffett harps on the folly of branching out into things &lt;br /&gt;you know less about solely for the purpose of increasing the number of baskets in &lt;br /&gt;which you have your eggs.  Investing in things about which you aren’t expert doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;reduce risk, it increases it.  And I think it’s particularly unwise to finance &lt;br /&gt;diversification with borrowed money.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UConflicts between managers and clientsU – Investors should look very closely at the &lt;br /&gt;alignment of their managers’ interests with their own.  The mere fact that a manager &lt;br /&gt;is working for incentive compensation, or has money in his fund, isn’t enough.  &lt;br /&gt;Recent events have shed some unusual – and provocative – light on the question of &lt;br /&gt;alignment.  Consider Sowood Capital, which lost half of its investors’ capital, sold off &lt;br /&gt;its portfolio in a block and closed down.  Why did the loss of half the LPs’ equity &lt;br /&gt;occasion a liquidation?  Might further losses have activated a clawback of previous &lt;br /&gt;years’ incentive fees?  And might the interests of a manager with 100% of his net &lt;br /&gt;worth in his fund have diverged from the interests of LPs who invested 1% of theirs?  &lt;br /&gt;I’m just speculating from the sidelines without knowledge of the facts in this &lt;br /&gt;situation, but I wonder whether this doesn’t show that to protect their own investment &lt;br /&gt;in their funds, managers can be driven to take actions that damage their LPs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe unreliability of ratingsU – Many investors act in reliance on ratings, and some &lt;br /&gt;require ratings before taking actions they’re considering.  But ratings must be taken &lt;br /&gt;with a big grain of salt.  In fact, a lot of my career (and Oaktree’s success) has &lt;br /&gt;been based on conviction that the rating agencies are often wrong.  They &lt;br /&gt;routinely rate securities too high when things are going well, and then overcorrect &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when problems surface.  It’s instructive to note that a lot of CDO debt built on &lt;br /&gt;subprime mortgages received triple-A ratings, many of which already have required &lt;br /&gt;downward adjustment.  And that rating agencies helped CDO managers design &lt;br /&gt;structures so they would receive the desired rating.  And that managers would run a &lt;br /&gt;structure past a few agencies and hire&lt;br /&gt; the one that arrived at the highest rating.  And &lt;br /&gt;that ratings are paid for by those sponsoring the securities being rated, &lt;br /&gt;something &lt;br /&gt;which sounds like a trial where the defendant picks and pays the judge.   &lt;br /&gt;All of these paragraphs highlight errors made by investors this time around . . . of a type &lt;br /&gt;that always will be made (but with variations on the theme).  The lesson isn’t to distrust &lt;br /&gt;managers, or models, or ratings, or diversification, or market efficiency.   &lt;br /&gt;What investors must learn – but most will not – is that there’s no easy answer, &lt;br /&gt;surefire tool or silver bullet.  Lots of tools will help when applied thoughtfully, but &lt;br /&gt;they’ll    bring harm otherwise – with the additional risk that excessive reliance on them &lt;br /&gt;will increase the damage done when they turn out to be unavailing.  Certainly none of &lt;br /&gt;the highly-touted things discussed above held the answer this time around.  Only &lt;br /&gt;truly superior skill, discipline and integrity are likely to &lt;br /&gt;produce consistently high &lt;br /&gt;returns in the long run with limited risk.   &lt;br /&gt;My advice:  expect CEOs, regulators, rating agencies and other market participants to &lt;br /&gt;make mistakes.  Expect things to go wrong and cycles to swing to extremes and then &lt;br /&gt;recover.  Worry about outcomes, and hire worriers.  Doing these things is sure to stand &lt;br /&gt;between you and top returns in up-cycles, but it will deliver some degree of safety when &lt;br /&gt;things turn bad.  Ensuring the protection of capital under adverse circumstances is &lt;br /&gt;incompatible with maximizing returns in good times, and thus investors must &lt;br /&gt;choose between the two.  That’s the real lesson. The things discussed above are just &lt;br /&gt;a few of the details. &lt;br /&gt;What Next? &lt;br /&gt;Lots of people are asking whether this is going to get ugly.  Is this the beginning of a &lt;br /&gt;credit crunch?  Will it lead to a recession?  How bad will it get?  When will the bottom be &lt;br /&gt;reached?  How long will the recovery take?&lt;br /&gt;  The answer’s simple: no one knows. &lt;br /&gt;Some of the psychological and technical preconditions for a challenging market &lt;br /&gt;environment have been met.  The bubble of positive investor psychology has been &lt;br /&gt;pricked and could become seriously deflated.  When others are aggressive, we should &lt;br /&gt;be worried, but when others are worried, we can be confident.  That’s&lt;br /&gt; the essence of &lt;br /&gt;contrarianism, and by that standard these are better times. &lt;br /&gt;The easy-money machine has had some sa&lt;br /&gt;nd thrown in its gears and seems to be grinding &lt;br /&gt;to a halt.  Previously, anyone could get any amount of money for any purpose.   Right &lt;br /&gt;now, deserving borrowers are unable to obtain financing, and this could c&lt;br /&gt;ontinue or get &lt;br /&gt;worse. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook for the economy is murky, as usual.  It continues to limp along, not growing &lt;br /&gt;strongly but not sagging.  The big question surrounds the effect of the subprime crisis on &lt;br /&gt;consumers.  Home prices are through rising.  Home equity borrowing is probably &lt;br /&gt;finished for a while as a supporter of consumer spending.  Ditto for the “wealth effect.”  &lt;br /&gt;The reset of&lt;br /&gt; adjustable rate mortgages from artificially low teaser rates to full market &lt;br /&gt;rates over the next 18-24 months is likely to have a depressing effect on a large number &lt;br /&gt;of households, and thus on the economy.  I would think furniture and auto manufacturers, &lt;br /&gt;building materials suppliers, retailers and financial institutions have seen their best days &lt;br /&gt;for a while.  I consider the economy unpredictable, of course, and thus a lot of people’s &lt;br /&gt;answers will be more definite than mine.  But not necessarily more correct. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s looking to the Fed to take action.  Its last act – cutting the discount rate on &lt;br /&gt;August 17 – was largely symbolic but had a positive effect.  A reduction of the federal &lt;br /&gt;funds rate would mean more, telling investors the Fed’s there to help, cutting the cost of &lt;br /&gt;borrowing and stimulating the economy.  But it wouldn’t do much for banks’ balance &lt;br /&gt;sheets or willingness to lend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s my view that Bernanke would rather not cut rates.  Stimulative action that looked like &lt;br /&gt;an investor bailout would contribute further to moral hazard and the expectation that the &lt;br /&gt;Fed will always protect investors on the downside.  This is an unhealthy expectation, as &lt;br /&gt;each bailout encourages risk taking and thus increases the likelihood that another will be &lt;br /&gt;needed.  But the Fed is being importuned for a rate cut, and there are few people to argue &lt;br /&gt;on the other side, for a good dose of unpleasant medicine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m usually cautious, so I might as well keep my record intact.  The economy should &lt;br /&gt;weaken.  Deals built on optimistic assumptions and paid for with a lot of borrowed &lt;br /&gt;money shouldn’t all thrive.  Generous capital markets should not be expected to bail out &lt;br /&gt;ailing companies.  Bargain hunters and distressed debt investors will have more to do.  &lt;br /&gt;Eventually.  But no one at Oaktree would advise you to act as if these views are sure to &lt;br /&gt;be correct.  We certainly won’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*     *     * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TAn observation I made last October regarding the meltdown of Amaranth, in “Pigweed,” &lt;br /&gt;is equally applicable to the recent problems: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TOrin [Kramer] notes that Amaranth “occurred when the skies were blue; &lt;br /&gt;the fund unraveled because a small and volatile commodity behaved in an &lt;br /&gt;unpredicted fashion.”  This collapse didn’t require an adverse economic &lt;br /&gt;environment or a market crash.  The combination of arrogance, failure to &lt;br /&gt;understand and allow for risk, and a small adverse development can be &lt;br /&gt;enough to wreak havoc.  It can happen to anyone who doesn’t spend &lt;br /&gt;the time and effort required to understand the processes underlying &lt;br /&gt;his portfolio. &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the magnitude of this summer’s crisis has been out of proportion to its &lt;br /&gt;underlying fundamental cause: the increase in subprime delinquencies.  Instead, a &lt;br /&gt;standard combination has proved perfectly incendiary: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; underlying greed, &lt;br /&gt; good returns in the up-leg of the cycle, &lt;br /&gt; euphoria and complacency, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; a free-and-easy credit market, &lt;br /&gt; Wall Street’s inventiveness and salesmanship, and &lt;br /&gt; investors’ naiveté. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This formula often results in crushing losses.  Or as Marc Faber put it, a surplus of &lt;br /&gt;cash leads to a shortage of sense.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An obscure economist named Hyman Minsky is having his fifteen minutes of fame in the &lt;br /&gt;current environment.  Here’s how The Wall Street Journal summarized his views on &lt;br /&gt;August 18: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When times are good, investors take on risk; the longer those times stay &lt;br /&gt;good, the more risk they take on, until they’ve taken on too much.  &lt;br /&gt;Eventually they reach a point where the cash generated by their assets no &lt;br /&gt;longer is sufficient to pay off the mountains of debt they took on to &lt;br /&gt;acquire them.  Losses on such speculative assets prompt lenders to call in &lt;br /&gt;their loans.  "This is likely to lead to a collapse of asset values,” Mr. &lt;br /&gt;Minsky wrote.  When investors are forced to sell even their less-&lt;br /&gt;speculative positions to make good on their loans, markets spiral lower &lt;br /&gt;and create a severe demand for cash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The foregoing aptly describes the current cycle. . . and, I think, the way things always are.  &lt;br /&gt;It certainly seems inevitable that, eventually, investment merit becomes overpriced, and &lt;br /&gt;the combination of good results and easy money causes dangerous leverage to be &lt;br /&gt;employed in the pursuit of profit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When will market cycles be banished or made more muted?  That’ll happen when &lt;br /&gt;greed, human failings and herd behavior are eliminated.  Or, in other words, never.  &lt;br /&gt;In “You Can’t Predict.  You Can Prepare.” I wrote of cycles that success carries within &lt;br /&gt;itself the seeds of failure, and failure carries the seeds of success.  It’ll always be so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;September 10, 2007 &lt;br /&gt;2007 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Limits to Negativism &lt;br /&gt;The markets acted on Monday as if the credit crisis is behind us – how incredible it &lt;br /&gt;is to be able to even write those words, whether true or not.  Whichever is the case, &lt;br /&gt;however, it’s important to reflect on what can be learned from the recent events.  (I &lt;br /&gt;developed these thoughts last week but just wasn’t quick enough to turn them into a &lt;br /&gt;memo.  So I’m reduced to discussing what we all hope is history rather than displaying &lt;br /&gt;foresight.) &lt;br /&gt;UThe Swing of Psychology &lt;br /&gt;The last few weeks witnessed the greatest panic I’ve ever seen, as measured by its &lt;br /&gt;severity, the range of assets affected, its worldwide scope and the negativity of the &lt;br /&gt;accompanying tales of doom.  I’ve been through market crashes before, but none &lt;br /&gt;attributed to the coming collapse of the world financial system. &lt;br /&gt;It’s worth noting that few of the recent sharp price declines were associated with &lt;br /&gt;w&lt;br /&gt;eakness in the depreciating assets or the companies behind them.  Rather, they &lt;br /&gt;were the result of market conditions brought on by psychology, technical &lt;br /&gt;developments and their interconnection.  The worst of them reflected a spiral of &lt;br /&gt;declining security prices, mark-to-market tests, capital inadequacy, margin calls, forced &lt;br /&gt;selling and failures.   &lt;br /&gt;It was readily apparent that such a spiral was underway, and no one could see how or &lt;br /&gt;when it might end.  That was really the problem: no scenario was too negative to be &lt;br /&gt;credible, and any scenario incorporating an element of optimism was dismissed as &lt;br /&gt;Pollyannaish. &lt;br /&gt;There was an element of truth in this, of course: nothing was impossible.  But in dealing &lt;br /&gt;with the future, we must think abou&lt;br /&gt;t two things: (a) what might happen and (b) the &lt;br /&gt;probability it will happen.  &lt;br /&gt;During the crisis, lots of bad things seemed possible, but that didn’t mean they were &lt;br /&gt;going to happen.  In times of crisis, people fail to make that distinction.  Since we &lt;br /&gt;never know much about what the future holds – and in a crisis, with careening causes and &lt;br /&gt;consequences, certainly less than ever – we must decide which side of the debate is more &lt;br /&gt;likely to be profitable (or less likely to be wrong). &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For forty years I’ve seen the manic-depressive cycle of investor psychology swing &lt;br /&gt;crazily: between fear and greed – we all know the refrain – but also between optimism &lt;br /&gt;and pessimism, and between credulity and skepticism.  In general, following the beliefs &lt;br /&gt;of the herd – and swinging with the p&lt;br /&gt;endulum – will give you average performance in the &lt;br /&gt;long run and can get you killed at the extremes.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two or three years ago, the world was so different as to be almost beyond remembering.   &lt;br /&gt;It was ruled by greed, optimism and credulity.  In short, it was the opposite of the last &lt;br /&gt;few weeks: no story was too positive to be believed.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; “There’s a worldwide ‘wall of liquidity’ that can never dry up.”   &lt;br /&gt; “Triple-A CDOs are as safe as triple-A corporate debt but will deliver higher returns.”   &lt;br /&gt; “Leverage holds the key to better investment results.” &lt;br /&gt; “Tranching and selling onward are spreading the risk, thereby eliminating it.”   &lt;br /&gt; “Decoupling has reduced nations’ economic reliance on the U.S.”   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Boy, what a good time that was for a dose of skepticism!  What benefits it could have &lt;br /&gt;provided (in terms of losses avoided).  But when conventional wisdom is rosy, few can &lt;br /&gt;stand against it.  People who do so too early look woefully wrong and are swept aside.  &lt;br /&gt;That discourages others from trying the same thing, even as the cycle swings further to &lt;br /&gt;the positive extreme. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Black Swan &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You may recall that in “The Aviary” in May, I wrote about The Black Swan, the second &lt;br /&gt;book from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of Fooled by Randomness.  In The Black &lt;br /&gt;Swan, Taleb talks about unlikely, extreme, unpredictable events that have the potential &lt;br /&gt;for dramatic impact.  His title was derived from the fact that, never having traveled to &lt;br /&gt;Australia and seen its black swans, Europeans of a few centuries ago were convinced all &lt;br /&gt;swans were white.  In other words, because they’d never seen something, they considered &lt;br /&gt;it impossible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The message of The Black Swan is how important it is to realize that the things &lt;br /&gt;everyone rules out can still come to pass.  That might be generalized into an &lt;br /&gt;understanding of the importance of skepticism. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d define skepticism as not believing what you’re told or what “everyone” considers &lt;br /&gt;true.  In my opinion, it’s one of the most important requirements for successful &lt;br /&gt;investing.  If you believe the story everyone else believes, you’ll do what they do.  &lt;br /&gt;Usually you’ll buy at high prices and sell at lows.  You’ll fall for tales of the “silver &lt;br /&gt;bullet” capable of delivering high returns without risk.  You’ll buy what’s been doing &lt;br /&gt;well and sell what’s been doing poorly.  And you’ll suffer losses in crashes and miss out &lt;br /&gt;when things recover from bottoms.  In other words, you’ll be a conformist, not a &lt;br /&gt;maverick (an overused word these days); a follower, not a contrarian. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism is what it takes to look behind a balance sheet, the latest miracle of financial &lt;br /&gt;engineering or the can’t-miss story.  The idea being marketed by an investment banker or &lt;br /&gt;broker has been prettied up for presentation.  And usually it’s been doing well, making &lt;br /&gt;the tale mo&lt;br /&gt;re credible.  Only a skeptic can separate the things that sound good and &lt;br /&gt;are from the things that sound good and aren’t.  The best investors I know exemplify &lt;br /&gt;this trait.  It’s an absolute necessity. &lt;br /&gt;UThe White Swan &lt;br /&gt;Most people probably took away from The Black Swan the same lessons I did (and the &lt;br /&gt;lessons mentioned in “The Aviary”): “unlikely” isn’t the same as “impossible,” and it’s &lt;br /&gt;essential for investors to be able to get through the low spots. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, it’s improbable events that brought on the credit crisis.  Lots of bad things &lt;br /&gt;happened that had been considered unlikely (if not impossible), and they happened at the &lt;br /&gt;same time, to investors who’d taken on significant leverage.  So the easy explanation is &lt;br /&gt;that the peo&lt;br /&gt;ple who were hurt in the credit crisis hadn’t been skeptical – or pessimistic – &lt;br /&gt;enough.   &lt;br /&gt;But that triggered an epiphany:  &lt;br /&gt;USkepticism and pessimism aren’t synonymous.  &lt;br /&gt;Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive.  But it also calls for &lt;br /&gt;optimism when pessimism is excessiveU.  I’ll write some more on the subject, but it’s &lt;br /&gt;really as simple as that. &lt;br /&gt;Contrarianism – doing the opposite of what others do, or “leaning against the wind” – is &lt;br /&gt;essential for investment success.  But as the credit crisis reached a peak last week, people &lt;br /&gt;succumbed to the wind rather than resisting.  I found very few who were&lt;br /&gt; optimistic; &lt;br /&gt;most were pessimistic to some degree.  Some became genuinely depressed – even a few &lt;br /&gt;great investors I know.  Increasingly negative tales of the coming meltdown were &lt;br /&gt;exchanged via email.  No one applied skepticism, or said “that horror story’s unlikely to &lt;br /&gt;be true.”  Pessimism fed on itself.  People’s only concern was bullet-proofing their &lt;br /&gt;portfolios to get through the coming collapse, or raising enough cash to meet &lt;br /&gt;redemptions.  The one thing they weren’t doing last week was making aggressive bids for &lt;br /&gt;securities.  So prices fell and fell – the old expression is “gapped down” – several points &lt;br /&gt;at a time. &lt;br /&gt;The key – as usual – was to become skeptical of what “everyone” was saying and &lt;br /&gt;doing.  One might have said, “Sure, the negative story may turn out to be true, but &lt;br /&gt;certainly it’s priced into the market.  So there’s little to be gained from betting on it.  On &lt;br /&gt;the other hand, if it turns out not to be true, the appreciation from today’s depressed &lt;br /&gt;levels will be enormous.  I buy!”  The negative story may have looked compelling, but &lt;br /&gt;it’s the positive story – which few believed – that held, and still holds, the greater &lt;br /&gt;potential for profit. &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UThe Future &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I write a lot to dissect and explain past events, but I’ll try here to make a contribution by &lt;br /&gt;taking the riskier path of talking about the future.  What do I see? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the short term, it’s been amply demonstrated that governments and central &lt;br /&gt;banks will do everything they can to resolve the credit crisis.  No stone will go &lt;br /&gt;unturned, and few options will be declined.  Most people now believe that letting Lehman &lt;br /&gt;Brothers go was a big mistake: as a result of a calculated decision, discipline took &lt;br /&gt;precedence over rescue.  The results were disastrous, as the commercial paper market &lt;br /&gt;froze up, money market funds “broke the buck,” and the crisis was ratcheted up several &lt;br /&gt;notches. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most people don’t repeat their mistakes; they make new ones.  So we should expect that &lt;br /&gt;all key players will be rescued in the period ahead.  Some elements of that effort will be &lt;br /&gt;mistakes, but at least those mistakes won’t pull down the financial system.  Morgan &lt;br /&gt;Stanley was the next big worry but, after Lehman, it became unlikely that Morgan would &lt;br /&gt;be allowed to fail.  I was asked, “Will the U.S. government guarantee a capital &lt;br /&gt;investment made by a Japanese institution?”  Absolutely, if that’s what it takes.  It beats &lt;br /&gt;the U.S. having to put up its own money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sums being thrown around are the biggest ever: hundreds of billions, adding up &lt;br /&gt;to trillions.  But there’s no hesitation: everything will be done.  That doesn’t mean it &lt;br /&gt;has to work, but it’s likely to.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Walter Wriston led Citibank from 1967 to 1984, all but my final year there.  He was the &lt;br /&gt;world’s leading banker and a great guy.  One of his most famous observations was, &lt;br /&gt;“countries don’t go bust.”  I assume he was making reference to their ownership of &lt;br /&gt;printing presses, and thus their unlimited ability to pay their local-currency obligations.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s the main reason why we shouldn’t expect there to be any limit on the resources &lt;br /&gt;thrown at the problem.  All it will take is running the printing presses long enough to &lt;br /&gt;rebuild financial institutions’ capital accounts, make good guarantees and enable &lt;br /&gt;borrowers to roll over their outstanding debt, all of which is reckoned in nominal terms.  &lt;br /&gt;The philosophical bridge of unlimited aid to private institutions appears to have &lt;br /&gt;been crossed, and printing the necessary money is unlikely to be an issue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods.  Creating money isn’t the end of &lt;br /&gt;the story.  What will be the effect? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, the people who have money have to make the decision to lend to those who need it &lt;br /&gt;to fund their businesses.  The Fed’s provision of capital to financial institutions – even at &lt;br /&gt;ultra-low interest rates – isn’t enough.  If banks borrow money cheaply and lend it to &lt;br /&gt;people who don’t repay them, they’ll be out a lot of low-cost capital.  And if they’re on &lt;br /&gt;the hook for repaying the Fed, they’ll be way behind.  Because of residual conservatism, &lt;br /&gt;the steps so far might have the ineffectiveness of “pushing on a string,” something I &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mentioned in “Now What?” in January.  We still have to see money begin to circulate &lt;br /&gt;throughout the system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jim Grant, the crea&lt;br /&gt;tor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, uses a great phrase to &lt;br /&gt;describe liquidity and credit: “money of the mind.”  Unlike actual currency, it &lt;br /&gt;grows and shrinks depending on people’s moods – we’ve just seen a great &lt;br /&gt;demonstration.  So it’s not enough for the Fed to give money to financial institutions; &lt;br /&gt;they have to be convinced to provide liquidity and credit.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In recent times, the Fed has provided a lot of capital to banks, but it has also taken in a lot &lt;br /&gt;of deposits from banks.  We want to see the Fed’s advance reloaned, not put on deposit.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s what it’ll take to restart the credit machine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even when credit starts flowing again, however, I doubt things will return immediately to &lt;br /&gt;their old pace.  Losses have been taken and capital destroyed, and more losses may still &lt;br /&gt;be incoming (ask yourself if home prices are finished going down).  More importantly, &lt;br /&gt;psyches have been damaged: consumer psychology, lenders’ willingness, even investor &lt;br /&gt;confidence – all have taken a beating.  I doubt if things will bounce right back.  There just &lt;br /&gt;won’t be the same expansiveness.  I’ll stick with what I said in “Now What?” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly, credit will be harder to obtain.  Economic growth will slow: &lt;br /&gt;the question is whether it will remain slightly positive or go negative, &lt;br /&gt;satisfying the requirement for the label “recession.”  Regardless, positive &lt;br /&gt;thinking and thus risk taking are likely to be diminished.  All I can say for &lt;br /&gt;sure is that the world will be less rosy in financial terms, and results are &lt;br /&gt;likely to be less positive than they otherwise would have been.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UAwash in Money &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the longer term, we have to wonder about the effect on the world of a glut of &lt;br /&gt;newly printed dollars, sterling and euros.  The reason owning printing presses makes &lt;br /&gt;repayment easy is that it lets a nation cheapen its currency.  But one would think that &lt;br /&gt;more units of currency per unit of GDP means a debasement of the currency, and thus &lt;br /&gt;reduced purchasing power (read: higher inflation).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Walking along Hyde Park on Sunday, I saw a street vendor selling old stock certificates.  &lt;br /&gt;Do you have any banknotes, I asked?  Anything from the Weimar Republic?  For the last &lt;br /&gt;few weeks, I’ve wanted to get some of those. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Weimar Germany, the government enabled itself to pay World War I reparations by &lt;br /&gt;cheapening its currency . . . literally.  So the 1,000 mark note I bought was simply over-&lt;br /&gt;stamped One Million Marks in red.  Voila!  Now we’re all rich.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mark fell from 60 to the U.S. dollar in early 1921 to 320 to the dollar in early 1922 &lt;br /&gt;and 8,000 to the dollar by the end of 1922.  It’s hard to believe, but according to &lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia (user-maintained and perhaps not always the most authoritative): &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 Marks to 1 &lt;br /&gt;U.S. dollar.  In 1923, the rate of inflation hit 3.25 x 10&lt;br /&gt;P&lt;br /&gt;6&lt;br /&gt;P percent per month &lt;br /&gt;(prices double every two days).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the firms printing these [new 100 trillion Mark] notes submitted an &lt;br /&gt;invoice for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 (3.28 x 10&lt;br /&gt;P&lt;br /&gt;19&lt;br /&gt;P, or 33 quintillion) &lt;br /&gt;Marks.  [That’s not a misprint.] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lord Keynes judged the situation this way:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to &lt;br /&gt;extraordinary lengths.  The various belligerent governments, unable, or too &lt;br /&gt;timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the resources they &lt;br /&gt;required, have printed notes for the balance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s not that easy.  People with things to sell aren’t that stupid.  So instead of 1,000 &lt;br /&gt;marks, a goat now costs one million marks.  That piece of paper used to be a thousand &lt;br /&gt;mark note – and now it’s a million mark note – but it still buys the same goat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The benefit to the government is that it’s able to pay off its old nominal debts in currency &lt;br /&gt;of which it suddenly has a lot more . . . but which no longer has much purchasing power.  &lt;br /&gt;So when repaid in the cheapened currency in 1923, the person to whom the government &lt;br /&gt;owed 1,000 marks can only buy one-thousandth of a goat – not a whole goat as in 1920. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My late friend Henry Reichmann was a boy then, working as a busboy in a restaurant in &lt;br /&gt;Berlin.  He told me he used to be paid at lunchtime and immediately ran out to spend his &lt;br /&gt;salary, since it would buy less if he waited until after work to shop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s hyperinflation.  Just as the Great Depression became a model during the credit &lt;br /&gt;crisis, Weimar Germany gives us something to think about regarding our new future.  &lt;br /&gt;I’m not smart enough to know what’s coming, but I’m also not dumb enough to &lt;br /&gt;think a few government actions on Monday were enough to solve all our problems.  &lt;br /&gt;At best, we usually substitute one problem for another – usually one later on in lieu of &lt;br /&gt;today’s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what to do about this risk, whether it’ll come home to roost, or to what &lt;br /&gt;extent.  And I certainly don’t think hyperinflation can be assigned a high enough &lt;br /&gt;probability to make it worth doing much about.  But it may cause one to rethink holdings &lt;br /&gt;of low-yielding, flight-to-quality-elevated, long-term Treasurys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UThe New Financial Order &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My daughter Jane – the artistic member of the family – has developed a strong interest in &lt;br /&gt;politics and economics of late.  (I think this is happening to young people all across the &lt;br /&gt;U.S., and it’s a very favorable development.)  On Saturday she called to ask what I &lt;br /&gt;thought about government ownership of banks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, I said, I thought it could make an important contribution to solving the short-term &lt;br /&gt;problem, and that’s good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, however, the U.S. has a strong tradition of government non-involvement in &lt;br /&gt;business, and we’d probably like to see it stay that way.  “Nationalization” is a much &lt;br /&gt;dirtier word in America than in most other places (International Herald Tribune headline, &lt;br /&gt;October 14 – “Nationalization rule: Do it, but don’t say it”).  My preference, I told Jane, &lt;br /&gt;is for free enterprise with some adult supervision.  When we make fundamental changes &lt;br /&gt;in the system, it’s hard to foresee all the consequences.  Consider these questions: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Will legislators push bankers to make more loans to their constituents (remember &lt;br /&gt;Fannie and Freddie)? &lt;br /&gt; Will the banks have to lend to everyone, even weak borrowers?  Will they be allowed &lt;br /&gt;to reject any applicants? &lt;br /&gt; Will they be prevented from foreclosing when mortgages are unpaid? &lt;br /&gt; Will they be deterred from financing “anti-social” investments like leveraged &lt;br /&gt;buyouts? &lt;br /&gt; Will they be limited in compensating executives?  Will that make them less attractive &lt;br /&gt;as employers? &lt;br /&gt; Will bank employees worry about being penalized for errors of commission but not &lt;br /&gt;errors of omission?   &lt;br /&gt; If so, will banks be staffed by people who are overly risk-averse?  Will they lean &lt;br /&gt;toward saying “no”? &lt;br /&gt; Will capital be harder to come by, especially for smaller, younger companies?   &lt;br /&gt; Will economic growth be slower than it otherwise would have been? &lt;br /&gt; Will non-government-owned banks be at a disadvantage because, as weaker credits, &lt;br /&gt;they’ll have to pay more than the competition for their capital? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one knows, but these questions deserve consideration.  Here’s the underlying &lt;br /&gt;question: if the government’s equity is non-voting, will that be enough to keep it out &lt;br /&gt;of the banks’ affairs?  It’s far too soon to say (and hard to be completely optimistic). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I continue to believe the financial sector of the future will be less leveraged, less risk-&lt;br /&gt;prone, less profitable, slower growing and more regulated.  And that’ll make it less &lt;br /&gt;exciting, less glamorous and less the employer of choice.  But the beauty of the free-&lt;br /&gt;market system is that most developments entail plusses as well as minuses.  I’ve believed &lt;br /&gt;for many years that just as success carries within itself the seeds of failure (see 2003-&lt;br /&gt;08), so does failure carry the seeds of success. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the banks are made more bureaucratic and risk-averse – and less aggressive and &lt;br /&gt;competitive – I’m sure independent boutiques will arise and prosper.  The model I have &lt;br /&gt;in mind is a forest fire: a year after, bright green shoots grow from the ashes; in fact, I &lt;br /&gt;think th&lt;br /&gt;ey’re fertilized by the ashes.  Think what a landscape like that means for advisory &lt;br /&gt;firms like Moelis, Evercore, Gleacher and Greenhill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a free-market environment, not even a good knock can keep aggressive people &lt;br /&gt;from responding to opportunities.  The financial sector will look very different in &lt;br /&gt;ten years from what it was a year ago – and that won’t be all bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find that I often end with a quote from Warren Buffett, and often it’s the same one: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the &lt;br /&gt;prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now I want to talk about the flip side:  When others conduct their affairs with &lt;br /&gt;excessive negativism, it’s worth being positive.  When others love ‘em, we should hate &lt;br /&gt;‘em.  But when others hate ‘em, we can love ‘em. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In “The Tide Goes Out” in March, I listed the stages of both bull and bear markets.  I said &lt;br /&gt;that in the terminal third stage of a bull market, everyone is convinced things will get &lt;br /&gt;better forever.  The folly of joining that consensus is obvious; people who invest thinking &lt;br /&gt;there’ll never be anything to worry about are sure to get hurt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the third stage of a bear market, on the other hand, everyone agrees things can only get &lt;br /&gt;worse.  The risk in that – in terms of opportunity costs, or forgone profits – is equally &lt;br /&gt;clear.  There’s no doubt in my mind that the bear market reached the third stage &lt;br /&gt;last week.  That doesn’t mean it can’t decline further, or that a bull market’s about &lt;br /&gt;to start.  But it does mean the negatives are on the table, optimism is thoroughly &lt;br /&gt;lacking, and the greater long-term risk probably lies in not investing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The excesses, mistakes and foolishness of the 2003-2007 upward leg of the cycle were &lt;br /&gt;the greatest I’ve ever witnessed.  So has been the resulting panic.  The damage that’s &lt;br /&gt;been done to security prices may be enough to correct for those excesses – or too much or &lt;br /&gt;too little.  But certainly it’s a good time to pick among the rubble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank my Oaktree colleagues for &lt;br /&gt;their ongoing steadfastness.  There’s a simple formula for taking maximum advantage &lt;br /&gt;of opportunities in a collapsing ma&lt;br /&gt;rket: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(a) have a firm, well-reasoned estimate of an asset’s intrinsic value; &lt;br /&gt;(b) recognize when the asset’s price falls below its value, and buy; &lt;br /&gt;(c) average down if the price goes lower; and &lt;br /&gt;(d) be right about the value. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Acumen and resolve are both essential.  My colleagues continue to show both.  In recent &lt;br /&gt;weeks our list of purchases has been long most days, and our list of sales almost non-&lt;br /&gt;existent.  Where there’s cash we’ve put a lot to work, averaging down aggressively, in &lt;br /&gt;what we think are great buys.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also want to thank our clients for trusting us and sticking with us.  As Bruce Karsh &lt;br /&gt;and I wrote ten days ago in a memo to investors in our Opportunities Funds for &lt;br /&gt;distressed debt, “. . . in a few years we’ll reminisce together about how easy it was to &lt;br /&gt;take advantage of the bargains of 2008-09.”  Whether or not the worst of the crisis is &lt;br /&gt;now truly behind us, I continue to feel that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;October 15, 2008 &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Volatility + Leverage = Dynamite &lt;br /&gt;Nearly fifteen years ago, in April 1994 – at a time when absolutely no one was reading &lt;br /&gt;my memos – I published one called “Risk in Today’s Markets Revisited.”  That’s when I &lt;br /&gt;first proposed the formula shown above.  I recycled it in “Genius Isn’t Enough,” on the &lt;br /&gt;subject of Long-Term Capital Management (October 1998). &lt;br /&gt;The last few years have provided a great demonstration of how dangerous it can be to &lt;br /&gt;combine leverage with risky assets, and that’s the subject of this memo.  I&lt;br /&gt;t’ll also pick up &lt;br /&gt;on some ideas from my last memo, “The Limits to Negativism.” &lt;br /&gt;My memo “Plan B” on the bailout proposal went out on September 24, and as I lay in bed &lt;br /&gt;later that night, I realized that I hadn’t taken one part of it nearly far enough.  In &lt;br /&gt;discussing a prime cause of the credit crisis, I wrote the following: &lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep it simple.  Suppose you have $1 million in equity capital.  You &lt;br /&gt;borrow $29 million and buy $30 million of mortgage loans.  Twenty &lt;br /&gt;percent (or $6 million) of the mortgages go into default, and the recovery &lt;br /&gt;on them turns out to be only two-thirds ($4 million).  Thus you’ve lost $2 &lt;br /&gt;million . . . your equity capital twice over.  Now you have equity capital of &lt;br /&gt;minus $1 million, with assets of $28 million and debt of $29 million.  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone realizes that there’ll be nothing left for the people who’re last in &lt;br /&gt;line to withdraw their money, so there’s a run on the bank.  And you slide &lt;br /&gt;into bankruptcy. &lt;br /&gt;That’s true as far as it goes, but I’m going to devote this memo to things which could &lt;br /&gt;have followed that paragraph.     &lt;br /&gt;UThe Problem at Financial Institutions &lt;br /&gt;It’s no coincidence that today’s financial crisis was kicked off at highly leveraged &lt;br /&gt;banks and investment banks.  The paragraph above shows why that’s true, and why the &lt;br /&gt;problem is as big as it is.  As I wrote in “Plan B”: &lt;br /&gt;Because of the high regard in which financial institutions were held; &lt;br /&gt;because of the implied government backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie &lt;br /&gt;Mac; and because permissible leverage increased over time, financial &lt;br /&gt;institutions’ equity capital was permitted to become highly inadequate &lt;br /&gt;given the riskiness of the assets they held.  Or perhaps I should say &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;institutions took on too many risky assets given the limitations of their &lt;br /&gt;equity capital.  That, in a nutshell, is why institutions have disappeared. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what exactly did these institutions do wrong?  Here are a few examples, using Bank &lt;br /&gt;X, with $10 billion of capital, to illustrate: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bank X uses leverage to buy $100 billion of triple-A mortgage-related debt, under the &lt;br /&gt;assumption that it can’t lose mo&lt;br /&gt;re than 1%.  Instead, home prices decline nationwide, &lt;br /&gt;causing it to write down its holdings by 10%, or $10 billion.  Its capital is gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Alternatively (but in fact probably simultaneously), Bank X sells Hedge Fund G $10 &lt;br /&gt;billion of credit default swaps on the bonds of Company A, and it buys $10 billion of &lt;br /&gt;the same credit protection from Investment Bank H.  Company A goes bankrupt, and &lt;br /&gt;Bank X pays Hedge Fund G $10 billion.  But Investment Bank H goes bankrupt, too, &lt;br /&gt;so Bank X can’t collect the $10 billion it’s due.  Its capital is gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bank X lends $50 billion to Hedge Fund P with equity of $10 billion, which then &lt;br /&gt;buys $60 billion of securities.  The value of the fund’s portfolio falls to $50 billion; &lt;br /&gt;the bank sends a margin call; no additional collateral can be posted; so the bank &lt;br /&gt;seizes and sells out the portfolio.  But in the downward-spiraling market, the bank &lt;br /&gt;only realizes $40 billion.  Its capital is gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hedge Fund Q also borrowed to buy securities.  When Hedge Fund P got its margin &lt;br /&gt;call and its portfolio was sold out, that forced securities prices downward.  So Fund Q &lt;br /&gt;– which holds many of the same positions – also receives a margin call, perpetuating &lt;br /&gt;the downward spiral and bringing more losses to more institutions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of these scenarios, and many others, are connected by a common thread: the &lt;br /&gt;combination of leverage and illusory safety, which allowed institutions to take on too &lt;br /&gt;much risk for the amount of capital they had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, it should be clear from the above that the amount of borrowed money – &lt;br /&gt;leverage – that it’s prudent to use is purely a function of the riskiness and volatility &lt;br /&gt;of the assets it’s used to purchase.  The more stable the assets, the more leverage it’s &lt;br /&gt;safe to use.  Riskier assets, less leverage.  It’s that simple. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons for the problem today at financial institutions is that they &lt;br /&gt;underestimated the risk inherent in assets such as home mortgages and, as a result, &lt;br /&gt;bought too much mortgage-backed paper with too much borrowed money.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let’s go back to the paragraph on page one.  Here it is again: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep it simple.  Suppose you have $1 million in equity capital.  You &lt;br /&gt;borrow $29 million and buy $30 million of mortgage loans.  Twenty &lt;br /&gt;percent (or $6 million) of the mortgages go into default, and the recovery &lt;br /&gt;on them turns out to be only two-thirds ($4 million).  Thus you’ve lost $2 &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;million . . . your equity capital twice over.  Now you have equity capital of &lt;br /&gt;minus $1 million, with assets of $28 million and debt of $29 million.  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone realizes that there’ll be nothing left for the people who’re last in &lt;br /&gt;line to withdraw their money, so there’s a run on the bank.  And you slide &lt;br /&gt;into bankruptcy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suppose you set up your leveraged portfolio as described but only 2% of&lt;br /&gt; your mortgage &lt;br /&gt;holdings go bad, not 20%.  Then, you only lose $200,000 (not $2 million) of your $1 &lt;br /&gt;million of equity, and you’re still solvent.  Or suppose 20% of your mortgages default as &lt;br /&gt;in the original example, but you only levered up ten times, not 30.  You lose the same &lt;br /&gt;6.7% of your assets, but based on $10 million, so it’s just $670,000, or two-thirds of your &lt;br /&gt;equity.  You’re still alive.  The problem lies entirely in the fact that the institutions &lt;br /&gt;combined highly risky assets with a large amount of leverage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now, everyone recognizes (a) how silly it was for the financial modelers to be so sure &lt;br /&gt;there couldn’t be a nationwide drop in home prices (they felt that way because there &lt;br /&gt;never had been one – but did their data include the Depression?) and (b) the terrible job &lt;br /&gt;the agencies did of rating mortgage-related securities.  So the risk was underestimated, &lt;br /&gt;permitting the leverage to become excessive: end of story.  Reason number one for &lt;br /&gt;today’s problem, then, is the mismatch institutions turned out to have made between &lt;br /&gt;asset risk and leverage.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second reason is that, given the degree by which mortgage defaults have &lt;br /&gt;exceeded expectations, no one feels like taking a chance on how bad things will get.  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone agrees it’ll be bad, but no one can say how bad.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I said in October in “The Limits to Negativism,” when things are going well, no &lt;br /&gt;assumption is too optimistic to be accepted.  But when things turn down, none seems too &lt;br /&gt;pessimistic.  Today, with the ability to lose money on mortgages having been &lt;br /&gt;demonstrated so painfully, investors consider themselves unable to say where the losses &lt;br /&gt;will stop.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if a highly leveraged financial institution has significant mortgage holdings, few &lt;br /&gt;people are willing to risk money in the belief that the losses will be bearable.  If a &lt;br /&gt;financial institution has book equity of $100 million and $500 million of mortgage assets, &lt;br /&gt;no one will grant that future losses will be less than $100 million – that is, that it’ll &lt;br /&gt;remain solvent.  Maybe the writedowns will be $100 million.  Or $300 million.  Or $500 &lt;br /&gt;million.  There’s no assumption too negative.  As a result, investors will just keep their &lt;br /&gt;money in their pockets.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few sovereign wealth funds and others jumped in a year ago, and based on results so &lt;br /&gt;far, it looks like they acted too soon.  In July, Goldman Sachs reported that 52 banks had &lt;br /&gt;raised capital and the providers of that capital were underwater at 50 of them, by an &lt;br /&gt;average of 45%.  Certainly things are much worse now.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are behaving as if there’s no such thing as investing safely in a financial &lt;br /&gt;institution.  This widespread belief has the ability to greatly delay the restoration of &lt;br /&gt;faith, capital and viability.  Peter Bernstein put it succinctly in The New York Times of &lt;br /&gt;September 28.  (Peter’s one of the very wisest men around, in part because he’s one of &lt;br /&gt;the few who can talk about the Depression from experience.  I recommend his op-ed &lt;br /&gt;piece, “What’s Free About Free Enterprise?”) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This time around, assets are evidently so rotten in so many places that no &lt;br /&gt;financial institution wants to risk doing business with any other financial &lt;br /&gt;institution without a government backstop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s the reason why no buyer could be found for Lehman Brothers over the weekend &lt;br /&gt;preceding its bankruptcy.  No one could assess its assets and get comfortable regarding &lt;br /&gt;the status of its highly levered net worth, so everyone required a government backstop . . . &lt;br /&gt;which wasn’t forthcoming.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UThe Right Level of Leverage &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I communicate primarily in words, I tend to think a lot in pictures – certainly &lt;br /&gt;more than in numbers.  My concept of appropriate leverage can easily be demonstrated &lt;br /&gt;through a few diagrams.  I’m going to overlook the differences between accounting &lt;br /&gt;value, market value and economic value and confuse the terms.  But I think you’ll get the &lt;br /&gt;idea. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The drawings below show the value of companies of different types.  Due to the &lt;br /&gt;variability of their earnings, the values fluctuate differently over time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here’s a financial structure, except with the equity above the debt, not below as it would &lt;br /&gt;be on a balance sheet: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s combine the two concepts.  The bottom line is that in order for a comp&lt;br /&gt;any to &lt;br /&gt;avoid insolvency, its financial structure has to be such that its value won’t fall through the &lt;br /&gt;equity and into the debt.  In naïve and far-from-technically correct terms, when the &lt;br /&gt;amount of debt exceeds the value of the company, it’s insolvent, as suggested below. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What the following doodles illustrate is that for every level of riskiness and volatility, &lt;br /&gt;there’s an appropriate limit on leverage in the capital structure.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first leveraged buyout boom in the late 1970s and the 1980s, it was a &lt;br /&gt;watchword that they should be done only with stable companies.  But in bullish &lt;br /&gt;times, rules like that are forgotten or ignored, and we get buyouts of companies in &lt;br /&gt;cyclical industries like semiconductors or autos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Extrem&lt;br /&gt;ely leveraged companies have existed for more than a century.  They’re called &lt;br /&gt;utilities.  Because their profits are regulated by public commissions and fixed as a &lt;br /&gt;percentage of their stable asset bases, they’ve been extremely dependable.  This shows &lt;br /&gt;that high leverage isn’t necessarily risky, just the wrong level of leverage given the &lt;br /&gt;company’s stability. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It can be safe for life insurance companies to take risk on limited capital, because their &lt;br /&gt;operations are steady and their risks can be anticipated.  They know everyone will die, &lt;br /&gt;and roughly when (on average).  But if a firm like MBIA was going to guarantee &lt;br /&gt;mortgage securities, it should have recognized their instability and unpredictability and &lt;br /&gt;limited its leverage.  The insurance industry’s way of saying that is that its capital should &lt;br /&gt;have been higher as a percentage of the risks assumed.  MBIA insured $75 billion of &lt;br /&gt;residential and commercial mortgage paper on the basis of total capital – not capital &lt;br /&gt;devoted to its insuring mortgage securities, but total capital – of only $3 billion.  Did &lt;br /&gt;anyone worry about the possibility that 5% of the mortgages would default?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leverage is always seductive.  If you have $1 million of capital and write $25 million of &lt;br /&gt;insurance at a 1% annual premium, you bring in $250,000 of premiums, for a 25% return &lt;br /&gt;on capital (before losses and expenses).  But why not write $50 million of insurance and &lt;br /&gt;bring in $500,000?  The answer is that policy losses might exceed 2% of the insurance &lt;br /&gt;written, in which case your losses would be greater than the capital you have to pay them &lt;br /&gt;with . . . and you might be insolvent.  But in order to resist using maximum available &lt;br /&gt;leverage, you need discipline and an appreciation for the risks involved.  In recent &lt;br /&gt;years, few firms had both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UWhy Mortgages? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why is it residential mortgage-related paper that set off the process endangering our &lt;br /&gt;institutions?  Why not high yield bonds or leveraged loans or even equities?  One reason, &lt;br /&gt;of course, is the sheer size of the residential mortgage-related securities market: $11 &lt;br /&gt;trillion.  But there are two others. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first is the inability to value the underlying collateral.  I feel comfortable when &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree’s analysts value the debt or equity of a cash-flow-producing company.  To the &lt;br /&gt;extent an asset produces a stream of cash flows, and assuming they’re somewhat &lt;br /&gt;predictable, the asset can reasonably be valued.  But assets that don’t produce cash flows &lt;br /&gt;can’t be valued as readily (this has been a regular theme of mine of late). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s a barrel of oil worth?  $33 in January 2004, $147 in mid-2008, or $42 earlier this &lt;br /&gt;month?  Which price was “right”?  All of them?  Or none of them?  We all know about &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the things that will influence the price of oil, such as finite supply, growing demand, and &lt;br /&gt;the unreliability of some of the producing nations.  But what do those factors make it &lt;br /&gt;worth?&lt;br /&gt;  No one can convert these intangibles into a fair price.  That’s why, a few &lt;br /&gt;months ago at $147, we were seeing predictions of $200 oil.  And now, with the price &lt;br /&gt;down two-thirds, there’s talk of $25. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The same is true of commodities, gold, currencies, art and diamonds.  And houses.  &lt;br /&gt;What’s a house worth?  What it cost to build?  What it would cost to replace today?  &lt;br /&gt;What it last sold for?  What the one next door sold for?  The amount that was &lt;br /&gt;borrowed against it?  (Certainly not.)  Some multiple of what it could be rented for?  &lt;br /&gt;What about when there are no renters?  The answer is “none of these.”  On a given &lt;br /&gt;day, houses – and all of the things listed just above – are worth only what someone &lt;br /&gt;will pay for them.  Well, that’s true in the short run for corporate securities, too, as &lt;br /&gt;we’ve seen in the last few months.  But in the long run, you can expect security prices to &lt;br /&gt;gravitate toward the discounted present value of their future cash flows.  There’s no such &lt;br /&gt;lodestone for houses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Think about one of the biggest jokes, the home appraisal.  If a house doesn’t have a &lt;br /&gt;“value,” what do mortgage appraisers do?  They research recent sales of similar houses &lt;br /&gt;nearby and apply those values on a per-square-foot basis.  But such an appraisal &lt;br /&gt;obviously says nothing about what a house will bring after being repossessed a few years &lt;br /&gt;later.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, in recent years, a purchase price of $X, supported by an appraisal of $X, &lt;br /&gt;was used to justify lending 95% of $X – or maybe 100% or 105% – when a home was &lt;br /&gt;bought or refinanced.  No wonder homes valued in the biggest boom in history have &lt;br /&gt;turned out to be unreliable collateral. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, these overrated mortgages were packaged into the most alchemical and &lt;br /&gt;fantastic leveraged structures.  It is these, not mortgages themselves, that have &lt;br /&gt;jeopardized our institutions.  There was a limited market for whole mortgage loans; &lt;br /&gt;they were considered a specialist market entailing risk and requiring expertise.  But &lt;br /&gt;supposedly those worries would be obviated if one bought the debt of structured entities &lt;br /&gt;that invested in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First question: where did the risk go?  We were told it disappeared thanks to the magic of &lt;br /&gt;structuring, tranching and diversifying, permitting vast amounts of leverage to be applied &lt;br /&gt;safely.  Second question: how reliable was the diversification?  Answer: again we were &lt;br /&gt;told, highly reliable; there had never been a national decline in home prices, so mortgages &lt;br /&gt;could be considered uncorrelated with each other.  The performance of a mortgage on a &lt;br /&gt;house in Detroit would be unaffected by what went on in Florida or California.  (Well, so &lt;br /&gt;much for what we were told.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The institutions’ writedowns generally are in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), debt &lt;br /&gt;issued by special-purpose entities that borrowed huge amounts relative to their equity in &lt;br /&gt;order to purchase mortgage-related securities.  As described earlier, underestimated risk &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;led to the use of unwise amounts of leverage.  But interestingly, the key losses aren’t in &lt;br /&gt;the riskier junior tranches of CDO debt, about which there was some leeriness.  Rather, &lt;br /&gt;they’re in the triple-A-rated tranches.  It’s to buy those tranches that our leading &lt;br /&gt;institutions took on too much leverage.  Once again, greatly underestimated risk led to &lt;br /&gt;great leverage and thus great losses.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What did you need to steer clear of&lt;br /&gt; CDO debt?  Computers, sophisticated programs &lt;br /&gt;and exceptional analysis?  Genius?  No: skepticism and common sense.  In RMBS, &lt;br /&gt;CDOs and CDO-squareds (entities that borrowed to buy CDO debt), 90% or so of their &lt;br /&gt;capital structure was rated higher than the underlying collateral, all based on the &lt;br /&gt;linchpin assumption that mortgages were uncorrelated.  That’s all you had to know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How good a piece of collateral is a subprime mortgage covering 100% of the &lt;br /&gt;purchase price of a house bought in a soaring market by an applicant who’ll pay a &lt;br /&gt;higher interest rate to be able to skip documenting income or employment?  That’s &lt;br /&gt;not a secured loan; it’s an option on future appreciation.  If the house goes up in price, the &lt;br /&gt;buyer makes the mortgage payments and continues to own it.  If it goes down, the buyer &lt;br /&gt;walks away, in which case the lender gains ownership of a house worth less than the &lt;br /&gt;amount loaned against it.  Thus the viability of the mortgages was entirely dependent on &lt;br /&gt;continued home price appreciation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Given the above, what was the credit quality of subprime mortgages?  I’d say double-B at &lt;br /&gt;best.  (I’d much rather buy even the single-B “junk bonds” of profitable companies that &lt;br /&gt;we’ve held over the last 30 years than this inflated “home option” paper.)  And yet, in a &lt;br /&gt;typical CDO, 80% of the debt was rated triple-A and 97% was rated investment grade &lt;br /&gt;(triple-B or better).  Those high ratings made CDO debt very attractive to financial &lt;br /&gt;institutions that were able to borrow cheaply to buy high-rated assets, satisfying the strict &lt;br /&gt;rules regarding the “quality” of their portfolio holdings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Financial engineers and investment bankers took unreliable collateral and packaged &lt;br /&gt;it into highly leveraged structures supporting debt that was rated high enough to &lt;br /&gt;attract financial institutions.  What a superb example of the imprudent use of &lt;br /&gt;leverage.  And what a simple explanation of how our highly leveraged institutions got &lt;br /&gt;into trouble.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UHow Bad is Bad? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the prime lessons that must be learned from this experience is that in &lt;br /&gt;determining how much leverage to put on, you’d better make generous assumptions &lt;br /&gt;about how risky your assets might turn out to be.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The example in the paragraph on page one demonstrates the role of risk in the equation.  &lt;br /&gt;The more your assets are prone to permanent loss, the less leverage you should employ.  &lt;br /&gt;But it’s also important to recognize the role of volatility.  Even if losses aren’t permanent, &lt;br /&gt;a downward fluctuation can bring risk of ruin if a portfolio is highly leveraged and (a) the &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lenders can cut off credit, (b) investors can be frightened into withdrawing their equity, or &lt;br /&gt;(c) the violation of regulatory or contractual standards can trigger forced selling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is that extreme volatility and loss surface only infrequently.  And as &lt;br /&gt;time passes without that happening, it appears more and more likely that it’ll never &lt;br /&gt;happen – that assumptions regarding risk were too conservative.  Thus it become&lt;br /&gt;s &lt;br /&gt;tempting to relax rules and increase leverage.  And often this is done just before the risk &lt;br /&gt;finally rears its head.  As Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote in Fooled by Randomness: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette.  First, it delivers the fatal &lt;br /&gt;bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even &lt;br /&gt;thousands of chambers instead of six.  After a few dozen tries, one forgets &lt;br /&gt;about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security . . . &lt;br /&gt;Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where &lt;br /&gt;the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, &lt;br /&gt;one does not observe the barrel of reality. . . .  One is thus capable of &lt;br /&gt;unwittingly playing Russian roulette – and calling it by some alter-&lt;br /&gt;native “low risk” name.  (p. 28; emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The financial institutions played a high-risk game thinking it was a low-risk game, &lt;br /&gt;all because their assumptions on losses and volatility were too low.  We’d be &lt;br /&gt;watching an entirely different picture if only they’d said, “This stuff is potentially risky.  &lt;br /&gt;Since home prices have gone up so much and mortgages have been available so easily, &lt;br /&gt;there just might be widespread declines in home prices this time.  So we’re only going to &lt;br /&gt;lever up half as much as past performance might suggest.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to say they should have made more conservative assumptions.  But how &lt;br /&gt;conservative?  You can’t run a business on the basis of worst-case assumptions.  You &lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t be able to do anything.  And anyway, a “worst-case assumption” is really a &lt;br /&gt;misnomer; there’s no such thing, short of a total loss.  Now we know the quants shouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;have assumed there couldn’t be a nationwide decline in home prices.  But once you grant &lt;br /&gt;that such a decline can happen – for the first time – what extent should you prepare for?  &lt;br /&gt;Two percent?  Ten?  Fifty? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite adages concerns the six-foot-tall man who drowned crossing the &lt;br /&gt;stream that was five feet deep on average.  It’s not enough to survive in the investment &lt;br /&gt;world on average; you have to survive every moment.  The unusual turbulence of the last &lt;br /&gt;two years – and especially the last three months – made it possible for that six-foot-tall &lt;br /&gt;man to drown in a stream that was two feet deep on average.  &lt;br /&gt;UShould the possibility of &lt;br /&gt;today’s events have been anticipated?  It’s hard to say it should have been.  And yet, &lt;br /&gt;it’s incumbent upon investors to prepare for adversity.  The juxtaposition of these &lt;br /&gt;sentences introduces an interesting conundrum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these tales from the front lines: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There had never been a national decline in home prices, but now the Case-Shiller &lt;br /&gt;index is down 26% from its peak in July 2006, according to the Financial Times of &lt;br /&gt;November 29. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In my twenty-nine previous years with high yield bonds, including four when more &lt;br /&gt;than 10% of all outstanding bonds defaulted, the index’s worst yearly decline was &lt;br /&gt;7%.  But in 2008, it’s down 30% (even though the last-twelve-months’ default rate is &lt;br /&gt;only about 3%). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Performing bank loans never traded much below par in the past, and holders received &lt;br /&gt;very substantial recoveries on any that defaulted.  Now, even though there have been &lt;br /&gt;few defaults, the price of the average loan is in the 60s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The headlines are full of entities that have seen massive losses, and perhaps meltdowns, &lt;br /&gt;because they bought assets using leverage.  Going back to the diagrams on pages 4-5, &lt;br /&gt;these investors put on leverage that might have been appropriate with moderate-volatility &lt;br /&gt;assets and ran into the greatest volatility ever seen.  It’s easy to say they made a &lt;br /&gt;mistake.  But is it reasonable to expect them to have girded for unique events? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If every portfolio was required to be able to withstand declines on the scale we’ve &lt;br /&gt;witnessed this year, it’s possible no leverage would ever be used.  Is that a &lt;br /&gt;reasonable reaction?  (In fact, it’s possible that no one would ever invest in these &lt;br /&gt;asset classes, even on an unlevered basis.)   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In all aspects of our lives, we base our decisions on what we think probably will &lt;br /&gt;happen.  And, in turn, we base that to a great extent on what usually happened in &lt;br /&gt;the past.  We expect results to be close to the norm (A) most of the time, but we know &lt;br /&gt;it’s not unusual to see outcomes that are better or worse (B).  Although we should bear in &lt;br /&gt;mind that, once in a while, a result will be outside the usual range (C), we tend to forget &lt;br /&gt;about the potential for outliers.  And importantly, as illustrated by recent events, we &lt;br /&gt;rarely consider outcomes that have happened only once a century . . . or never (D). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we realize that unusual, unlikely things can happen, in order to act we make &lt;br /&gt;reasoned decisions and knowingly accept that risk when well paid to do so.  Once in a &lt;br /&gt;while, a “black swan” will materialize.  But if in the fu&lt;br /&gt;ture we always said, “We can’t do &lt;br /&gt;such-and-such, because we could see a repeat of 2007-08,” we’d be frozen in inaction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So in most things, you can’t prepare for the worst case.  It should suffice to be &lt;br /&gt;prepared for once-in-a-generation events.  But a generation isn’t forever, and there will &lt;br /&gt;be times when that standard is exceeded.  What do you do about that?  I’ve mused in the &lt;br /&gt;past about how much one should devote to preparing for the unlikely disaster.  &lt;br /&gt;Among other things, the events of 2007-08 prove there’s no easy answer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UAre You Tall Enough to Use Leverage? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clearly it’s difficult to always use the right amount of leverage, because it’s difficult to &lt;br /&gt;be sure you’re allowing sufficiently for risk.  Leverage should only be used on the basis &lt;br /&gt;of demonstrably cautious assumptions.   And it should be noted that if you’re doing &lt;br /&gt;something novel, unproven, risky, volatile or potentially life-threatening, you &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t seek to maximize returns.  Instead, err on the side of caution.  The key to &lt;br /&gt;survival lies in what Warren Buffett constantly harps on: margin of safety.  Using &lt;br /&gt;100% of the leverage one’s assets might justify is often incompatible with assuring &lt;br /&gt;survival when adverse outcomes materialize. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leverage is neither good nor bad in and of itself.  In the right amount, applied to the right &lt;br /&gt;assets, it’s good.  When used to excess given the underlying assets, it’s bad.  It doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;add value; it merely magnifies both good and bad outcomes.  So leverage shouldn’t be &lt;br /&gt;treated as a silver bullet or magic solution.  It’s a tool that can be used wisely or &lt;br /&gt;unwisely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our attitude at Oaktree is that it can be wise to use leverage to take advantage of &lt;br /&gt;high offered returns and excessive risk premiums, but it’s unwise to use it to try to &lt;br /&gt;turn low offered returns into high ones, as was done often in 2003-07. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once leverage is combined with risky or volatile assets, it can lead to unbearable losses.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus leverage should be used in prudent amounts, to finance the right assets, and with a &lt;br /&gt;great deal of respect.  And it’s better used in the trough of the cycle than after a long run &lt;br /&gt;of appreciation.  Bottom line: handle with care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never want to give the impression that doing the things I discuss is easy, or that Oaktree &lt;br /&gt;always gets it right.  This memo calls on investors to gauge risk and use only appropriate &lt;br /&gt;leverage.  At Oaktree we assess fundamental riskiness and look to history for how &lt;br /&gt;markets might behave, and we heavily emphasize trying to build in sufficient room for &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;error.  But history isn’t a perfect guide.  While we’ve made no use of leverage in the vast &lt;br /&gt;majority of our investment activities, three of our evergreen funds did borrow to buy &lt;br /&gt;bank loans: the senior-most debt of companies, which in the past always has traded &lt;br /&gt;around par.  Another used it to buy low-priced Japanese small-cap stocks.  The &lt;br /&gt;companies generally are doing fine, but the prices of their loans and equities have &lt;br /&gt;collapsed under current m&lt;br /&gt;arket conditions, causing the funds to suffer.  This shows how &lt;br /&gt;tough it is to prepare for all eventualities . . . in other words, to know in advance &lt;br /&gt;how bad is bad.  So I apologize if I ever come across as holier-than-thou.  We’ve tried to &lt;br /&gt;use leverage only when it’s wise, but no one’s perfect.  Certainly not us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The financial markets have delivered a lifetime of lessons in just the last five years.  &lt;br /&gt;Some of the most important ones center around the use and abuse of leverage.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Leverage doesn’t add value or make an investment better.  Like everything else in &lt;br /&gt;the investment world other than pure skill, leverage is a two-edged sword – in fact, &lt;br /&gt;probably the ultimate two-edged sword.  It helps when you’re right and hurts when &lt;br /&gt;you’re wrong.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The riskier the underlying assets, the less leverage should be used to buy them.  &lt;br /&gt;Conservative assumptions on this subject will keep you from maximizing gains but &lt;br /&gt;possibly save your financial life in bad times.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A levered entity can be caught up in a downward spiral of asset price declines, &lt;br /&gt;market-value tests, margin calls and forced selling.  Thus, in addition to thinking &lt;br /&gt;about the right amount of leverage, it’s important to note that there are two different &lt;br /&gt;kinds: permanent leverage, with its magnifying effect, and leverage which can be &lt;br /&gt;withdrawn, which can introduce collateral tests and the risk of ruin.  Both should be &lt;br /&gt;considered independently.  Leverage achieved with secure capital isn’t nearly as &lt;br /&gt;risky as situations where you are subject to margin calls or can’t bar the door &lt;br /&gt;against capital withdrawals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leverage was too easily accessed as recently as two years ago, and now it’s virtually &lt;br /&gt;unavailable.  And just as its use was often unwise a few years ago, this might be just &lt;br /&gt;the right time to employ some if you can get it . . . and if you can arrange things so &lt;br /&gt;you won’t drown if the streambed dips ahead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;December 17, 2008 &lt;br /&gt;2008 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:    Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: All That Glitters &lt;br /&gt;In 1952, Noah S. “Soggy” Sweat, Jr., a member of the Mississippi House of &lt;br /&gt;Representatives, was asked about his position on whiskey.  Here’s how he answered: &lt;br /&gt;If you mean whiskey, the devil’s brew, the poison scourge, the bloody &lt;br /&gt;monster that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, &lt;br /&gt;creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths &lt;br /&gt;of little children; if you mean that evil drink that topples Christian men &lt;br /&gt;and women from the pinnacles of righteous and gracious living into the &lt;br /&gt;bottomless pit of degradation, shame, despair, helplessness, and &lt;br /&gt;hopelessness, then, my friend, I am opposed to it with every fiber of my &lt;br /&gt;being. &lt;br /&gt;However, if by whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic &lt;br /&gt;wine, the elixir of life, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get &lt;br /&gt;together, that puts a song in their hearts and the warm glow of contentment &lt;br /&gt;in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer, the stimulating sip that puts a &lt;br /&gt;little spring in the step of an elderly gentleman on a frosty morning; if you &lt;br /&gt;mean that drink that enables man to magnify his joy, and to forget life’s &lt;br /&gt;great tragedies and heartbreaks and sorrow; if you mean that drink the sale &lt;br /&gt;of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars each year, that &lt;br /&gt;provides tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, &lt;br /&gt;our dumb, our pitifully aged and infirm, to build the finest highways, &lt;br /&gt;hospitals, universities, and community colleges in this nation, then my &lt;br /&gt;friend, I am absolutely, unequivocally in favor of it. &lt;br /&gt;This is my position, and as always, I refuse to compromise on matters of &lt;br /&gt;principle. &lt;br /&gt;Sweat’s response shows, depending on how you look at it, either how views can diverge &lt;br /&gt;on a given subject or how differently a tale can be spun.  Thus it serves well to introduce &lt;br /&gt;the topic of this memo: gold. &lt;br /&gt;Before the global financial crisis, most participants in the world of finance felt they &lt;br /&gt;understood how things worked, and that in addition to the underlying processes, they &lt;br /&gt;could rely on institutions and currencies.   &lt;br /&gt;Then the crisis occurred and a lot changed.  Things happened during the crisis that were &lt;br /&gt;described as “five-standard-deviation occurrences” (or three or eight).  In other words, &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things happened that had never happened before and had been considered capable of &lt;br /&gt;happening only once in several generations or centuries.  But they happened, and &lt;br /&gt;sometimes a few in a single week. &lt;br /&gt;These were negative “black swan” deve lopments, and they had a number of &lt;br /&gt;ramifications.  First, they imposed substantial losses.  Second, they called into question &lt;br /&gt;the predictability and understandability of the financial world and introduced new levels &lt;br /&gt;of uncertainty.  And third, they set off a search for things that would provide certainty &lt;br /&gt;and safety in the newly uncertain world.  This search led many to look to gold. &lt;br /&gt;On the Merits of Gold&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt: gold is the ideal investment.  It serves as a reliable store of value, &lt;br /&gt;especially in challenging and uncertain times.  It’s a hedge against inflation, since its &lt;br /&gt;price rises in sympathy with the general level of prices.  It exists without the involvement &lt;br /&gt;of man-made constructs such as governments.  And it’s desired and accepted all around &lt;br /&gt;the world (and always has been).   &lt;br /&gt;The supply of gold is finite.  It can’t be created out of thin air.  Thus it’s not subject to &lt;br /&gt;dilution or debasement, as is paper currency when governments decide to print more.  In &lt;br /&gt;comparison, currency can be similarly reliable only if backed by gold.   &lt;br /&gt;Finally, gold is tangible, meaning you can take delivery and store it.  Most other &lt;br /&gt;investment media exist only in the form of figures on a computer screen.  But gold is &lt;br /&gt;something you can actually hold and know you own.  Thus it’s one of the few things you &lt;br /&gt;can depend on in an uncertain world.  Gold is perfect. &lt;br /&gt;Except, of course, gold is nothing but a shiny metal.  Since its real-world applications are &lt;br /&gt;limited to jewelry and electronics, very little of its value comes from actual usefulness.  &lt;br /&gt;Further, the amount put to those uses each year is small compared to the total amount in &lt;br /&gt;existence, so its value for those purposes is at the margin and can’t be of much help in &lt;br /&gt;putting a price on the world’s gold reserves. &lt;br /&gt;There’s little intrinsic to gold that enables it to serve as a store of value and a hedge &lt;br /&gt;against inflation.  Gold serves those purposes only because people impute to it the ability &lt;br /&gt;to do so.  It’s self-deception, nothing but the object of mass hysteria like that exhibited in &lt;br /&gt;“The Emperor’s New Clothes.”  Gold has no financial value other than that which &lt;br /&gt;people accord it, and thus it should have no role in a serious investment program.  &lt;br /&gt;Of this I’m certain. &lt;br /&gt;A Never-Ending Argument&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The foregoing aren’t my views, of course.  Rather, they’re my effort to summarize the &lt;br /&gt;prevailing – and obviously polar – points of view regarding gold.  I think gold engenders &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;attitudes that are the furthest apart of those regarding any potential investment.  The &lt;br /&gt;“gold bugs” think it’s ideal and dependable, and the naysayers think it’s unanalyzable and &lt;br /&gt;anachronistic. &lt;br /&gt;Due to the trauma and uncertainty introduced by the financial crisis, the subject of gold &lt;br /&gt;has attracted increased attention and the debate has heated up.  It has doubled in price &lt;br /&gt;over roughly the last two years.  And I’ve been asked about gold more in those two years &lt;br /&gt;than in all the rest put together. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think about gold very much during my first 39 years in the money management &lt;br /&gt;business.  First I was an equity guy, and then I became a bond guy.  I never had a client &lt;br /&gt;who held gold (as far as I knew) and no one asked for my views on it.   In a world in &lt;br /&gt;which people thought they knew how things worked and everything went smoothly most &lt;br /&gt;of the time, gold was considered largely irrelevant.   &lt;br /&gt;For the last few years, I’ve advised a Swiss charitable foundation that, as is customary in &lt;br /&gt;its home country, holds substantial amounts of precious metals.  Thus I’ve had to think &lt;br /&gt;about gold – which I never had to do before – and come to a conclusion. &lt;br /&gt;My view is simple and starts with the observation that gold is a lot like religion.  No &lt;br /&gt;one can prove that God exists . . . or that God doesn’t exist.  The believer can’t convince &lt;br /&gt;the atheist, and the atheist can’t convince the believer.  It’s incredibly simple: either you &lt;br /&gt;believe in God or you don’t.  Well, that’s exactly the way I think it is with gold.  &lt;br /&gt;Either you’re a believer or you’re not. &lt;br /&gt;My View&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the past, the only thing I considered certain about gold was that I didn’t have to &lt;br /&gt;consider it.  But in the last few years, I did think (and write) on a subject very germane to &lt;br /&gt;gold: the valuation of non-income-producing assets. &lt;br /&gt;Show me a company, security or property that produces a stream of cash, and I think I &lt;br /&gt;can value it reasonably accurately.  P/E ratios, yields and capitalization rates give us a &lt;br /&gt;framework for valuing these things, and by comparing them to prevailing interest rates, to &lt;br /&gt;historic valuation parameters and to each other, we can assess whether an asset is dear or &lt;br /&gt;cheap. &lt;br /&gt;But there’s no analytical way, in my opinion, to value an asset that doesn’t produce &lt;br /&gt;cash flow . . . and especially one that doesn’t at least have the prospect of doing so.  &lt;br /&gt;(What I mean by the latter is that it’s more challenging to value an empty building than a &lt;br /&gt;rented one; or an empty lot compared to one with an office building on it; or a young &lt;br /&gt;company relative to an established, profitable one.  But at least you can attempt to value &lt;br /&gt;the former asset in each case on the basis of its potential to produce cash flow.)  How do &lt;br /&gt;you put a value on an asset that will never throw off cash? &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take oil, for example.  As I wrote in “There They Go Again” (May 6, 2005), you can say &lt;br /&gt;the supply of oil is finite; that we’re using it up faster than we’re find&lt;br /&gt;ing it; and that much &lt;br /&gt;of it is in the hands of nations we can’t depend on.  But what does that make it worth?  &lt;br /&gt;You could have said those things in December 2008, when oil was $35 a barrel, and if &lt;br /&gt;you’d bought you’d be up 150% today.  But they were equally true in July 2007, when oil &lt;br /&gt;was at $147, and if you bought you would have lost three-quarters of your money in six &lt;br /&gt;months.  Qualitative statements like those simply cannot be converted into a price. &lt;br /&gt;And how do you value a home?  The appraisals that were relied on by mortgage lenders &lt;br /&gt;in 2002-07 obviously did more harm than good.  All the appraisers did is compare each &lt;br /&gt;home to the last similar one that sold, and their work-product literally turned out not to be &lt;br /&gt;worth the paper it was printed on.  You might value a home based on what it could be &lt;br /&gt;rented for, but today’s vacancies show that you can find tenants for some houses but not &lt;br /&gt;all of them.  No, the value of a home at a given point in time ultimately is just what a &lt;br /&gt;buyer will pay for it. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, that’s true of all non-income-producing assets: they’re only worth what &lt;br /&gt;buyers will pay for them.  You might say that about income-producing assets as well, &lt;br /&gt;given how their prices fluctuate, but that’s completely true only in the short run and &lt;br /&gt;mostly when markets function poorly.  If assets produce cash flow, that gives them value, &lt;br /&gt;and it’s reasonable to believe that eventually their prices will move in the direction of that &lt;br /&gt;value.  They aren’t required to do so in any particular time frame, but that expectation &lt;br /&gt;provides the most solid basis there is for investing.  Everything else is mere conjecture &lt;br /&gt;by comparison, and that goes for gold.   &lt;br /&gt;At What Price?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In “Hemlines” in September, I said investors were pursuing safety – simplistically, as &lt;br /&gt;they usually do the flavor of the day – but ignoring the price they were paying for it.  I &lt;br /&gt;titled that section “At What Price?” &lt;br /&gt;I’m reusing that heading here, because that’s really the key question in investing.  We all &lt;br /&gt;would prefer to have growth, quality, income and safety in our investments.  But how &lt;br /&gt;much will we pay for them?  I’ve said it many times: no asset can be considered a &lt;br /&gt;good idea (or a bad idea) without reference to its price.  How can we evaluate whether &lt;br /&gt;the price of gold is right? &lt;br /&gt;As with oil, you can list gold’s attractions as enumerated on page two.  But how do &lt;br /&gt;you turn them into a price?  And don’t you have to be able to turn them into a price &lt;br /&gt;in order to invest intelligently?  Consider this conversation:  &lt;br /&gt;Howard:  How do you feel about gold here at $1,400 an ounce? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  Great.  I’m sure it will hold its value from here and keep up with inflation. &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howard:  Would you be equally sure if it were $2,000? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  A little less, but yes. &lt;br /&gt;Howard:  At $5,000? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  That’s a tough one. &lt;br /&gt;Howard:  And at $10,000? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  No; there it would be ahead of itself. &lt;br /&gt;Howard:  So the price of gold matters? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  Sure. &lt;br /&gt;Howard:  Then how can you be sure it’s fairly priced at $1,400? &lt;br /&gt;Gold bug:  Hmm . . . . . &lt;br /&gt;The point is, in investing, price has to matter.  Nothing can be a good buy solely on &lt;br /&gt;the basis of its attributes alone, without considering the value they giv&lt;br /&gt;e rise to and &lt;br /&gt;the relationship of price to that value.  And there’s no quantifiable value against &lt;br /&gt;which to compare price in the case of gold.  There; that’s it.  Either you agree with &lt;br /&gt;those statements or you don’t. &lt;br /&gt;The gold bug’s usual recourse to the difficulty in pricing gold is to point to a past price &lt;br /&gt;for the metal and how little it has appreciated since then.  For example, gold hit a high of &lt;br /&gt;$850 in 1980 and has gained only 2% per year since then.  The Leuthold Group is often &lt;br /&gt;quoted (e.g., Reuters, November 29) as observing that it would have to be at $2,400 today &lt;br /&gt;to merely equal the 1980 price in inflation-adjusted terms.   &lt;br /&gt;But those making a claim for gold’s cheapness on the basis of comparisons against &lt;br /&gt;historic prices typically point to hand-selected observations, as in Leuthold’s case.  What &lt;br /&gt;about the fact that gold was $250 in mid-1999 (Financial Times, November 13), meaning &lt;br /&gt;it’s been up 16% a year for the last decade-plus?  And even if the snail-like appreciation &lt;br /&gt;from $850 in 1980 seems persuasive, how do we know gold was priced reasonably in &lt;br /&gt;1980, and thus that the fact that it’s low relative to 1980 makes it reasonable today?  If &lt;br /&gt;gold was overpriced in the past, then even having failed to show much appreciation in the &lt;br /&gt;interim, it could still be overpriced today. &lt;br /&gt;In Gold We Trust&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the 1970s I came across a book called Money Is Love by Richard Condon.  I bought it &lt;br /&gt;because I had enjoyed The Manchurian Candidate, a 1962 movie based on another &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condon book.  All I remember about Money Is Love is that it was set in a period when&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;people were crazy about collectable plates and amassed them as a store of value.  One &lt;br /&gt;person had so many that their weight made his apartment collapse into the one beneath it.   &lt;br /&gt;In the book, collectable plates had value for the simple reason that people felt they did.  &lt;br /&gt;That sounds silly.  But is gold any different?  Are there better reasons for it to have &lt;br /&gt;value? &lt;br /&gt;My point here is the one I’ve held longest on this topic: that gold works as a store of &lt;br /&gt;value solely because people agree it will.  For years I’ve felt that there’s nothing special &lt;br /&gt;about gold that makes it right for this role.  It just happens to be the metal people began to &lt;br /&gt;lust after a few millennia ago.  It could have been iron, but iron is too common and thus &lt;br /&gt;not special enough: it doesn’t shine, and it rusts.  It could have been platinum, but people &lt;br /&gt;couldn’t find it, or enough of it for it to be popular.  Perhaps the fact that gold got the job &lt;br /&gt;is just a coincidence. &lt;br /&gt;But what about the other hand?  (For thoughtful people, I think there’s always another &lt;br /&gt;hand.)  Let’s say we disrespect gold given that it has value only because people agree &lt;br /&gt;it does.  What about the U.S. dollar?  Why do we accord the dollar value, or any other &lt;br /&gt;paper currency for that matter?  It has value because the government says it does, and we &lt;br /&gt;go along.  Sound familiar? &lt;br /&gt;Forty years ago, you could turn in paper money and get an ounce of gold for each $35.  &lt;br /&gt;Then President Nixon ended the convertibility of gold in 1971 and that was no longer &lt;br /&gt;possible.  Now there’s nothing behind the dollar but people’s belief in it.  &lt;br /&gt;As an aside, when I was working on Wall Street for the first time in the summer of 1967, &lt;br /&gt;the government announced that it was going to terminate the convertibility of banknotes &lt;br /&gt;labeled “silver certificates.”  So I found a dozen or so in my wallet and took them to the &lt;br /&gt;Federal Assay Office on a nearby street called Old Slip.  The clerk counted them, put the &lt;br /&gt;equivalent weights on one side of a huge balance scale, poured granulated silver onto the &lt;br /&gt;other side from a bag, and handed the silver to me in an envelope.  I’m very glad that I &lt;br /&gt;still have it today, plus a few silver certificates that I didn’t convert . . . plus the rest of &lt;br /&gt;my memories of those early days. &lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia defines “fiat currency” as “state-issued money which is neither legally &lt;br /&gt;convertible to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.”  &lt;br /&gt;Today the non-convertible dollar (like most other currencies) is a fiat currency.  &lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia goes on to say fiat currencies “lack intrinsic value.”   &lt;br /&gt;So if I complain that gold lacks intrinsic value, perhaps my wariness should also &lt;br /&gt;make me question dollars (and euros, pound sterling and yen).  If gold has the &lt;br /&gt;limitations I describe in this regard, what can we say about currencies?  (Bruce &lt;br /&gt;Karsh goes on to raise a further conundrum: we may prefer income-producing assets, &lt;br /&gt;with their intrinsic value, to fiat currency.  But the income they produce is reckoned in &lt;br /&gt;currency, and thus their value is as well.  So, is the value of those assets any more “real” &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;than currency?  What does have real value?  Maybe just things with actual usefulness and &lt;br /&gt;not just monetary value, like farms.  It cer&lt;br /&gt;tainly does get complicated.) &lt;br /&gt;We can talk about the fact that gold’s value isn’t intrinsic or quantifiable.  But the &lt;br /&gt;question really comes down to whether people’s faith in gold will increase or erode.  &lt;br /&gt;Relevant here is a profound observation regarding markets from John Maynard Keynes. &lt;br /&gt;In Keynes’s time, a London newspaper ran photos of a large number of young women, &lt;br /&gt;with a prize going to the reader whose list of the five prettiest most closely paralleled the &lt;br /&gt;votes of all readers.  The winning strategy wouldn’t be to try to pick the prettiest &lt;br /&gt;contestants, but rather the ones most voters will say are the prettiest.  In other words, &lt;br /&gt;one’s contest submission shouldn’t be based on intrinsic merit, but on guesses regarding &lt;br /&gt;the other participants’ views of intrinsic merit.  The same is true for investments, &lt;br /&gt;including gold.  Thus it’s not whether gold has value, but whether people will impute &lt;br /&gt;value to it. &lt;br /&gt;But it goes further.  Especially in the short run, the superior investor may not be the one &lt;br /&gt;who’s right about the merit of something, or even the one who’s right about the &lt;br /&gt;consensus view of merit.  Rather, the superior investor may be the one who’s right about &lt;br /&gt;the judgments other people will make about the consensus view of merit. &lt;br /&gt;It is not a case of choosing those [faces] that, to the best of one’s &lt;br /&gt;judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion &lt;br /&gt;genuinely thinks the prettiest.  We have reached the third degree where we &lt;br /&gt;devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the &lt;br /&gt;average opinion to be.  And there are some, I believe, who practice the &lt;br /&gt;fourth, fifth and higher degrees.  (General Theory of Employment Interest &lt;br /&gt;and Money, 1936). &lt;br /&gt;Will people continue to impute value to gold?  Or will they bet that others will &lt;br /&gt;continue to impute value to gold?  Those are the key questions.  It’s hard to predict &lt;br /&gt;change in these things, but it’s the change that makes and eliminates fortunes. &lt;br /&gt;Gold in Times of Uncertainty&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the last six weeks, in addition to North America, I have visited with clients and &lt;br /&gt;contacts in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America.  Perhaps the greatest common &lt;br /&gt;thread I detected was a sense that the world is more uncertain, and the range of &lt;br /&gt;possible outcomes wider, than ever before.  People who before the crisis felt they &lt;br /&gt;understood how economies and governments work – and thus what could be expected in &lt;br /&gt;the future – now feel very differently. &lt;br /&gt;Today we’re faced with uncertainty regarding a vast list of issues including: &lt;br /&gt;the outlook for economic growth,&lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ramifications of high debt levels and the necessary austerity measures,&lt;br /&gt;the economic future of the developed world,&lt;br /&gt;the impact of China and other emerging nations,&lt;br /&gt;the likelihood of deflation versus hyperinflation, and&lt;br /&gt;the soundness of currencies and sovereign debt.&lt;br /&gt;Thus it shouldn’t come as a surprise that people are groping for something they can &lt;br /&gt;depend on.  Since gold acts as a barometer of expectations regarding inflation and &lt;br /&gt;concern about economies and currencies, its popularity has risen as sentiment &lt;br /&gt;regarding these things has declined. &lt;br /&gt;Being away from home tends to alter one’s perspective.  While traveling, I was shocked &lt;br /&gt;to hear someone (okay, a gold producer possibly “talking his book”) describe the U.S. as &lt;br /&gt;having a corrupt political system in the grip of special interests and being committed to &lt;br /&gt;the debasement of the dollar.  While I know the stimulative actions being undertaken may &lt;br /&gt;well cause the dollar to weaken, I like to think the part about corruption isn’t true.  &lt;br /&gt;But I have to admit that I’m not all that happy with what’s going on in the U.S., and &lt;br /&gt;especially in Washington, D.C. (see “What Worries Me,” August 2008 and “I’d Rather &lt;br /&gt;Be Wrong,” March 2010).  While other nations are enacting austerity measures to trim &lt;br /&gt;their deficits and debt, I don’t see much coming from Washington.  So if not corrupt, then &lt;br /&gt;perhaps just weak-kneed. &lt;br /&gt;The recent compromise tax “solution” is a good example (merits of the provisions&lt;br /&gt;aside): “I’ll agree to continue the tax cuts and reduce estate tax rates for the wealthy&lt;br /&gt;(exacerbating the deficit) if you’ll vote to extend unemployment benefits, cut payroll&lt;br /&gt;taxes and increase tax credits (exacerbating the deficit).”  There’s something for&lt;br /&gt;everyone in this bill, with its estimated cost of $858 billion over ten years.  The only&lt;br /&gt;element missing from both sides’ agendas is fiscal discipline.&lt;br /&gt;And what about the vote on the proposals from the President’s commission on the&lt;br /&gt;deficit?  While the appointed members of the commission generally backed them,&lt;br /&gt;they failed to get the needed supermajority because six of the ten elected officials&lt;br /&gt;who care about reelection voted no.  These are tough issues, and by definition every&lt;br /&gt;possible solution will raise taxes or reduce government services.  The fact is that most&lt;br /&gt;elected legislators seem unable to take any actions that might cost them votes.&lt;br /&gt;Questions about the dollar are being raised worldwide.  Thus an interesting result of &lt;br /&gt;being abroad is that what looks like an increase in the dollar price of gold becomes &lt;br /&gt;easier to view as a decrease in the amount of gold a dollar will buy.  So perhaps we &lt;br /&gt;should think about the dollar’s weakness rather than gold’s strength.  Here’s a post &lt;br /&gt;from a Reuters blogger: &lt;br /&gt;If you look at the price of gold in a currency other than U.S. dollars, for &lt;br /&gt;instance Australian dollars, it hasn’t gone up at all over the last few years.  &lt;br /&gt;Gold isn’t booming at the moment.  The U.S. dollar is crashing.  You &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;think [gold is] worth a lot of U.S. dollars now?  Just wait until QE4 or &lt;br /&gt;QE5. &lt;br /&gt;This may or may not be from a qualified observer, but it’s indicative of current sentiment.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s interesting in this connection that The Wall Street Journal reported as follows on &lt;br /&gt;December 3: &lt;br /&gt;Data cited Thursday by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency showed &lt;br /&gt;that China imported 209.7 metric tons of gold in the first 10 months of the &lt;br /&gt;year, a fivefold increase compared with the same period last year. &lt;br /&gt;That surpassed purchases made by ETFs and surprised analysts, who until &lt;br /&gt;now had no clear insight into the size of China’s buying. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;“Everybody in the gold market knew there was a surge in investment &lt;br /&gt;demand, but they didn’t know it was China,” said Jeff Christian, managing &lt;br /&gt;director at CPM Group. . . . &lt;br /&gt;[This news] comes as the government loosens its restrictions on gold &lt;br /&gt;purchases by financial institutions and individual investors. &lt;br /&gt;Money has to go someplace, and in these uncertain times, gold seems to be a destination &lt;br /&gt;of choice.  Further, some of the objections to gold have eased: &lt;br /&gt;It used to be difficult and costly to transact in, especially in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;But the creation of easily tradable ETFs has eased that concern.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, people would complain about the fact that gold doesn’t throw off&lt;br /&gt;current income.  But with interest rates ultra-low thanks to central banks, not&lt;br /&gt;much else does, either.&lt;br /&gt;Removing impediments like these has the effect of increasing demand relative to &lt;br /&gt;supply.  The short-run impact on price is clear. &lt;br /&gt;The Usefulness of Gold as a Reserve Currency&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In many ways, the rise in the popularity of gold may be largely the result of a &lt;br /&gt;process of elimination.  Here’s a helpful analysis from “Gold’s Allure Grows Amid &lt;br /&gt;Instability,” by James Saft writing in the International Herald Tribune (November 10): &lt;br /&gt;Real assets are the place to be when the solvency of the banking system is &lt;br /&gt;threatened and the authorities refuse to deal directly with it. &lt;br /&gt;With trillions in bank collateral that is worth less than its stated value on &lt;br /&gt;paper and with a U.S. economy mired in a balance sheet recession, the &lt;br /&gt;temptation to take care of these issues by creating more backed-by-nothing &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money is too great.  This is exactly what the Federal Reserve is doing in &lt;br /&gt;its latest $600 billion round of quantitative easing. &lt;br /&gt;This in turn is an invitation to the rest of the world to print money right &lt;br /&gt;back.  There is no brake on this system other than the ability of nations to &lt;br /&gt;cooperate, and right now cooperation is not in everyone’s individual &lt;br /&gt;interest. . . . &lt;br /&gt;You could argue that where we are now was a likely outcome of the &lt;br /&gt;current system.  A global reserve currency in a fiat system creates &lt;br /&gt;trem&lt;br /&gt;endous incentives to take on too much debt. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, when (a) your income is inadequate to cover your spending, (b) you &lt;br /&gt;can borrow from abroad to cover the shortfall, (c) you can print the world’s reserve &lt;br /&gt;currency with which to repay debt and (d) that currency isn’t required to be backed &lt;br /&gt;by something tangible such as gold, printing money seems like the easy way out.  But &lt;br /&gt;as the world is learning about many things, that won’t work without limitation. &lt;br /&gt;The Financial Times reported as follows on November 13: &lt;br /&gt;Some policymakers think it is dangerous to rely on a single reserve &lt;br /&gt;currency, the dollar, from an economy that needs to borrow heavily from &lt;br /&gt;abroad.  Amid Friday’s failure of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging &lt;br /&gt;nations to reach any meaningful accord on global imbalances, France has &lt;br /&gt;promised as part of its G20 presidency next year to start a debate about the &lt;br /&gt;world’s future monetary arrangements. &lt;br /&gt;The world needs a reserve currency (or more than one).  What candidates are there?  The &lt;br /&gt;U.S. dollar, euro, sterling, yen, renminbi and gold.   &lt;br /&gt;The dollar has problems these days, and the world’s opinion of it as a reserve currency is &lt;br /&gt;on the decline.  If it hasn’t fallen much in recent years relative to the euro and sterling – &lt;br /&gt;and in fact it’s up strongly since late 2007 – that’s mainly because the other two have &lt;br /&gt;bigger problems.  Only the yen has strengthened relative to the dollar, due to belief in &lt;br /&gt;Japan’s conservatism and solidity (although its massive national debt suggests &lt;br /&gt;otherwise).   &lt;br /&gt;Here’s how World Bank president Robert Zoellick put it a month ago in arguing for a &lt;br /&gt;limited role for gold in the world monetary system: &lt;br /&gt;Gold has become a reference point because holders of money see weak or &lt;br /&gt;uncertain growth prospects in all currencies other than the renminbi, and &lt;br /&gt;the renminbi is not free for exchange. &lt;br /&gt;That leads by default to gold.  It’s unlikely to take over from the others, but it may see &lt;br /&gt;further increases in demand, especially if nations conclude that the gold component of &lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their reserves is too small relative to currency holdings.  On the other hand, the role for &lt;br /&gt;gold appears likely to be limited because the small amount of gold that trades – and the &lt;br /&gt;swings in sentim&lt;br /&gt;ent (and thus supply and demand) – render it awfully volatile for a &lt;br /&gt;serious component of the world monetary system.  Further, the finiteness of the gold &lt;br /&gt;supply would limit potential economic growth in a gold-backed monetary system. &lt;br /&gt;Most things in the international arena seem to argue against the dollar, and that can be &lt;br /&gt;viewed as implicitly arguing for an increased role for gold relative to the dollar.  But &lt;br /&gt;remember that because it can’t be assessed quantitatively, no one can say &lt;br /&gt;definitively that the current price for gold doesn’t already recognize and reflect all &lt;br /&gt;of the dollar’s problems (and all of gold’s merits).   &lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was about two years ago that I first noted the similarity between gold and religion.  &lt;br /&gt;Before that, I had always been a non-believer in gold (not strongly anti, just indifferent).  &lt;br /&gt;But I concluded at the time – just as any wary agnostic might about God – that whereas I &lt;br /&gt;didn’t believe in gold, I couldn’t be 100% certain that was the right position.  (It’s like &lt;br /&gt;someone who considers himself non-superstitious but still favors lucky numbers and &lt;br /&gt;daily rituals “just in case.”)  So I stopped arguing against gold with any vehemence. &lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I also concluded that since gold has “worked” for hundreds of years, it &lt;br /&gt;probably will keep on doing so.  It might not do so forever, but what’s the probability this &lt;br /&gt;will be the year it stops?  So I wouldn’t bet against it, and I might recommend a position &lt;br /&gt;“just in case.”  Not because I view gold affirmatively as a moneymaker, but rather as a &lt;br /&gt;useful contributor to safety through diversification.  Surely the uncertain world situation &lt;br /&gt;seems to call for all the protection against the unknown that we can amass.   &lt;br /&gt;Still, the other hand brings me back to price.  Yes, gold is probably more likely to &lt;br /&gt;continue serving as a store of value than to quit.  And yes, maybe one should have a &lt;br /&gt;position.  But is this the right price at which to start . . . ? &lt;br /&gt;December 17, 2010&lt;br /&gt;2010 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Déjà Vu All Over Again &lt;br /&gt;What good is history?  After all, it‟s in the past. &lt;br /&gt;The truth is, history can be one of our greatest aids . . . in investing as in life.  Here in the fifth &lt;br /&gt;decade of my investment career, I feel a lot of my ability to add value comes from the amount of &lt;br /&gt;history I‟ve witnessed and the significance I‟ve extracted from it. &lt;br /&gt;Regular readers know I often include time-tested quotations in my memos.  Why wouldn‟t I?  &lt;br /&gt;They‟ve endured precisely because they‟re so relevant and so well put.  Why try to reinvent the &lt;br /&gt;wheel, rewriting them, only to come up short?  On this subject, several stand out.  I‟ve used them &lt;br /&gt;all before, some more than once: &lt;br /&gt;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  (George &lt;br /&gt;Santayana) &lt;br /&gt;The farther back you can look, t&lt;br /&gt;he farther forward you are likely to see.  &lt;br /&gt;(Winston Churchill) &lt;br /&gt;History doesn‟t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.  (Mark Twain) &lt;br /&gt;Contributing to . . . eu&lt;br /&gt;phoria are two further factors little noted in our time or in &lt;br /&gt;past times.  The first is the extreme brevity of the financial memory.  In &lt;br /&gt;consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten.  &lt;br /&gt;In further consequence, &lt;br /&gt;when the same or closely similar circumstances occur again . . . they are hailed &lt;br /&gt;by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a &lt;br /&gt;brilliantly innovative discovery . . . .  There can be few fields of human endeavor &lt;br /&gt;in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance.  Past experience, to &lt;br /&gt;the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of &lt;br /&gt;those who do not have insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.  &lt;br /&gt;(John Kenneth Galbraith) &lt;br /&gt;One of the greatest differences between humans and animals is supposed to lie in the fact that we &lt;br /&gt;can learn other than through direct experience.  We don‟t have to sit on a hot stove to learn not to &lt;br /&gt;do it.  We can learn from history and from lessons passed on by our predecessors – things they &lt;br /&gt;experienced or learned from others in turn – so that we needn‟t experience them ourselves.  But to &lt;br /&gt;enjoy this benefit, we must pay heed to the people and events that preceded us. &lt;br /&gt;As Twain said, the events of history don‟t repeat exactly.  It‟s rarely the very same thing over and &lt;br /&gt;over.  In investing, for example, the duration and amplitude of fluctuations are rarely the same &lt;br /&gt;from cycle to cycle.  (It drives me crazy when people say, “high yield bonds tend to default &lt;br /&gt;around the second anniversary of their issuance.”  That happened to be the average for one &lt;br /&gt;particular period, but there‟s no reason for it to be true, and thus no reason it should be a useful &lt;br /&gt;rule going forward.) &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Twain also said, there are themes that rhyme.  It‟s what I would call “tendencies” or &lt;br /&gt;“behavioral patterns” that present the important lessons.  The tendency of investors to overlook or &lt;br /&gt;forget the past is noteworthy.  So is their habit of succumbing to emotion and swallowing tall (but &lt;br /&gt;potentially lucrative) tales.  In particular, people tend to forget the cyclical nature of things, &lt;br /&gt;extrapolate past trends to excess, and ignore the likelihood of regression to the mean.   &lt;br /&gt;The tech bubble may not recur anytime soon.  No online grocer may ever again sell at 200 times &lt;br /&gt;revenues.  There may never be another CDO-squared or SIV.  Those aren‟t the things that matter.  &lt;br /&gt;But there’s sure to be another cycle, another bubble and another crisis.  There’ll be another &lt;br /&gt;time when people overpay for exciting investment ideas because their future appears &lt;br /&gt;limitless, and then a time of disillusionment and price collapse.  There’ll be another period &lt;br /&gt;when leverage is embraced to excess, and then, consequently, a period when it gets people &lt;br /&gt;killed.  And there’ll certainly be another time when people can only imagine the possibility &lt;br /&gt;of gain, and then one when – after huge sums have been lost – they can think only of further &lt;br /&gt;declines. &lt;br /&gt;These are the kinds of things that rhyme.  If we stay alert, we can anticipate and recognize them &lt;br /&gt;and thus avoid the losses and opportunity costs they bring so reliably. &lt;br /&gt;The Death of Equities &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the ideas for my memos come from the gradual accretion of insights over a long &lt;br /&gt;period of time, and sometimes they come from a single inspiration.  This time it‟s the latter.  &lt;br /&gt;Lying in bed sleepless on Sunday the 11th,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;while on a business trip to South America, I dug into &lt;br /&gt;my Oaktree bag for something to read.  I came across a reprint of “The Death of Equities” from &lt;br /&gt;BusinessWeek magazine of August 13, 1979.  I‟d spoken about it over lunch with Josh Kuntz of &lt;br /&gt;Rivulet Capital, and he was good enough to send it to me at my request.  As I read it thoroughly &lt;br /&gt;for the first time in 33 years, my wife Nancy‟s battle cry rang out: “This calls for a memo.” &lt;br /&gt;This was a seminal article, signaling a tectonic shift in investing.  Here was its thrust: &lt;br /&gt;Seven million shareholders have defected from the stock market since 1970. &lt;br /&gt;The Labor Department has interpreted ERISA as giving institutions that invest pension &lt;br /&gt;money the ability to go beyond listed stocks and high grade bonds and into “shares of small &lt;br /&gt;companies, real estate, commodity futures and into gold and diamonds.”  Thus they were &lt;br /&gt;“pouring money into . . . mortgage-backed paper, foreign securities, venture capital, leases, &lt;br /&gt;guaranteed insurance contracts, indexed bonds, stock options, and futures.” &lt;br /&gt; “Whereas stocks once made up 80% of mutual fund assets, today that figure has slumped to &lt;br /&gt;less than 50%.” &lt;br /&gt;“Few corporations can find buyers for their stocks.” &lt;br /&gt;All of these things were the result of thirteen years of rapid inflation and ten years of returns &lt;br /&gt;on equities averaging less than 3% per year.   &lt;br /&gt;“The Labor Department ruling is just one more in a nearly endless string of unhealthy things &lt;br /&gt;that have happened to the stock market over the past decade.” &lt;br /&gt;“This „death of equity‟ can no longer be seen as something a stock market rally – however &lt;br /&gt;strong – will check.” &lt;br /&gt;“For better or for worse, then, the U.S. economy probably has to regard the death of equities &lt;br /&gt;as [a] near-permanent condition – reversible some day, but not soon.” &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to BusinessWeek, then, it was all over for equities.  No one would ever buy them &lt;br /&gt;again. &lt;br /&gt;Whatever caused it, the institutio&lt;br /&gt;nalization of inflation – along with structural &lt;br /&gt;changes in communications and psychology – have killed the U.S. equity market &lt;br /&gt;for millions of investors.   &lt;br /&gt;What a negative article, ostensibly the death knell for an entire market.  What was the shift that &lt;br /&gt;it marked?  Simply this: the end of a lost decade for equities and the beginning of the &lt;br /&gt;greatest bull market in history. &lt;br /&gt;There‟s literally a lifetime of memos in that one magazine article, but I‟ll spend a little less than &lt;br /&gt;that dissecting it.  I hope you‟ll find these comments useful. &lt;br /&gt;Yogi Lives &lt;br /&gt;Lawrence “Yogi” Berra was a baseball catcher and an integral part of the New York Yankees‟ &lt;br /&gt;successful dynasty in the middle of the twentieth century.  While a great player,  he was also the &lt;br /&gt;undisputed king of the tortured phrase or malapropism.  Here are a few:  &lt;br /&gt;“It ain‟t over ‟til it‟s over.” &lt;br /&gt;“Ninety percent of the game is half mental.” &lt;br /&gt;“When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”  &lt;br /&gt;“Always go to other people‟s funerals, otherwise they won‟t go to yours.” &lt;br /&gt;In fact, Yogi supplied the title for this memo, saying “It‟s déjà vu all over again.”  Rising to his &lt;br /&gt;own defense, however, he denied the tendency for which he is so well known, saying, “I really &lt;br /&gt;didn‟t say everything I said.” &lt;br /&gt;Do people really say things like these?  Or was it just Yogi?  Well, the writer of “The Death of &lt;br /&gt;Equities” gave him stiff competition: &lt;br /&gt;. . . with ever-escalating real estate prices . . . land is a hedge against loss. &lt;br /&gt;One of the few things I‟m sure of is that no price will be “ever-escalating.” &lt;br /&gt;Individuals . . . are flocking into money market funds to nail down high rates. &lt;br /&gt;In a money-market fund, the period for which you nail down a rate of interest is measured in just &lt;br /&gt;days.  In fact, the prime drawback of holding short-term paper is its failure to lock in a yield.  One &lt;br /&gt;of the biggest mistakes I‟ve witnessed took place when people invested in one-year certificates of &lt;br /&gt;deposit in 1981 at 16%, rather than multi-year CDs at rates a little lower.   &lt;br /&gt;For investors . . . low stock prices remain a disincentive to buy. &lt;br /&gt;What the writer is saying is that low prices point up how badly stocks have done over the &lt;br /&gt;preceding period and thus discourage investors from participating in the market.  This is totally &lt;br /&gt;illogical, but in the investment world we hear things like it every day:   &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone knows XYZ is underpriced.”  If everyone knows it‟s underpriced, why haven‟t &lt;br /&gt;they bought it and forced up its price?  &lt;br /&gt;“Nobody will touch ABC; it‟s too risky.”  If they know it‟s risky – presumably because its &lt;br /&gt;price is too high – and are shunning it or selling, why hasn‟t its price settled down to a level &lt;br /&gt;where it‟s safe?  &lt;br /&gt;The writer continued: &lt;br /&gt;Indeed, the average stock price is now about 60% of the replacement value of the &lt;br /&gt;underlying assets . . . &lt;br /&gt; . . . companies have jumped on low stock prices to set off the biggest takeover &lt;br /&gt;binge in history  . . . &lt;br /&gt;. . . buying at these prices is cheaper than building. &lt;br /&gt;The writer would look smarter today if he had recognized the implications of the fact that stocks &lt;br /&gt;were selling for less than their underlying asset value, and that companies were buying up other &lt;br /&gt;companies for that reason.  But he didn‟t.  He also didn‟t ask why, if it was smart for companies &lt;br /&gt;to buy other companies‟ shares, it didn‟t make sense for investors to buy those same shares.  &lt;br /&gt;(Note: it was largely the ability to buy companies cheaper in the stock market than you could &lt;br /&gt;build them that gave pioneers of leveraged buyouts such as KKR, Apax and Warburg Pincus the &lt;br /&gt;great returns on their purchases in the 1970s.) &lt;br /&gt;It would take a sustained bull market for a couple of years to attract broad-based &lt;br /&gt;investor interest and restore confidence.  &lt;br /&gt;This one reminds me of my absolute favorite Yogi-ism: “Nobody goes [to that restaurant] &lt;br /&gt;anymore.  It‟s too crowded.”  Wait a minute: how can a restaurant be crowded if nobody goes &lt;br /&gt;there? &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, in this case, according to the writer, it will take a bull market to attract investor interest &lt;br /&gt;and confidence.  That sounds reasonable.  But isn‟t investor interest and confidence a prerequisite &lt;br /&gt;for a bull market?  Without it, how can a bull market get started? &lt;br /&gt;The answer is that when prices are low enough, stocks can begin to rise without help from a full-&lt;br /&gt;fledged bull market, just as when they‟re high enough, stock prices can collapse under their own &lt;br /&gt;weight. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is si&lt;br /&gt;mple, and I‟m thoroughly convinced of it:  Common sense isn’t &lt;br /&gt;common.  T&lt;br /&gt;he crowd is invariably wrong at the extremes.  In the investing world, &lt;br /&gt;everything that’s intuitively obvious is questionable and everything that’s important is &lt;br /&gt;counter-intuitive.  And investors prove repeatedly that they can be less logical than Yogi. &lt;br /&gt;The Penalty of Youth &lt;br /&gt;Let‟s think back to Galbraith‟s statement that “Past experience . . . is dismissed as the primitive &lt;br /&gt;refuge of those who do not have insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.”  &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;br /&gt;other words, when a hot new investment fad gets rolling and an idea is elevated to bubble status, &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those with memory of the past – who might point out that the merits are overstated and the price &lt;br /&gt;is too high – are dismissed as “too old to get it.” &lt;br /&gt;The Money Game, written in 1968 by George Goodman under the pseudonym Adam Smith, &lt;br /&gt;included among its characters the Great Winfield.  Even though he was the dean of the brokerage &lt;br /&gt;office, he was able to make money in the hot stocks of the day.  When asked how, he said, “My &lt;br /&gt;solution to the current market: kids.  This is a kids‟ market. . . .  The strength of my kids is that &lt;br /&gt;they are too young to remember anything bad, and they are making so much money they feel &lt;br /&gt;invincible.”  This exactly parallels Galbraith‟s observation. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, veterans are often held back by experience and historic norms, and thus they miss &lt;br /&gt;out on the “new thing.”  Only those who are free of those strictures can participate fully in the &lt;br /&gt;latest miracle . . . as long as it lasts. &lt;br /&gt;“The Death of Equities” leaned heavily on this line of reasoning, but in the opposite direction.  &lt;br /&gt;You have to be young, it said, not to comprehend the new miracle, but to note the obsolescence of &lt;br /&gt;the old standby: &lt;br /&gt;Only the elderly, who have not understood the changes in the nation‟s financial &lt;br /&gt;markets, or are unable to adjust to them, are sticking with stocks.  &lt;br /&gt;Today, the old attitude of buying solid stocks as a cornerstone for one‟s life &lt;br /&gt;savings and retirement has simply disappeared.  Says a young U.S. executive: &lt;br /&gt;“Have you been to an American stockholders‟ meeting lately?  They‟re all old &lt;br /&gt;fogeys.  The stock market is just not where the action‟s at.” &lt;br /&gt;And what consistently provides the foundation for this insistence that the game has &lt;br /&gt;permanently changed?  Four of the most dangerous words in the investment world: it’s &lt;br /&gt;different this time.   &lt;br /&gt;When investors choose to believe that historic valuation standards have become irrelevant; that &lt;br /&gt;one industry or product can maintain superior growth and profitability in perpetuity; or that one &lt;br /&gt;asset or market can outperform all the others forever regardless of how high its price goes in the &lt;br /&gt;process – that is, that trees can grow to the sky – the bubble is invariably undergirded by a &lt;br /&gt;steadfast belief that it‟s different this time.  Here‟s the support BusinessWeek advanced: &lt;br /&gt;Says Alan Coleman, dean of Southern Methodist University‟s business school, &lt;br /&gt;“We have entered a new financial age.  The old rules no longer apply.” &lt;br /&gt;When you see or hear words like these, you should go on high alert.  Sometimes the world &lt;br /&gt;changes and the past becomes irrelevant, but most of the time I‟ll take the other side of that bet. &lt;br /&gt;Getting to the Truth &lt;br /&gt;In some ways, understanding the market is like mathematics.  You don‟t have to be &lt;br /&gt;knowledgeable regarding the specifics of the underlying subject matter to know whether a &lt;br /&gt;conclusion makes sense.  You just have to be able to apply principles, tell logic from illogic, and &lt;br /&gt;exclude the deleterious effects of emotion and psychology. &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‟s dissect “The Death of Equities” in that vein.  What it says is that inflation has eaten into the &lt;br /&gt;outlook for the economy and companies, and there‟s no hope for improvement.  Thus people have &lt;br /&gt;been throwing in the towel and selling stocks.  Other things have come into vogue, attracting the &lt;br /&gt;capital that used to be invested in&lt;br /&gt; stocks.  Mutual fund investors have turned their attention &lt;br /&gt;elsewhere.  Most corporations can‟t issue new equity because of the dearth of buyers.  Stocks &lt;br /&gt;have gone through a decade in which their absolute return was negligible and their real return was &lt;br /&gt;negative.  They‟re selling below replacement value, showing how poor psychology is.  They face &lt;br /&gt;a litany of negatives, without any real possibility of relief; that‟s the writer‟s “nearly endless &lt;br /&gt;string of unhealthy things that have happened to the stock market over the past decade.” &lt;br /&gt;The negative factors are clear &lt;br /&gt;to the average investor.  And from them he draws negative &lt;br /&gt;conclusions.  But the person who applies logic and insight, rather than superficial views and &lt;br /&gt;emotion, sees something very different. &lt;br /&gt;He sees an asset class that is unloved.  He sees stocks that have cheapened for a decade – once &lt;br /&gt;dividends have been subtracted from the returns, and especially when prices are viewed relative &lt;br /&gt;to earnings.  He sees securities that are priced below the value of the underlying assets on which &lt;br /&gt;they have a claim.  He sees outflows of capital that, rather than being a negative, have lowered &lt;br /&gt;prices and can give rise to a strong price rebound when and if they reverse.  Most of all, he sees &lt;br /&gt;an asset class to which no optimism is being applied. &lt;br /&gt;If I were asked to &lt;br /&gt;name just one way to figure out whether something’s a bargain or not, it &lt;br /&gt;would be through assessing how much optimism is incorporated in its price.   &lt;br /&gt;No matter how good the fundamental outlook is for something, when investors apply too &lt;br /&gt;much optimism in pricing it, it won‟t be a bargain.  That was the story of the Internet bubble; &lt;br /&gt;the Internet was expected to change the world, and it did, but when the optimism surrounding &lt;br /&gt;it proved to have been excessive, stock prices were decimated. &lt;br /&gt;Conversely, no matter how bad the outlook is for an asset, when little or no optimism is &lt;br /&gt;incorporated in its price, it can easily be a bargain capable of providing outsized returns with &lt;br /&gt;limited risk.   &lt;br /&gt;Even with a bad “story,” the price of an asset is unlikely to decline (other than perhaps in the &lt;br /&gt;very short term) unless the story deteriorates further or the optimism abates.  And if there‟s &lt;br /&gt;no optimism built into its price, certainly the latter can‟t happen. &lt;br /&gt;It was primarily this line of reasoning that allowed me to feel positive in the teeth of the financial &lt;br /&gt;crisis in late 2008.  The outlook was as bad as it could get – total meltdown – and prices clearly &lt;br /&gt;incorporated zero optimism.  How, then, could buying be a mistake (providing the world didn‟t &lt;br /&gt;end)? &lt;br /&gt;In “The Tide Goes Out” (March 18, 2008), I described the three stages of a bear market.  The &lt;br /&gt;third stage occurs when everyone becomes convinced that things can only get worse.  Invariably &lt;br /&gt;this represents a great buying opportunity.  And certainly it was such a level of negativity that &lt;br /&gt;“The Death of Equities” documented. &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the insightful, unemotional, contrarian investor will read an article like “The Death of &lt;br /&gt;Equities” and conclude that things are about as bad as they can get.  And if things can‟t get worse, &lt;br /&gt;they‟ll probably get better eventually.  It‟s no more scientific than that.  If in mid-1979 people &lt;br /&gt;thought things could only get worse, there was no optimism to evaporate.  That meant the &lt;br /&gt;litany of negatives actually foreshadowed something very different: The Rebirth of Equities.  &lt;br /&gt;And that’s exactly what happened. &lt;br /&gt;The S&amp;P 500 gained &lt;br /&gt;18.4% in 1979, the year “The Death of Equities” was written, and went on &lt;br /&gt;to average 18.9% a year for the next 20 years.  There were only two down years during that span: &lt;br /&gt;a measly 4.9% in 1982 and 3.1% in 1990.  This has to have been the best 21-year period in the &lt;br /&gt;modern era.  Importantly, the stage had been set for this rise in 1979 by the accumulation &lt;br /&gt;and excessively pessimistic discounting of negatives. &lt;br /&gt;Way back in February 19&lt;br /&gt;93 – it would be yellowed by now, except that electronic copies don‟t &lt;br /&gt;turn yellow – I wrote a memo entitled “The Value of Predictions, or Where‟d All This Rain Come &lt;br /&gt;From?”  One of the things it discussed was the tendency of forecasters to extrapolate, especially &lt;br /&gt;when a trend has gone in one direction for a long time.  They tend to conclude it will go that way &lt;br /&gt;forever . . . and increasingly so just as it becomes more likely to revert to the mean.   &lt;br /&gt;In the memo, I me&lt;br /&gt;ntioned that California had undergone a five-year drought.  And that scientists &lt;br /&gt;had concluded from looking at ancient trees that a fifty-year drought couldn‟t be ruled out.  And &lt;br /&gt;that torrential rainstorms had begun just a few months later.   &lt;br /&gt;That‟s the way it goes.  As som&lt;br /&gt;ething goes in one direction for a while, people conclude &lt;br /&gt;increasingly that it always will . . . often just when the likelihood grows that it will reverse &lt;br /&gt;instead.  And that was the greatest shortcoming of “The Death of Equities.”  The extrapolator &lt;br /&gt;threw in the towel on stocks, just as the time was right for the contrarian to turn optimistic.  &lt;br /&gt;And it will always be so. &lt;br /&gt;Go Around, Come Around &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy with the benefit of hindsight to see that the writer of “The Death of Equities” was &lt;br /&gt;too negative at the bottom.  But being too negative isn’t the only pitfall.  Most people also &lt;br /&gt;tend to be too positive at the top. &lt;br /&gt;The bookend to “The Death of Equities” is the work published in the 1990s by Jeremy Siegel, a &lt;br /&gt;highly respected professor of finance at the Wharton School and the author of Stocks for the Long &lt;br /&gt;Run.  Through his work, Siegel showed that in almost two centuries, there had never been a 30-&lt;br /&gt;year period in which stocks didn‟t outperform cash, bonds and inflation, and very few such ten-&lt;br /&gt;year periods.  Based on the consistency of this record, Siegel labeled stocks very safe (as long as &lt;br /&gt;you hold them for the long run).  In fact, I heard him tell an audience that risk-averse investors &lt;br /&gt;should have 80-odd percent of their net worth in stocks, and risk-tolerant investors should have &lt;br /&gt;well over 100%. &lt;br /&gt;Siegel‟s research contributed to the fervor for equities that characterized the 1990s.  And as &lt;br /&gt;stocks did better, the appetite for them rose.  The period 1995-99 saw a compound average return &lt;br /&gt;of 28.6% on the S&amp;P 500, the greatest five years in history.  The ardor this reflected was &lt;br /&gt;explosive.  Arguments were advanced to the effect that stocks – and tech stocks in particular – &lt;br /&gt;could only rise, and that they had to rise faster than anything else. &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the enemy was extrapolation.  The average annual return had risen from about 10% for &lt;br /&gt;1929 to 1980, to 20.4% for 1980 to 1989, and to 28.6% for 1995 to 1999.  But investors drew the &lt;br /&gt;wrong conclusions, the inverse of those of “The Death of Equities”: they thought the good times &lt;br /&gt;could only roll on.  However: &lt;br /&gt;They forgot that in the long run the gains of stocks stem primarily from growth in corporate &lt;br /&gt;profits, and that profits don‟t grow anywhere near 20-30% a year. &lt;br /&gt;They ignored the possibility that the ultra-high returns of the 1990s had borrowed from future &lt;br /&gt;returns. &lt;br /&gt;They failed to wonder whether the adoration of stocks had lifted their prices to dangerous &lt;br /&gt;heights. &lt;br /&gt;They asked “What has been the historic return on stocks?” and bought based on the favorable &lt;br /&gt;answer.  But they didn‟t ask “What has been the historic return on stocks after they‟re risen &lt;br /&gt;almost 19% a year for 21 years?” or “What has been the historic return on stocks if bought at &lt;br /&gt;price/earnings ratios in the 30s?”  The answer to these latter questions would have been very &lt;br /&gt;different. &lt;br /&gt;Extrapolation was at the root of these omissions, disregarding the possibility that events had &lt;br /&gt;changed the environment and thus the outlook. &lt;br /&gt;What did I say about the drought and rain?  Of course, after stocks had done well enough in the &lt;br /&gt;1990s to encourage maximum bullishness and maximum allocations, their returns were primed &lt;br /&gt;for regression to the mean.  And so stocks lagged bonds for the first time in the thirty years &lt;br /&gt;ending late last year. &lt;br /&gt;What’s the lesson here?  Not that history always repeats, or that it never repeats.  And not &lt;br /&gt;that stocks can only do well or only do poorly.  But rather that the trends that lead up to a &lt;br /&gt;point in time have a profound effect on people’s thinking and on the environment, and thus &lt;br /&gt;on the trends that will occur thereafter. &lt;br /&gt; That price gains increase danger and price declines &lt;br /&gt;increase opportunity.  And that most investors and observers tend to be too positive at the &lt;br /&gt;top and too negative at the bottom.   &lt;br /&gt;These lessons are invaluable.  The stu&lt;br /&gt;dy of history makes them clear, just as ignorance of &lt;br /&gt;history makes them potentially lethal&lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;One More Round &lt;br /&gt;I‟m amazed at how often, just as I‟m about to complete a memo, I come across the right coda &lt;br /&gt;with which to bring it to an end.  This time I found it in The Wall Street Journal of March 12, just &lt;br /&gt;a day after I‟d started writing. &lt;br /&gt;In an article entitled “Why Stocks Are Riskier than You Think,” Zvi Bodie and Rachelle Taqqu &lt;br /&gt;go through – in my opinion – another Death of Equities-like recitation.  I won‟t discuss the article &lt;br /&gt;in depth, but I will point out some of its illogicalities: &lt;br /&gt;It says “despite the assurances of the financial industry, stocks are always a risky &lt;br /&gt;investment.”  This isn‟t very helpful.  The outlook for stocks is always uncertain, perhaps &lt;br /&gt;even risky, but it‟s essential to note that they aren‟t always equally&lt;br /&gt; risky.  They‟re riskier &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when valuations are high and prices embody great optimism, and they‟re much less risky &lt;br /&gt;when the reverse is true (see 1979). &lt;br /&gt;It says “the longer you hold [stocks], the better your chances of getting blindsided by a &lt;br /&gt;downturn.”  I find this highly misleading.  The longer you do anything, the better the chance &lt;br /&gt;that something bad will happen.  But that doesn‟t mean you shouldn‟t do it, or that it‟s safer &lt;br /&gt;to do it for just a short time.  Maybe the participant for a short period will time it just wrong &lt;br /&gt;and run straight into a bad patch.  And maybe by holding stocks for just a short time he‟ll &lt;br /&gt;miss out on the long-term benefits.  The question isn‟t whether something bad can happen to &lt;br /&gt;the long-term investor in equities, but what‟s likely to happen overall, &lt;br /&gt;considering good times &lt;br /&gt;as well as bad.  And whether, given his particular circumstances, an investor can survive the &lt;br /&gt;bad while waiting for the good to arrive. &lt;br /&gt;In deciding how much risk a prospective retiree can bear, the authors make reference to not &lt;br /&gt;wanting to see 2008-style losses of 30% to 40% ever again.  But using the worst time in &lt;br /&gt;generations to argue against investing in stocks is no better than using the best time to argue &lt;br /&gt;for it.  What matters isn‟t the best or worst possible outcome (or even the single most likely &lt;br /&gt;outcome).  What matters is the range of outcomes and their respective probabilities and &lt;br /&gt;consequences.  No one observation provides a very useful perspective. &lt;br /&gt;The strategy the authors spend the most time recommending is what‟s called a “zero-cost &lt;br /&gt;collar” where, for example, you buy an S&amp;P 500 ETF at $136, buy a put at $116 (ensuring &lt;br /&gt;against losses beyond that) and get the money with which to buy the put by selling a call at &lt;br /&gt;$143 (giving up any gains above that).  The good news is that one option pays for the other so &lt;br /&gt;the collaring is free, and that your downside is limited to 15%.  But the bad news is that to go &lt;br /&gt;with your maximum loss of 15%, you have a maximum gain of 6%.  I‟m not crazy about that &lt;br /&gt;tradeoff.  The benefits of the strategy seem largely illusory and the posture excessively &lt;br /&gt;defensive. &lt;br /&gt;This article isn‟t without merit.  My complaint is that it‟s simplistic – and the last thing that &lt;br /&gt;should be done regarding investing is to make it appear simple.  It‟s also biased to the negative &lt;br /&gt;side at a time when stocks appear reasonably situated. &lt;br /&gt;Stocks have returned almost nothing over the last twelve years. &lt;br /&gt;For the first time, the 30-year return on stocks has been below the return on bonds. &lt;br /&gt;The price of the S&amp;P 500 index is still 8% below its 2000 high, while its companies‟ earnings &lt;br /&gt;per share have nearly doubled over the intervening period. &lt;br /&gt;Thus the p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 is in the low double digits, a substantial discount from the &lt;br /&gt;post-World War II norm and down from the low 30s at the peak. &lt;br /&gt;Just as in 1979, institutional investors have lost interest in equities and are looking &lt;br /&gt;increasingly to alternatives.  The love affair with equities that ran from 1979 to 1999 seems to &lt;br /&gt;be over. &lt;br /&gt;Allocations to equities have been cut substantially in favor of bonds and alternatives.  For &lt;br /&gt;example, according to What I Learned This Week of March 15, “The ICI reports that $408 &lt;br /&gt;billion was redeemed from U.S. equity mutual funds between 2007 and 2011 and $792 billion &lt;br /&gt;was invested in U.S. bond funds in the same period.” &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story isn‟t as hopeless as it was in 1979, but it is uniformly negative.  Thus, while I don‟t &lt;br /&gt;expect an equity rally anything like what followed on the heels of “The Death of Equities,” I &lt;br /&gt;don‟t find it hard to conjure up positive scenarios. &lt;br /&gt;* *            * &lt;br /&gt;The media usually gets it wrong, and the pieces that get the most attention tend to be highly &lt;br /&gt;sensational and to get it the most wrong.  This is one of the many reasons why the deck is stacked &lt;br /&gt;against the average investor.  “The Death of Equities” would have gotten you out or kept you out &lt;br /&gt;of the stock market at very attractive levels in 1979.  Professor Siegel‟s work would have gotten &lt;br /&gt;you to increase your holdings at high prices in the 1990s.  And this new article argues against &lt;br /&gt;stocks at a time when valuations are below average, investors have turned against them, and &lt;br /&gt;companies are doing well. &lt;br /&gt;The great irony here is that the extrapolator actually thinks he‟s being respectful of history: he‟s &lt;br /&gt;assuming continuation of a trend that has been underway.  But the history that deserves his &lt;br /&gt;attention isn‟t the recent rise or fall of an asset‟s price, but rather the fact that most things &lt;br /&gt;eventually prove to be cyclical and tend to swing back from the extreme toward the mean. &lt;br /&gt;History amply demonstrates the tendency of investors and commentators alike to be &lt;br /&gt;pessimistic when the negatives collect, depressing prices, and optimistic when things are &lt;br /&gt;going well and prices are soaring.  The lessons of history are highly instructive.  Applying &lt;br /&gt;them isn’t easy, but they mustn’t be overlooked. &lt;br /&gt;March 19, 2012 &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to:     Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From:   Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: It’s All a Big Mistake &lt;br /&gt;Mistakes are a frequent topic of discussion in our world.  It’s not unusual to see investors &lt;br /&gt;criticized for errors that resulted in poor performance.  But rarely do we hear about mistakes as &lt;br /&gt;an indispensible component of the investment process.  I’m writing now to point out that &lt;br /&gt;mistakes are all that superior investing is about.  In short, in order for one side of a &lt;br /&gt;transaction to turn out to be a major success, the other side has to have been a big mistake. &lt;br /&gt;There’s an old saying in poker that there’s a “fish” (a sucker, or an unskilled player who’s likely &lt;br /&gt;to lose) in every game, and if you’ve played for an hour without having figured out who the fish &lt;br /&gt;is, then it’s you.  Likewise, in every investment transaction you’re part of, it’s likely that &lt;br /&gt;someone’s making a mistake.  The key to success is to not have it be you. &lt;br /&gt;Usually a buyer buys an asset because he thinks it’s worth more than the price he’s paying.  But &lt;br /&gt;the seller sells the asset because he thinks the price he’s getting exceeds its value.  It’s pretty safe &lt;br /&gt;to say one of them has to be wrong.  Strictly speaking, that doesn’t have to be true, thanks to &lt;br /&gt;differences in things like tax status, timeframe and investors’ circumstances.  But in general, &lt;br /&gt;win/win transactions are much less common than win/lose transactions.  When the dust has &lt;br /&gt;settled after most trades, the buyer and seller are unlikely to be equally happy. &lt;br /&gt;I consider it highly desirable to focus on the topic of investing mistakes.  First, it serves as a &lt;br /&gt;reminder that the potential for error is ever-present, and thus of the importance of mistake &lt;br /&gt;minimization as a key goal.  Second, if one side of every transaction is wrong, we have to ponder &lt;br /&gt;why we should think it’s not us.  Third, then, it causes us to consider how to minimize the &lt;br /&gt;probability of being the one making the mistake. &lt;br /&gt;Investment Theory on Mistakes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to the efficient market hypothesis, the efforts of motivated, intelligent, objective and &lt;br /&gt;rational investors combine to cause assets to be priced at their intrinsic value.  Thus there are no &lt;br /&gt;mistakes: no undervalued bargains for superior investors to recognize and buy, and no over-&lt;br /&gt;valuations for inferior investors to fall for.  Since all assets are priced fairly, once bought at &lt;br /&gt;fair prices they should be expected to produce fair risk-adjusted returns, nothing more and &lt;br /&gt;nothing less.  That’s the source of the hypothesis’s best-known dictum: you can’t beat the &lt;br /&gt;market. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve often discussed this definition of market efficiency and its error.  The truth is that while all &lt;br /&gt;investors are motivated to make money (otherwise, they wouldn’t be investing), (a) far from all &lt;br /&gt;of them are intelligent and (b) it seems almost none are consistently objective and rational.  &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, investors swing wildly from optimistic    to pessimistic – and from over-confident to &lt;br /&gt;terrified – and as a result asset prices can lose all connection with intrinsic value.  In addition, &lt;br /&gt;investors often fail to unearth all of the relevant inform&lt;br /&gt;ation, analyze it systematically, and step &lt;br /&gt;forward to adopt unpopular positions.  These are some of the elements that give rise to wh&lt;br /&gt;at &lt;br /&gt;are called “inefficiencies,” academics’ highfalutin word for “mistakes&lt;br /&gt;.” &lt;br /&gt;I absolutely believe that markets can be efficient – in the sense of “quick to incorporate &lt;br /&gt;information” – but certainly they aren’t sure to incorporate it correctly.  Underpricings and &lt;br /&gt;o&lt;br /&gt;verpricings arise all the time.  However, the shortcomings described in the paragraph just above &lt;br /&gt;render those mispricings hard to profit from.  While market prices are often far from “right,” it’s &lt;br /&gt;nearly impossible for most investors to detect instances when the consensus has done a faulty job &lt;br /&gt;of pricing assets, and to act on those errors.  Thus theory is quite right when it says the market &lt;br /&gt;can’t be beat . . . certainly by the vast majority of investors. &lt;br /&gt;People should engage in active&lt;br /&gt; investing only if they’re convinced that (a) pricing mistakes &lt;br /&gt;occur in the m&lt;br /&gt;arket they’re con&lt;br /&gt;sidering and (b) they – or the managers they hire – are capable of &lt;br /&gt;identifying those mistakes and taking advantage of them.  Unless both of those things are true, &lt;br /&gt;any time, effort, transaction costs and management f&lt;br /&gt;ees expended on active management will be &lt;br /&gt;wasted.  Active management has to be seen as the search for mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;Behavioral Sources of Investment Error &lt;br /&gt;As described above, investment theory asserts that assets sell at fair prices, and thus there’s no &lt;br /&gt;such thing as superior risk-adjusted performance.  But real-world data tells us that superior &lt;br /&gt;performance does exist, albeit far from universally.  Some people find it possible to buy things &lt;br /&gt;for less than they’re worth, at least on occasio&lt;br /&gt;n.  But doing so requires the cooperation of people &lt;br /&gt;who’re willing to sell things for less than they’re worth.  What m   akes them do that?  Why do &lt;br /&gt;mi&lt;br /&gt;stakes occur?  The new field of behavioral finance is all about looking into error stemming &lt;br /&gt;from emotion, psychology and cognitive limitations. &lt;br /&gt;If market prices were set by a “pricing czar” who was (1) tireless, (2) aware of all the facts, (3) &lt;br /&gt;proficient at analysis and (4) thoroughly rational and unemotional, assets could always be priced &lt;br /&gt;right based on the available information – never too low or too high.  In the absence of that czar, &lt;br /&gt;if a market were populated by investors fitting that description, it, too, could price assets &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;erfectly.   &lt;br /&gt;That’s what the efficient marketers theorize, but it’s just not the case.  Very few investors satisfy &lt;br /&gt;all four of the requirements listed above.  And when they fail, particularly at number four – being &lt;br /&gt;rational and unemotional – it seems they all err in the same direction at the same time.  That’s the &lt;br /&gt;reason for the herd behavior that’s behind bubbles and crashes, the biggest of all investment &lt;br /&gt;mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;According to the efficient market hypothesis, people study assets, assess their value and thereby &lt;br /&gt;decide whether to buy or sel&lt;br /&gt;l.  Given its current value and the outlook for change in that value, &lt;br /&gt;each asset’s current &lt;br /&gt;price implies a prospective return and risk level.&lt;br /&gt;  Market participants engage &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a continuous, instantaneous auction through which market prices are updated.  The goal is to &lt;br /&gt;set prices such that the relationship between each asset’s potential return and risk – that is, its &lt;br /&gt;prospective risk-adjusted return – is fair relative to all other assets.   &lt;br /&gt;Inefficiencies – mispricings – are instances when one asset offers a higher risk-adjusted return &lt;br /&gt;than another.  For example, A and B might seem equally risky, but A might appear to offer a &lt;br /&gt;higher return than B.  In that case, A is too cheap, and people will sell B (lowering its price, &lt;br /&gt;raising its potential return and reducing its risk) and buy A (raising its price, lowering its &lt;br /&gt;potential return and increasing its risk) until the risk-adjusted returns of the two are in line.  That &lt;br /&gt;condition is called “equilibrium.” &lt;br /&gt;It’s one of the jobs of a functioning market to eliminate opportunities for extraordinary &lt;br /&gt;profitability.  Thus market participants want to sell overpriced assets and buy underpriced assets.  &lt;br /&gt;They just don’t do so consistently.   &lt;br /&gt;Most investment error can be distilled to the failure to buy the things that are cheap (or to buy &lt;br /&gt;enough of them) and to sell the things that are dear.  Why do people fail in that way?  Here are &lt;br /&gt;just a few reasons: &lt;br /&gt;Bias or closed-mindedness&lt;br /&gt; – In theory, investors will shift their capital to anything that’s&lt;br /&gt;cheap, correcting pricing mistakes.  But in 1978, most investors wouldn’t buy B-rated&lt;br /&gt;bonds – at any price – because doing so was considered speculative and imprudent.  In&lt;br /&gt;1999, most investors refused to buy value stocks – also at any price – because they were&lt;br /&gt;deemed to lack the world-changing potential of technology stocks.  Prejudices like these&lt;br /&gt;prevent valuation disparities from being closed.&lt;br /&gt;Capital rigidity&lt;br /&gt; – In theory, investors will move capital out of high-priced assets and into&lt;br /&gt;cheap ones.  But sometimes, investors are condemned to buy in a market even though&lt;br /&gt;there are no bargains or to sell even at giveaway prices.  In 2000, in venture capital, there&lt;br /&gt;was “too much money chasing too few deals.”  In 2008, CLOs receiving margin calls had&lt;br /&gt;no choice but to sell loans at bankruptcy prices.  Rigidities like these create mispricings.&lt;br /&gt;Psychological excesses&lt;br /&gt; – In theory, investors will sell assets when they get too rich in a&lt;br /&gt;bubble or buy assets when they get cheap enough in a crash.  But in practice, investors&lt;br /&gt;aren’t all that cold-blooded.  They can fail to sell, for example, because of an&lt;br /&gt;unwarranted excess of optimism over skepticism, or an excess of greed over fear.&lt;br /&gt;Psychological forces like greed, fear, envy and hubris permit mispricings to go&lt;br /&gt;uncorrected . . . or become more so.&lt;br /&gt;Herd behavior&lt;br /&gt; – In theory, market participants are willing to buy or sell an asset if its&lt;br /&gt;price gets out of line.  But sometimes there are more buyers for something than sellers (or&lt;br /&gt;vice versa), regardless of price.  This occurs because of most investors’ inability to&lt;br /&gt;diverge from the pack, especially when the behavior of the pack is being rewarded in the&lt;br /&gt;short run.&lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foregoing goes a long way to support Yogi Berra’s observation that “In theory there is no &lt;br /&gt;difference between theory and practice.  In practice there is.”   &lt;br /&gt;Theory has no answer for the impact of these forces.  Theory assumes investors are clinical, &lt;br /&gt;unemotional and objective, and always willing to substitute a cheap asset for a dear one.  In &lt;br /&gt;practice, there are numerous reasons why one asset can be priced wrong – in the absolute &lt;br /&gt;or relative to others – and stay that way for months or years.  Those are mistakes, and &lt;br /&gt;superior investment records belong to investors who take advantage of them consistently. &lt;br /&gt;A Case In Point&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bruce Karsh and his distressed debt team have averaged returns of roughly 23% per year before &lt;br /&gt;fees and 18% after fees for more than 23 years without any use of borrowed capital.  All eighteen &lt;br /&gt;of their funds have been profitable, and money-losing years have been quite scarce.  I consider &lt;br /&gt;this record nothing short of aberrant.  You’re simply not supposed to be able to make that &lt;br /&gt;kind of return for that long, and especially without the use of leverage.  Investing skill aside, &lt;br /&gt;what made it possible? &lt;br /&gt;Is it because it’s called “distressed debt”?  That can’t be it; there’s nothing in a name.&lt;br /&gt;Is it because distressed debt is an undiscovered market niche?  That can’t be it either;&lt;br /&gt;distressed debt may have been little-known and under-appreciated when we raised our&lt;br /&gt;first fund in 1988.  But there can’t be many institutional investors who haven’t heard of&lt;br /&gt;distressed debt by now; certainly the secret’s out.&lt;br /&gt;Can it be because people are unwilling to venture into the sordid world of default and&lt;br /&gt;bankruptcy?  That might have been the case in the 1980s, but today most investors will&lt;br /&gt;do anything to make a buck.&lt;br /&gt;So, then, why?  I think it’s largely a matter of mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;At our London client conference in April, I listened as Bob O’Leary, a co-portfolio manager of &lt;br /&gt;our distressed debt funds, described his group’s work as follows: “Our business is often an &lt;br /&gt;examination of flawed underwriting assumptions.”  In other words, it’s their raison d’être to &lt;br /&gt;profit from the mistakes of others. &lt;br /&gt;Hearing Bob put it that way gave me the immediate inspiration for this memo.  The active &lt;br /&gt;investor only achieves above average performance to the extent that he can identify and act on &lt;br /&gt;mistakes others make.  The opportunities invested in by our distressed debt funds are a glaring &lt;br /&gt;example.  What’s the process through which the mistakes arise? &lt;br /&gt;The analysis performed by a company’s management, or the due diligence performed by&lt;br /&gt;a prospective acquirer, understates the stresses to which a business will be subjected&lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and/or overstates its ability to withstand them.  Using Bob’s terminology, they employ &lt;br /&gt;overly optimistic underwriting assumptions, particularly in good times. &lt;br /&gt;As a result, debt is piled on that turns out to be more than the company can service when&lt;br /&gt;things turn down.&lt;br /&gt;Just as companies and acquirers are often too optimistic in good times, debt holders tend&lt;br /&gt;to become too pessimistic in bad times.  As a result, they become willing to sell the debt&lt;br /&gt;of financially distressed companies at prices that overstate the negatives and thus are too&lt;br /&gt;low, giving us the potential for superior returns with less-than-commensurate risk.&lt;br /&gt;All three of these are foundational elements for success in distressed debt investing.   &lt;br /&gt;The first two contribute to the creation of high-potential-return situations.  If no one&lt;br /&gt;underestimated risk and thus overloaded capital structures with debt, there&lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t be many defaults and bankruptcies.  We call these lending decisions “the&lt;br /&gt;unwise extension of credit” or, alternatively, “stacking wood for the bonfire.”&lt;br /&gt;And if no one panicked in response to negative developments and scary prospects,&lt;br /&gt;and thus sold out too cheaply, there would be no reason to expect higher risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted returns from distressed debt than from anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the biggest mistakes made in the business and investment worlds have to do with &lt;br /&gt;cycles.  People extrapolate uptrends and downtrends into eternity, whereas the truth is that trends &lt;br /&gt;usually correct: rather than go well or poorly forever, most things regress to the mean.  The &lt;br /&gt;longer a trend has gone on – making it appear more permanent – the more likely it usually is that &lt;br /&gt;the time for it to reverse is near.  And the longer an uptrend goes on, the more optimistic, risk-&lt;br /&gt;tolerant and aggressive most people become . . . just as they should be turning more cautious. &lt;br /&gt;So, for example, when the economy is thriving and profits are rising, people conclude that &lt;br /&gt;company operations should be expanded, acquisitions should be undertaken, and more debt can &lt;br /&gt;be borne.  That same bullishness causes providers of debt to bestow larger amounts of money on &lt;br /&gt;weaker borrowers, at lower interest rates and with looser covenants.  Thus cycles are big &lt;br /&gt;sources of error, and pro-cyclical behavior is one of the biggest destroyers of capital. &lt;br /&gt;The point here is that one of distressed debt investing’s great advantages is that it embodies &lt;br /&gt;an anti-error business model.  Distressed debt investors . . . &lt;br /&gt;. . . almost never invest in companies where everything’s going well and investors are&lt;br /&gt;enthralled; there’s no such thing as a financially distressed company that everyone loves;&lt;br /&gt;. . . by definition rarely invest before the emergence of significant problems, hopefully&lt;br /&gt;meaning fewer negative surprises are left in the bag;&lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . are in business to buy debt at significant discounts, often from forced or highly&lt;br /&gt;motivated sellers.  “Distressed debt at par” is an oxymoron and, at least in theory,&lt;br /&gt;distressed debt investors are bargain hunters whose ardor rises as prices fall . . . not the&lt;br /&gt;reverse like so many other investors.&lt;br /&gt;It’s not that distressed debt investors can’t make mistakes; just that their likelihood of &lt;br /&gt;doing so is reduced by the very nature of their investment activity.  Anything that decreases &lt;br /&gt;an investor’s chance of erring – even an involuntary safety mechanism – works to his &lt;br /&gt;advantage. &lt;br /&gt;Distressed debt is, by definition, an area where: &lt;br /&gt;borrowers and lenders have made grave mistakes,&lt;br /&gt;at least some of those mistakes have come to light, and&lt;br /&gt;the stress, unpleasantness and uncertainty that attend a downturn often make debt holders&lt;br /&gt;sell out at the wrong time and price.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it’s an area where negativism and error are crystallized, maximized and &lt;br /&gt;magnified.  And nothing is more likely to make an asset too cheap than excessively negative &lt;br /&gt;psychology. &lt;br /&gt;When we’re out raising a new fund, investors often ask whether people have wised up such that &lt;br /&gt;they’ll no longer make these mistakes.  Thus far the answer has been no, and in fact there’s no &lt;br /&gt;reason to believe there’s been any progress at all up the learning curve.  The proof? &lt;br /&gt; The &lt;br /&gt;distressed debt opportunities that built up in 2005-07 and flowered in the crisis of 2008 were &lt;br /&gt;some of the best we’ve ever encountered, and certainly the most plentiful. &lt;br /&gt;One Classic Mistake &lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt; want to take this occasion to touch on a favorite thought of mine.  Investing consists of just one &lt;br /&gt;thing: choosing which assets to hold in order to profit in the future.  Thus there’s no getting away &lt;br /&gt;from the need to make decisions concerning the future. &lt;br /&gt;In deciding which future to prepare for, you need two things: (a) an opinion about what’s likely &lt;br /&gt;to happen and (b) a view on the probability that your opinion is right.  Everyone knows about the &lt;br /&gt;f&lt;br /&gt;ormer, but I think relatively few think about the latter.   &lt;br /&gt;In short, most people believe in their opinions.  “Of course they do,” you might say.  “If they &lt;br /&gt;didn’t have faith in their opinions, they wouldn’t hold them.”  And that’s the point.  Everyone’s &lt;br /&gt;entitled to his or her opinion.  But one of our favorite sayings around Oaktree states that &lt;br /&gt;“it’s one thing to have an opinion, and something very different to act as if it’s right.” &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, our opinions are our opinions because we believe them.  (We rarely hear anyone say &lt;br /&gt;“Here’s what I think, and I’m probably wrong.”)  But just as clearly, we believe (or should &lt;br /&gt;believe) more in some of our opinions than others.  The probability of being right about the &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weather tomorrow in California, a B-rated bond issuer paying its debts, and Greece being part of &lt;br /&gt;the European Union in three years is different in each case.  Few people would take issue with &lt;br /&gt;that. &lt;br /&gt;If that’s true, the reliance we place on each prediction – and the action we take in that reliance – &lt;br /&gt;should vary.  Yet, as I see it, most people who believe in forecasting come up with their &lt;br /&gt;opinions and then act on them with equal amounts of confidence.  This is one of the &lt;br /&gt;greatest sources of investment error.   &lt;br /&gt;It’s perfectly okay to say you don’t know something.  It’s also okay to say you have a view on &lt;br /&gt;what might happen but you’re not so sure you’re right.  In that case you’re likely to moderate &lt;br /&gt;your actions and emerge intact even if you turn out to be wrong.  As Mark Twain put it, “It ain’t &lt;br /&gt;what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.  It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”  &lt;br /&gt;Or as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told the 1999 graduating class of the University of &lt;br /&gt;Pennsylvania, “. . . understanding the difference between certainty and likelihood can make all &lt;br /&gt;the difference.”  Forecasting error is much less likely to prove fatal in the absence of excess &lt;br /&gt;conviction.   &lt;br /&gt;I’ve mentioned before the frequency with which I feel I come across a particularly apt quote just &lt;br /&gt;when I need it for a memo in the making.  Thus I’ll close this section with one on the present &lt;br /&gt;subject from Yaser Anwar’s “Exclusivo Listserv” of May 29: &lt;br /&gt;. . . while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few . . . admit the &lt;br /&gt;supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the &lt;br /&gt;examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable.  (John &lt;br /&gt;Stuart Mill, “On Liberty,” 1859) &lt;br /&gt;In o ther words, nearly everyone accepts that his or her opinion might be wrong . . . just not this &lt;br /&gt;time. &lt;br /&gt;A Big Mistake in the News &lt;br /&gt;A vast amount of ink and&lt;br /&gt; air time is being devoted to the subject of JP Morgan’s loss of m ultiple &lt;br /&gt;billions of dollars in its effort to hedge credit risk.  People – and especially politicians – have &lt;br /&gt;seized on the loss to prove that Jamie Dimon isn’t perfect and bank regulation is inadequate. &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, JP Morgan made a mistake – or more than one.  Jamie Dimon has described the hedge &lt;br /&gt;as “poorly designed,” “sloppy” and “a terrible, egregious mistake.”  How could that be the case – &lt;br /&gt;and how could the result be such an enormous loss – in a field as inherently defensive as &lt;br /&gt;hedging?  The answer’s simple: as Charlie Munger once said to me about investing, “It’s not &lt;br /&gt;supposed to be easy.  Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.”  The truth is, it’s hard to get it all right &lt;br /&gt;all the time, and that’s just as true of hedging as it is of investing.   &lt;br /&gt;Hedging sounds easy: you own some&lt;br /&gt;thing, so you sell something to lessen the impact if your &lt;br /&gt;investment performs badly.  But there are lots of ways to be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedging with the wrong thing.  Let’s say you own some A but don’t want to suffer the&lt;br /&gt;full impact if its price declines.  Why not just sell short an equal amount of A to hedge?&lt;br /&gt;The answer is that owning A and simultaneously shorting A is the same as not owning&lt;br /&gt;anything.  The long and short positions exactly offset each other, meaning you can’t&lt;br /&gt;make (or lose) any money.  That’s not hedging, that’s negating.&lt;br /&gt;You want to dampen fluctuations, not eliminate them.  So you hedge by selling short&lt;br /&gt;something you think will move in sympathy with A, but not exactly.  The hope is that by&lt;br /&gt;doing it very well, you can eliminate more of the risk of loss than you do of the potential&lt;br /&gt;for gain.  That’s the meaning of a “positive arbitrage.”&lt;br /&gt;Buying Ford stock and simultaneously shorting Ford accomplishes nothing.  So perhaps&lt;br /&gt;you buy Ford and short General Motors, which you think will perform less well, going up&lt;br /&gt;less than Ford or down more.  But by transacting in two different assets, you by definition&lt;br /&gt;introduce the possibility of an unfavorable divergence.  This is called “basis risk.”  In&lt;br /&gt;short, it’s the risk that the behavior of the two assets relative to each other will differ from&lt;br /&gt;what you expected.  For example, Ford goes down, giving you a loss, but rather than go&lt;br /&gt;down in sympathy (which would give you an offsetting gain on the short position), a&lt;br /&gt;favorable development at GM makes it go up, compounding your loss as the hedge goes&lt;br /&gt;against you.&lt;br /&gt;Hedging in the wrong amount.  You hold 1,000 Ford shares, and you think that – given&lt;br /&gt;their likely relative performance – you should short 500 GM shares to hedge your risk.&lt;br /&gt;But it turns out that while they move in opposite directions, their relative movements&lt;br /&gt;aren’t what you expected.  Thus you either hedged too much (and thus you lose more on&lt;br /&gt;the hedge than you make on the underlying position) or you hedged too little (so the&lt;br /&gt;protection you sought doesn’t materialize).  There’s no sure way to choose the right&lt;br /&gt;“hedge ratio.”&lt;br /&gt;Time risk.  The two sides of the position may work as you expect, but not when you&lt;br /&gt;expect.  Thus the hedge may fail to work in the short run, meaning the loss on one side of&lt;br /&gt;the hedge may occur before the gain on the other, in which case you’ll look flat-out&lt;br /&gt;wrong for a while.  And if you’re required (by regulation, margin call, capital&lt;br /&gt;withdrawals, etc.) to close out the position at that point, the result could be quite negative.&lt;br /&gt;Insufficient liquidity.  If conditions or goals change, you might want to adjust or remove&lt;br /&gt;your hedge.  But market developments in terms of liquidity might make it impossible to&lt;br /&gt;alter one or both sides of the position.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, hedging consists of an attempt to cede some potential gain in exchange for a &lt;br /&gt;g&lt;br /&gt;reater reduction in potential loss.  It’s a very reasonable course of action.  But it doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;necessarily have to work.   &lt;br /&gt;In attempting to set up effective hedges, there’s little choice but to extrapolate past relationships &lt;br /&gt;between things.  If they could be counted on to persist unchanged, there’d be little risk of being &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong about which asset to hedge with, how much to hedge, or whether the two sides of the &lt;br /&gt;hedge will move simultaneously.  But, just like everyone else in the investment world, would-be &lt;br /&gt;hedgers must understand that relationships that held in the past can’t be counted on to hold in the &lt;br /&gt;future. &lt;br /&gt;And let’s remember, as The New York Times wrote on May 26, “Yes, Morgan lost big – but, as &lt;br /&gt;Mitt Romney has pointed out, someone else won.”  That’s the bottom line on all investing.  &lt;br /&gt;There’s generally a right side and a wrong side to every investment.  Which will you be on? &lt;br /&gt;*            *            *&lt;br /&gt;Risk control isn’t an action so much as it is a mindset.  It stems largely from putting at least as &lt;br /&gt;much emphasis on avoiding mistakes as on doing great things.   &lt;br /&gt;Risk control – and consistent success in investing – requires an understanding of the fact that &lt;br /&gt;high returns don’t just come along for the picking; others must create them for us by making &lt;br /&gt;mistakes.  And looked at that way, we’ll do a better job if we force ourselves to understand the &lt;br /&gt;mistake we think is being made, and why. &lt;br /&gt;Risk control requires that we avoid the analytical and psychological errors to which others &lt;br /&gt;succumb. &lt;br /&gt;In particular, risk control requires that we temper our belief in our opinions with acceptance of &lt;br /&gt;our fallibility. &lt;br /&gt;In the end, superior investing is all about mistakes . . . and about being the person who &lt;br /&gt;profits from them, not the one who commits them. &lt;br /&gt;June 20, 2012 &lt;br /&gt;2012 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: The Outlook for Equities &lt;br /&gt;It doesn‟t take much to get me started on a memo.  In this case one sentence was enough, in an article &lt;br /&gt;from the February 4 online edition of Pensions &amp; Investments, as described by FierceFinance on &lt;br /&gt;February 28: “The long-term equity risk premium is typically between 4.5% and 5%.” &lt;br /&gt;There‟s little I hate more than &lt;br /&gt;investment generalizations.  For years, for example, self-styled authorities &lt;br /&gt;on the high yield bond market would say “bond defaults typically take place 2-3 years after issuance.”  &lt;br /&gt;That always set my teeth on edge.  The time to default might average 2-3 years, but unless (1) that‟s also &lt;br /&gt;the most common time period (the mode) and (2) not a highly variable parameter (which I think it is), that &lt;br /&gt;generalization is absolutely useless. &lt;br /&gt;In fact, I like the way Mark Twain summed up &lt;br /&gt;on the subject more than 100 years ago: “all &lt;br /&gt;generalizations are false, including this one.”  I consider most &lt;br /&gt;investment generalizations as useless as &lt;br /&gt;that great oxymoron: “common sense.”   &lt;br /&gt;Back to equity risk prem&lt;br /&gt;iums.  The FierceFinance article in question led with the sentence, “The „great &lt;br /&gt;rotation‟ back into equities from bonds is unlikely to be seen in 2013 among most defined benefit pension &lt;br /&gt;funds in major markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Netherlands.”  It included a number of what I &lt;br /&gt;consider p&lt;br /&gt;rovocative statements: &lt;br /&gt;that pension funds do want fewer bonds but generally not more stocks (raising the question of &lt;br /&gt;where the money will go, and specifically how much money can responsibly be absorbed in asset &lt;br /&gt;classes other than stocks and bonds), &lt;br /&gt;that, according to one consultant “There is recognition that bonds represent minimal-risk assets, &lt;br /&gt;so it‟s difficult for (plan executives) to abandon bonds in favor of equities. . .” (This overlooks the &lt;br /&gt;fact that there‟s no such thing as a minimal-risk asset regardless of price, and few assets that have &lt;br /&gt;been the beneficiaries of years of strong cash inflows can really be “minimal-risk”), and &lt;br /&gt;“that investors are taking short-term tactical advantage of the rising equity premium by, for &lt;br /&gt;example, allowing multiasset managers to drift toward the higher end of the equity allocation &lt;br /&gt;range.” &lt;br /&gt;So there we are, in the third bullet point, back to the matter of the equity risk premium. &lt;br /&gt;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Equity Risk Premiums (and Much More) &lt;br /&gt;The equity risk premium is generally defined as, “the excess return that an individual stock or the overall &lt;br /&gt;stock market provides over a risk-free rate.”  (Investopedia)  Thus it is the incremental return that &lt;br /&gt;investors in equities receive relative to the risk-free rate as compensation for bearing the risk involved.   &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term is also used to describe the extent to which the return on stocks exceeds the return on bonds, &lt;br /&gt;again as compensation for bearing incremental risk.  (For example, an August 18, 2011 article on the &lt;br /&gt;Seeking Alpha website, entitled “What the Equity Risk Premium Is Saying,” discusses the prospects for &lt;br /&gt;stocks versus the ten-year U.S. Treasury note.)   &lt;br /&gt;My real problem with the term – or, more correctly, the way it‟s used – has to do with one of the littlest &lt;br /&gt;words in the English language.  Or, to paraphrase a former President of the United States, “it all depends &lt;br /&gt;on the meaning of the word is.” &lt;br /&gt;Many people know what they think they mean when they talk about the existence and magnitude of the &lt;br /&gt;equity risk premium – or even what they actually mean – but I don‟t think many are logical or consistent &lt;br /&gt;in using it.  My complaints surround the definition they apply to the term, and specifically the tense of the &lt;br /&gt;verb they employ (I‟m not just being grammatically picky). &lt;br /&gt;Most specifically, I strongly dislike the use of the present tense, as exemplified by the writer for P&amp;I: &lt;br /&gt;“The long-term equity risk premium is typically between 4.5% and 5%.”  This suggests that the premium &lt;br /&gt;is something that solidly exists in a fixed amount and can be counted on to pay off in the future. &lt;br /&gt;Imagine instead that she had said “The long-term equity risk premium has typically been between 4.5% &lt;br /&gt;and 5%.”  This makes the premium seem more like a historical fact but also less dependable in the future &lt;br /&gt;(probably as it should be). &lt;br /&gt;The equity risk premium can actually be defined at least four different ways, I think: &lt;br /&gt;1.The historic excess of equity returns over the risk-free rate.&lt;br /&gt;2.The minimum incremental return that people demanded in the past to make them shift from the&lt;br /&gt;risk-free asset to equities.&lt;br /&gt;3.The minimum incremental return that people are demanding today to make them shift away from&lt;br /&gt;the risk-free asset and into equities.&lt;br /&gt;4.The margin by which equity returns will exceed the risk-free rate in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The four uses for the term are different and, importantly, all four are applied from time to time.  And I‟m &lt;br /&gt;sure the four uses are often confused.  Clearly the import of the term is very different depending on which &lt;br /&gt;definition is chosen.  The one that really matters, in my opinion, is the fourth: what will be the &lt;br /&gt;payoff from equity investing.  It’s also the one about which it’s least reasonable to use the word &lt;br /&gt;“is,” as if the risk premium is a fact. &lt;br /&gt;What Will Equities Give You? &lt;br /&gt;There are problems with at least three of the four meanings.  Only number one can be measured.  There‟s &lt;br /&gt;a lot of data on the historic performance of stocks versus bonds and cash.  In fact, in the 1990s Wharton &lt;br /&gt;Professor Jeremy Siegel documented to a fare-thee-well that stocks always won out over long periods of &lt;br /&gt;time.  &lt;br /&gt;Of course the subsequent decade proved that didn‟t have to remain the case. &lt;br /&gt;Now it gets more interesting.  Although we can calculate the amount by which stocks outperformed bonds &lt;br /&gt;or cash in the past (assuming you were looking at periods prior to 2000), I don‟t think that‟s the same as &lt;br /&gt;saying what risk premium was demanded by investors in the sense of definition number two above.  If &lt;br /&gt;stocks outperformed by 5% over a ten-year period, that doesn‟t mean people demanded a 5% higher &lt;br /&gt;return to buy equities rather than bonds or the risk-free asset.  They might have “demanded” more or less.  &lt;br /&gt;It‟s just that they got 5%. &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, we can also talk about number three, the minimum return increment people are &lt;br /&gt;demanding today.  But (a) the answer you come up with will depend on whom you ask, (b) they may or &lt;br /&gt;may not have given it rigorous thought, and (c) whatever they say is likely to have little impact on what &lt;br /&gt;relative returns turn out to be.  &lt;br /&gt;Their answer is likely to tell you more about what they think they‟ll get &lt;br /&gt;than about what they‟re actually demanding . . . or what they will get. &lt;br /&gt;What matters for today‟s investor isn‟t what stocks returned in the past, or what equity investors &lt;br /&gt;demanded in the past or think they‟re demanding today.  What matters is definition number four, what &lt;br /&gt;relative performance will be in the future.  The most important thing of all is to realize that this can’t &lt;br /&gt;be read anyplace.  As Einstein said, in one of my favorite quotes, “Not everything that counts can be &lt;br /&gt;counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”   &lt;br /&gt;Just as number four is the most important definition of the equity risk premium, the questions surrounding &lt;br /&gt;it are also significant.  In my view, people tend to think of the equity risk premium (and other risk &lt;br /&gt;premiums) like credit spreads on bonds.  I‟ve been dealing with credit spreads for 35 years.  They are the &lt;br /&gt;entire raison d'être for high yield bond investing.  And they have almost nothing in common with the &lt;br /&gt;equity risk premium. &lt;br /&gt;Let’s say we want to assess the ad&lt;br /&gt;equacy of the reward being offered for bearing the credit risk of a &lt;br /&gt;given B-rated high yield bond.  We compute the yield to maturity or yield to call on the bond and &lt;br /&gt;subtract from it the &lt;br /&gt;yield to maturity on a Treasury security of the same duration.  The result is the “yield &lt;br /&gt;spread” or “credit spread.”  That spread tells us what the prospective relative return is and – when &lt;br /&gt;asse&lt;br /&gt;ssed in the light of historic spreads, the spreads on other bonds, the riskiness of the bond in question, &lt;br /&gt;and the spreads on other bonds of similar, lesser or greater riskiness – whether the bond is rich or cheap. &lt;br /&gt;Now let’s apply the same process to a stock, or the stock market.  First, compute the prospective &lt;br /&gt;return on the stock.  Oh yeah; right.  There’s no way to do that.  Or rather there is, but it requires one &lt;br /&gt;to either (a) make an assumption about the growth rate of earnings per share to infinity or (b) make an &lt;br /&gt;assumption about the growth rate of earnings for a number of years and also the terminal p/e ratio that the &lt;br /&gt;market will apply to e.p.s. at the end of that period (which in turn will be a function of the growth of &lt;br /&gt;earnings from then to infinity).  In other words, a simple mathematical calculation will tell us exactly &lt;br /&gt;what the promised return on a bond is (albeit not the probability that it will be received), while &lt;br /&gt;coming up with the future return for a stock requires making some massive guesses about the far-&lt;br /&gt;off future.  That difference – in a nutshell – encapsulates a lot of the fundamental difference &lt;br /&gt;between investing in stocks and bonds. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: given that it‟s impossible to say with any accuracy what return a stock or the stock &lt;br /&gt;market will deliver, it‟s equally impossible to say what the prospective equity risk premium is.  The &lt;br /&gt;historic excess of stock returns over the risk-free rate may tell you the answer according to &lt;br /&gt;definition number one, with relevance depending on which period you choose, but it doesn’t say &lt;br /&gt;anything about the other three . . . and especially not number four: the margin by which equity &lt;br /&gt;returns will exceed the risk-free rate in the future. &lt;br /&gt;Another Call for Counter-Intuitiveness &lt;br /&gt;Many of the important things about investing are counterintuitive.  Low-quality assets can be safer than &lt;br /&gt;high-quality assets.  Things get riskier as they become more highly respected (and thus appreciate).  There &lt;br /&gt;can be more risk in thinking you know something than in accepting that you don‟t.  This counter-&lt;br /&gt;intuitiveness is a favorite theme of mine. &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the theme is importantly at work with regard to the equity risk premium, and especially P&amp;I‟s use of &lt;br /&gt;the term.  I take great issue with their statement “The long-term equity risk premium is typically between &lt;br /&gt;4.5% and 5%.”  That may be what it “was” or “has been,” but it doesn’t tell us anything about what &lt;br /&gt;it “is” or “will be.”  &lt;br /&gt;We know we can‟t extrapolate returns on bonds or the risk-free asset from the past; &lt;br /&gt;certainly changes in interest rates over the last five years mean investors in these things will enjoy far &lt;br /&gt;lower returns in the years ahead than they used to.  So then is it possible to know what we will get from &lt;br /&gt;equities?  Or from equities relative to bonds or the risk-free rate?  Clearly not.  Thus I think it’s &lt;br /&gt;dangerously misleading to say what the risk premium “is.”  That‟s probably enough on this subject. &lt;br /&gt;Let‟s move on to the final bullet point on page one and its reference to “the rising equity premium.”  The &lt;br /&gt;article discusses the case for an attractive equity risk premium in terms of definition number one – &lt;br /&gt;historically superior performance – since it goes on to point out that stocks outperformed bonds by an &lt;br /&gt;unusually large margin in the six months ended January 31, 2013 (11.23% for the Russell 3000 versus  &lt;br /&gt;-0.29% for the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index).  But do six months of good performance&lt;br /&gt;say anything about a rising equity premium?  And do they tell us anything at all about the future?&lt;br /&gt;Well, the answer to the first question lies in which definition you‟re following.  Of course the data tells us &lt;br /&gt;what the relative performance was (and 2012 was a great year, for example, with the S&amp;P 500 up roughly &lt;br /&gt;16% while the risk-less rate was close to zero).  An equity risk premium defined this way is certainly in &lt;br /&gt;the best part of the historic distribution.  But it tells us little about investors‟ past or present demanded &lt;br /&gt;returns.  And what does it say about the prospects for continued outperformance? &lt;br /&gt;To me, the answer is simple: th&lt;br /&gt;e better returns have been, the less likely they are – all other things &lt;br /&gt;being equal – to be good in the future.  Generally speaking, I view an asset as having a certain quantum &lt;br /&gt;of return potential over its lifetime.  The foundation for its return comes from its ability to produce cash &lt;br /&gt;flow.  To that base number we should add further return potential if the asset is undervalued and thus can &lt;br /&gt;be expected to appreciate to fair value, and we should reduce our view of its return potential if it is &lt;br /&gt;overvalued and thus can be expected to decline to fair value.   &lt;br /&gt;So – again all other things being equal – when the yearly return on an asset exceeds the rate at which it &lt;br /&gt;produces cash flow (or at which the cash flow grows), the excess of the appreciation over that associated &lt;br /&gt;with its cash flow should be viewed as either reducing the amount of its undervaluation (and thus &lt;br /&gt;reducing the expectable appreciation) or increasing its overvaluation (and thus increasing the price &lt;br /&gt;decline which is likely).  The simplest example is a 5% bond.  Let‟s say a 5% bond at a given price below &lt;br /&gt;par has a 7% expected return &lt;br /&gt;(or yield to maturity) over its remaining life.  If the bond returns 15% in the &lt;br /&gt;next twelve months, the expected return over its then-remaining life will be less than 7%.  An above-trend &lt;br /&gt;year has borrowed from the remaining potential.  The math is simplest with bonds (as always), but the &lt;br /&gt;principle is the same if you own stocks, companies or income-producing real estate. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, appreciation at a rate in excess of the cash flow growth accelerates into the present some &lt;br /&gt;appreciation that otherwise might have happened in the future.  Or to paraphrase Warren Buffett, “when &lt;br /&gt;people forget that corporate profits are unlikely to grow faster than 6% per year, they tend to get into &lt;br /&gt;trouble.”  I doubt he intended anything special about 6%, but rather a reminder that when assets &lt;br /&gt;appreciate faster than the rate at which their value grows, it isn‟t just a windfall but also a warning sign. &lt;br /&gt;Let‟s take a look at the 1990s, a decade full of lessons about equities.  As of 1990, the historic return on &lt;br /&gt;equities stood at 9% or 10%, and for that reason attitudes toward them were generally favorable, with that &lt;br /&gt;9-10% return expected to repeat in future decades.  But the ‟90s were a salutary period in terms of&lt;br /&gt;economic growth, corporate performance, technological and productivity gains, declining interest rates,&lt;br /&gt;low inflation and relative peace in the world (as well as naïve optimism regarding the benefits of a credit-&lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fueled expansion, the profit potential of e-commerce companies, and the extent to which equity gains &lt;br /&gt;could be perpetuated).  As a result, equity returns averaged 20% per year over the decade.   &lt;br /&gt;What was investors’ response?  They ratcheted up their expectations.  I believe by 2000 the &lt;br /&gt;professional consensus for future equity returns had risen from the 9-10% range to 11%.  A decade of the &lt;br /&gt;highest returns in history had convinced people that more good years lay ahead.  Few people seemed &lt;br /&gt;concerned that the extraordinary returns of the 1990s might have borrowed from the 2000s (as certainly &lt;br /&gt;seems to have been the case in retrospect).  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, just when stock prices were reaching levels they &lt;br /&gt;wouldn‟t see again for more than a decade, bonds were being dumped so that equity allocations could be &lt;br /&gt;expanded to all-time highs. &lt;br /&gt;When I look at the P&amp;&lt;br /&gt;I article, I see a statement that the equity risk premium is on the rise, but not a lot &lt;br /&gt;of reason why equities will do better in the future than they have in the past (or even specific mention of &lt;br /&gt;which past they‟ll do better than).  Extrapolation or analysis?  They’re two very different things. &lt;br /&gt;Valuing Stocks Today &lt;br /&gt;The underlying reason it took so little from FierceFinance to get me going on this memo is that I had a lot &lt;br /&gt;of pent-up thoughts about equities and their current valuation.  That‟s what the following pages will be &lt;br /&gt;spent on. &lt;br /&gt;Ironically given the extent to which I railed above about limiting the importance attached to the equity &lt;br /&gt;risk premium, some of the strongest arguments for stocks today surround their relative earning power.  In &lt;br /&gt;view of the difficulty in quantifying the prospective returns on stocks, appraising their value relative to &lt;br /&gt;bonds or the risk-free asset is often best done through comparing their yields. &lt;br /&gt;Since most companies pay out a modest percentage of their earnings, dividend yields greatly understate &lt;br /&gt;companies‟ ability to earn money for their shareholders, and thus for their stocks to appreciate.  A better &lt;br /&gt;measure of stocks‟ long-term potential may be found in their “earnings yield.”  The earnings yield is the &lt;br /&gt;reciprocal of the p/e ratio: the e/p ratio or ratio of earnings to price.  To gauge relative price-&lt;br /&gt;attractiveness, it isn‟t unreasonable to compare the earnings yield on a stock against the yield on a bond &lt;br /&gt;(or against the risk-free rate). &lt;br /&gt;Let‟s review a few data points:  &lt;br /&gt;If the post-WWII average p/e ratio on equities was something like 16 (for an e/p ratio of 1/16, or &lt;br /&gt;an earnings yield of about 6.25%) and if I guess at a “normal” risk-free rate of 3%, we get a &lt;br /&gt;historic yield differential – we might call it the equity risk premium, defined this way – of 3.25% &lt;br /&gt;(6.25% minus 3.00%), or 325 basis points.  The ratio between the yields was 6.25%/3.00%, or &lt;br /&gt;2.08x.    &lt;br /&gt;At the high in 2000, the p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 was more like 32 (for an e/p ratio of 1/32, or an &lt;br /&gt;earnings yield of 3.12%), and the 30-day T-bill rate was probably 2%.  In that case the yield &lt;br /&gt;differential or equity risk premium was a skimpy 1.12% (3.12% minus 2.00%), or 112 basis &lt;br /&gt;points, and the ratio of the two was only 3.12%/2.00%, or 1.56x.  In other words, stocks didn‟t &lt;br /&gt;offer enough relative to fixed income, and that‟s the main reason why they‟ve performed so &lt;br /&gt;poorly – both in absolute terms and relative to bonds – over the thirteen years since. &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are we today?  The p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 is back to about 16, meaning the earnings &lt;br /&gt;yield is 6.25&lt;br /&gt;% once again.  I‟ll use a 30-day T-bill rate of 1.00% (it‟s actually closer to zero, but a &lt;br /&gt;yield ratio approaching infinity wouldn‟t be meaningful).  That gives us a yield differential of &lt;br /&gt;5.25% (6.25% minus 1.00%), or 525 basis points, and a yield ratio of 6.25%/1.00%, or 6.25x. &lt;br /&gt;So let‟s recap: &lt;br /&gt;Post-WWII Norm 2000 Today &lt;br /&gt;Yield differential 325 b.p. 112 b.p. 525 b.p. &lt;br /&gt;Yield Ratio 2.08x 1.56x 6.25x &lt;br /&gt;Certainly the yield comparison is highly favorable for stocks today.  In fact it‟s one of the best in the last &lt;br /&gt;century (probably barring only the early 1980s, when the p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 fell to mid-single &lt;br /&gt;digits).  Is that the whole story?  It never is; nothing‟s that simple, especially in the world of investing.   &lt;br /&gt;The problem with basing a pro-equities argument on the yield comparison is that most of equities’ &lt;br /&gt;current attraction on that basis comes from the lowness of interest rates.  Just about everyone &lt;br /&gt;knows (a) interest rates are artificially low because of central banks’ efforts at stimulus and (b) &lt;br /&gt;rates will be considerably higher at some point in the intermediate term.  In that case, rising rates &lt;br /&gt;would render stocks less attractive (all other things being equal, but they‟re not – see below). &lt;br /&gt;The Other Pros and Cons of Equities &lt;br /&gt;There are many ways to view valuation, and many elements in the current debate over equities.  Here are &lt;br /&gt;a few of them (I‟ll start by reiterating the above for the sake of completeness): &lt;br /&gt;The differential between the S&amp;P earnings yield and the risk-free rate or the yields on bonds – &lt;br /&gt;and their ratio – makes stocks look extremely cheap.  PRO &lt;br /&gt;The attractiveness of these relative valuation parameters is highly dependent on interest rates &lt;br /&gt;staying low.  CON (or LESS PRO) &lt;br /&gt;Relative to normal post-WWII p/e ratios, stock prices are average to slightly low as a multiple of &lt;br /&gt;projected earnings for the year ahead.  PRO &lt;br /&gt;Robert Schiller‟s cycle-adjusted p/e ratios are gaining increased attention, and they suggest full &lt;br /&gt;rather than fair valuations.  CON &lt;br /&gt;Arguably earnings growth in the years ahead will be slower than that which prevailed in the &lt;br /&gt;decades following WWII.  Thus the post-war valuation norms are too high under the changed &lt;br /&gt;circumstances and should be discounted.  CON &lt;br /&gt;The outlook for earnings is restrained by the questionable macro environment, including the &lt;br /&gt;challenges in restarting growth and the dire prognosis for the federal deficit.  These problems may &lt;br /&gt;not be easily solved.  CON &lt;br /&gt;Among the things keeping earnings high – and thus making stocks seem attractive – are some of &lt;br /&gt;the highest profit margins in history.  If profit margins were to move toward normal levels, this &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would bring down earnings, either taking stock prices down with them or lifting p/e ratios and &lt;br /&gt;thus reducing stocks‟ attractiveness.  CON &lt;br /&gt;Corporate cash hoards are high, implying some combination of safety, potential for stock &lt;br /&gt;buybacks, and possible dividend increases.  These are all good for shareholders.  PRO &lt;br /&gt;Investor attitudes toward stocks remain tepid (see below).  PRO &lt;br /&gt;However, with the S&amp;P 500 up 16% last year and 10% so far this year, it can‟t be argued that &lt;br /&gt;stocks have been overlooked and or that attitudes towards them are still mired in the doldrums.  &lt;br /&gt;CON &lt;br /&gt;The Role of Investor Attitudes &lt;br /&gt;I covered this subject at length in “Déjà Vu All Over Again” (March 19, 2012).  I‟m not going to drag &lt;br /&gt;you through it again, but I will copy over parts of that memo from a year ago: &lt;br /&gt;. . . people have been throwing in the towel and selling stocks.  Other things have come &lt;br /&gt;into vogue, attracting the capital that used to be invested in stocks.  Mutual fund investors &lt;br /&gt;have turned their attention elsewhere. . . .  Stocks have gone through a decade in which &lt;br /&gt;their absolute return was negligible and their real return was negative. . . .  They face a &lt;br /&gt;litany of negatives, without any real possibility of relief . . . &lt;br /&gt;The negative factors are clear to the average investor.  And from them he draws negative &lt;br /&gt;conclusions.  But the person who applies logic and insight, rather than superficial views &lt;br /&gt;and emotion, sees something very different. &lt;br /&gt;He sees an asset class that is unloved.  He sees stocks that have cheapened for a decade – &lt;br /&gt;once dividends have been subtracted from the returns, and especially when prices are &lt;br /&gt;viewed relative to earnings.  He sees securities that are priced below the value of the &lt;br /&gt;underlying assets on which they have a claim.  He sees outflows of capital that, rather &lt;br /&gt;than being a negative, have lowered prices and can give rise to a strong price rebound &lt;br /&gt;when and if they reverse.  Most of all, he sees an asset class to which no optimism is &lt;br /&gt;being applied. . . . &lt;br /&gt;The thing to notice about the preceding paragraphs is that when I wrote them a year ago, I &lt;br /&gt;didn’t do so to describe then-current market conditions.  Rather, I was trying to capture &lt;br /&gt;conditions as they were in 1982, when BusinessWeek magazine carried a cover story &lt;br /&gt;trumpeting “The Death of Equities.”  My point was that in 1982, overly negative investors &lt;br /&gt;were fixated on the reasons for continued lethargy on the part of stocks, just when the scene was &lt;br /&gt;set for the greatest upsurge in stock market history. &lt;br /&gt;. . . As something goes in one direction &lt;br /&gt;for a while, people conclude increasingly that it &lt;br /&gt;always will . . . often just when the likelihood grows that it will reverse instead.  And that &lt;br /&gt;was the greatest shortcoming of “The Death of Equities.”  The extrapolator threw in &lt;br /&gt;the towel on stocks, just as the time was right for the contrarian to turn optimistic.  &lt;br /&gt;And it will always be so. &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‟t think last year that the extent of the undervaluation was anywhere as great as it had been in 1982, &lt;br /&gt;but I did think the conditions were similar in kind.  Nothing sets the stage for an upturn as well as &lt;br /&gt;excessive negativism – or at minimum excessive disinterest.  And that‟s what I sensed in the stock market &lt;br /&gt;last year, following on the heels of a twelve-year malaise.  Thus I don‟t consider it a freak occurrence that &lt;br /&gt;stocks all around the world went on to have an excellent year in 2012.   &lt;br /&gt;Many conditions remain similar . . . again, in kind.  Equity mutual funds are seeing only modest &lt;br /&gt;inflows, albeit the outflows have stopped.  Even though they’ve appreciated, stocks still aren’t &lt;br /&gt;highly valued.  Many institutions have allocations to equities that are well below the average of the &lt;br /&gt;last fifty years, and no one’s rushing to move them up.  In other words, I’m comfortable saying &lt;br /&gt;attitudes toward equities are characterized by relative disinterest and apathy. &lt;br /&gt;This is certainly something th&lt;br /&gt;at can turn.  If it turns, it can have a significant impact.  And what is most &lt;br /&gt;likely to turn it?  It won‟t necessarily take a “grand bargain” in Washington to solve the nation‟s fiscal &lt;br /&gt;problems, or a sudden rebirth of economic growth worldwide, or the invention of the next iPhone.  All &lt;br /&gt;that‟s required is another good year or two for stocks and a switch in investor psychology from “stocks &lt;br /&gt;are unlikely to do anything but extend the „lost decade‟ ” to “hey, I‟m afraid I might not be positioned &lt;br /&gt;adequately to participate in the next bull market.”   &lt;br /&gt;A move upward can be powered by a switch from the fear of losing money to the fear of missing &lt;br /&gt;opportunity.  When attitudes are moderate and allocations are low, it doesn’t take much. &lt;br /&gt;*   *            * &lt;br /&gt;In the mid-1970s I was fortunate to happen upon one of the first of the time-worn pearls of wisdom that &lt;br /&gt;contributed so much to my education as an investor.  It described the three stages of a bull market:   &lt;br /&gt;the first, when a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get better, &lt;br /&gt;the second, when most investors realize improvement is actually underway, and &lt;br /&gt;the third, when everyone‟s sure things will get better forever. &lt;br /&gt;In “The Tide Goes Out,” written in March 2008, several months before the lows of the financial crisis, I &lt;br /&gt;applied the same thinking to the converse – the three stages of a bear market: &lt;br /&gt;the first, when just a few prudent investors recognize that, despite the prevailing bullishness, &lt;br /&gt;things won‟t always be rosy, &lt;br /&gt;the second, when most investors recognize things are deteriorating, and &lt;br /&gt;the third, when everyone‟s convinced things can only get worse. &lt;br /&gt;Hindsight always makes it clear what was going on at a particular point in time.  It‟s a snap now to say &lt;br /&gt;the second quarter of 2007 marked the third stage of a bull market: no one could think of a way to lose &lt;br /&gt;money.  And in the fourth quarter of 2008 (for credit) and the first quarter of 2009 (for equities), we were &lt;br /&gt;certainly in the third stage of a bear market: most people thought the financial system was about to &lt;br /&gt;collapse, and securities that had halved in price could do nothing but halve again. &lt;br /&gt;But the study of market history only makes us better investors if it teaches us how to assess &lt;br /&gt;conditions as they are, rather than in retrospect.  &lt;br /&gt;When I wrote “Déjà Vu All Over Again” a year ago, &lt;br /&gt;it was my feeling that equities were in the first stage of a bull market.  Experience had been so bad for so &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;long – and the level of disinterest was so high – that only a few investors thought equities could ever &lt;br /&gt;catch on again.  Those low expectations, when combined with modest fundamental and psychological &lt;br /&gt;improvement, gave the S&amp;P 500 a return of about 13% over the year since that memo was written. &lt;br /&gt;So now we have a somewhat improved fundamental environment, a generally more optimistic group of &lt;br /&gt;investors, and stock prices that are a fair bit higher.  No one should say the likelihood of improvement &lt;br /&gt;is entirely unrecognized today, as would have to be the case for this to still be stage one.  I think the &lt;br /&gt;existence of improvement is generally accepted, but that acceptance is neither extremely &lt;br /&gt;widespread nor terribly overdone.  Thus I’d say we’re somewhere in the first half of stage two.  &lt;br /&gt;Pessimists no longer control market prices, but certainly neither have carefree optimists taken over.   &lt;br /&gt;*   *            * &lt;br /&gt;A great rotation?  Maybe . . . or maybe not.  Nowadays pundits and the media are quick to come up &lt;br /&gt;with cute labels – usually just the right size for a headline or sound bite – to describe things that are taking &lt;br /&gt;place or that “everyone knows” are just around the corner.  I don’t know whether it’s going to be great.  &lt;br /&gt;Heck, I don’t even know if it’ll happen.  But I like to enumerate the pros and cons and try to put them in &lt;br /&gt;perspective, as much as I like skewering excessive generalizations and pat pronouncements. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, doing that isn‟t enough.  I feel I should come down on one side or the other.  Thus I’m quite &lt;br /&gt;comfortable imagining a few years of equity performance that provide a pleasant surprise relative &lt;br /&gt;to what I think is the prevailing expectation of 6% or so per year.   &lt;br /&gt;And if I‟m wrong – if there is no rotation from fixed income to stocks – I‟m not that worried that I‟ll end &lt;br /&gt;up with great regret over having failed to pile into T-bills yielding zero or the 10-year note guaranteeing &lt;br /&gt;2.0%.  When attitudes are moderate and allocations are low, like I feel is currently the case with equities, &lt;br /&gt;there‟s little likelihood of investing being a big mistake.  &lt;br /&gt;And when interest rates are among the lowest in &lt;br /&gt;history, it would take deflation, depression or calamity to make failing to invest in Treasurys and high &lt;br /&gt;grade bonds a serious omission. &lt;br /&gt;March 13, 2013 &lt;br /&gt;2013 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Getting Lucky &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes these memos are inspired by a single event or just one thing I read.  This one – like my first &lt;br /&gt;memo 24 years ago – grew out of the juxtaposition of two observations.  I’ll introduce one here and the &lt;br /&gt;other on page seven.  Contrary to my wife Nancy’s observation that my memos are “all the same,” the &lt;br /&gt;subject here is one I’ve rarely touched on. &lt;br /&gt;The Role of Luck &lt;br /&gt;The first inspiration for this memo came in early November, when I picked up a copy of the Four Seasons &lt;br /&gt;Magazine in my hotel room in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  I happened to turn to an arti&lt;br /&gt;cle entitled “In Defence &lt;br /&gt;of Luck” by Ed Smith.  It’s been in my Oaktree bag ever since.  In his two opening paragraphs, Smith &lt;br /&gt;presents a thesis for dismantling: &lt;br /&gt;“Success is never accidental,” Twitter founder Jack Dorsey recently tweeted.  No &lt;br /&gt;accidents, just planning; no luck, only strategy; no randomness, just perfect logic. &lt;br /&gt;It is a tempting executive summary for a seductive speech or article.  If there are no &lt;br /&gt;accidents, then winners are seen in an even better light.  Denying the existence of luck &lt;br /&gt;appeals to a fundamental human urge: to understand, and ultimately control, everything &lt;br /&gt;in our path.  Hence the popularity of the statement “You make your own luck.” &lt;br /&gt;That’s all it took to get my juices flowing.  I – along with Smith – believe a great many things &lt;br /&gt;contribute to success.  Some are our own doing, while many others are beyond our control.  There’s &lt;br /&gt;no doubt that hard work, planning and persistence are essential for repeated success.  These are among the &lt;br /&gt;contributors that Twitter’s Dorsey is talking about.  But even the hardest workers and best decision &lt;br /&gt;makers among us will fail to succeed consistently without luck. &lt;br /&gt;What are the components of luck?  They range from accidents of birth and genetics, to chance meetings &lt;br /&gt;and fortuitous choices, and even to perhaps-random but certainly unforeseeable events that cause &lt;br /&gt;decisions to turn out right. &lt;br /&gt;In discussing the existence and importance of luck, Smith cites the popular book Outliers by Malcolm &lt;br /&gt;Gladwell: &lt;br /&gt;Attacking luck has never been more fashionable.  No matter how flimsy the science &lt;br /&gt;behind the theory, popularized by author Malcolm Gladwell, that success must follow &lt;br /&gt;from 10,000 hours of dedicated practice, it has hardened into folklore. &lt;br /&gt;Outliers is bes&lt;br /&gt;t known for Gladwell’s observation that it’s this magic number of hours of practice that &lt;br /&gt;makes the di&lt;br /&gt;fference for those who are most successful.  But that’s only part of Gladwell’s message, and &lt;br /&gt;people who think his book is all about hard work and practice miss the point.  Having set out the “10,000-&lt;br /&gt;hours” thesis, Gladwell largely stops talking about it and turns to spend much more time on something he &lt;br /&gt;calls “demographic luck.&lt;br /&gt;”  This is actually the antithesis of an insistence that hours of effort suffice. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographic Luck &lt;br /&gt;Gladwell’s term for this key ingredient in success has a simpler everyday label: “being born at the right &lt;br /&gt;time and the right place.”  Gladwell’s examples are compelling: &lt;br /&gt;By the time the first hockey tryouts take place for all the little Canadian boys born in a given&lt;br /&gt;calendar year, those born in January will be eleven months older –&lt;br /&gt; and thus much bigger and&lt;br /&gt;stronger and more coordinated – than those born in December.  They’re likely to be put on better&lt;br /&gt;teams, receive better coaching, and spend more time on the ice.  They’re more likely to get&lt;br /&gt;10,000 hours of practice and – all other things equal – to have their skills honed and showcased.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to college in the mid-sixties, we inputted computer projects via punch cards; they&lt;br /&gt;ran overnight; and we went back for our results the next morning.  But going to a private high&lt;br /&gt;school a few years later enabled Bill Gates to enter his work via a time-sharing terminal&lt;br /&gt;connected directly to a central computer, and to see the results in real time.  Thus he could&lt;br /&gt;perform hundreds of iterations a week, not seven, and develop his skills and his ideas much&lt;br /&gt;faster.  In addition, the University of Washington was a short bus ride from his home, and his&lt;br /&gt;family’s contacts enabled him to use its computer lab.&lt;br /&gt;When Joe Flom and his &lt;br /&gt;Jewish cohorts graduated from law school in the 1930s, there were no&lt;br /&gt;jobs for them with prestigious Wall Street law firms.  They formed their own firm, Skadden,&lt;br /&gt;Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, but their work was largely confined to matters the “white shoe”&lt;br /&gt;firms rejected as unseemly and disreputable.  Thus when proxy fights and hostile takeovers&lt;br /&gt;became commonplace in the 1970s and ’80s, Joe Flom had superior experience and became a&lt;br /&gt;leader in advising on them, earning multi-million dollar fees.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like more than a coincidence that not only was Bill Gates born in 1955, but his Microsoft co-&lt;br /&gt;founder Paul Allen was born in 1953; Sun Microsystems founders Bill Joy and Scott McNealy were born &lt;br /&gt;in 1954; Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt were born in 1955; and Steve Ballmer was born in 1956.  Ten years &lt;br /&gt;earlier and there would have been no remote computer terminals for them to work at in high school and &lt;br /&gt;college; ten years later and the kids born before them would have beat them to the “new, new thing.” &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the greatest pioneers of the M&amp;A bar were born at the right time to benefit from the upsurge in &lt;br /&gt;corporate activities that the legal establishment had frowned upon: Joe Flom in 1923 and all four founders &lt;br /&gt;of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz in 1930-31.  &lt;br /&gt;During the holi&lt;br /&gt;days, I enjoyed spending time with three legends of the pop music business: producer &lt;br /&gt;David Geffen, entertainment attorney Allen Grubman, and Robbie Robertson, leader of the group “The &lt;br /&gt;Band.”  I was struck by the f&lt;br /&gt;act that they were all born in the same year: 1943.  I came along three years &lt;br /&gt;later, and I remember my parents picking me up from summer camp in 1956 and telling me about a new &lt;br /&gt;singing sensation, Elvis Presley, and a new kind of music called rock and roll.  The three men listed above &lt;br /&gt;were born at the right time to become leaders of the newly minted rock and roll industry.  It’s a good &lt;br /&gt;thing they weren’t born a few decades later, since cheap downloads and file sharing have now decimated &lt;br /&gt;the profitability of the record business. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is simple: it’s great to be in the vanguard of a new development.  Talent and hard &lt;br /&gt;work are essential, but there’s nothing like getting there early and being pushed ahead by the powerful &lt;br /&gt;trends in demographics and taste that follow. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the ultimate description of demographic luck comes from Warren Buffett: &lt;br /&gt;I’ve had it so good in this world, you know.  The odds were fifty-to-one against me being &lt;br /&gt;born in the United States in 1930.  I won the lottery the day I emerged from the womb by &lt;br /&gt;being in the United States instead of in some other country where my chances would &lt;br /&gt;have been way different. &lt;br /&gt;Imagine there are two identical twins in the womb, both equally bright and energetic.  &lt;br /&gt;And the genie says to them, “One of you is going to be born in the United States, and one &lt;br /&gt;of you is going to be born in Bangladesh.  And if you wind up in Bangladesh, you will &lt;br /&gt;pay no taxes.  What percentage of your income would you bid to be the one that is born &lt;br /&gt;in the United States?”  It says something about the fact that society has something to do &lt;br /&gt;with your fate and not &lt;br /&gt;just your innate qualities.  The people who say, “I did it all &lt;br /&gt;myself,” and think of themselves as Horatio Alger – believe me, they’d bid more to be in &lt;br /&gt;the United States than in Bangladesh.  That’s the Ovarian Lottery.  (The Snowball, Alice &lt;br /&gt;Schroeder) &lt;br /&gt;Buffett is insightful enough to realize – and secure enough to admit – that he isn’t solely responsible for &lt;br /&gt;his success.  What if he’d been born in Bangladesh instead of the U.S.?  Or a woman rather than a man in &lt;br /&gt;1930, having much fewer opportunities?  Or in 1830 (when there would be no hedge fund industry for a &lt;br /&gt;century) or 2014 (when there are smart people crawling all over it)?  Or to different parents?  Or if he’d &lt;br /&gt;missed out on studying under Ben Graham at Columbia?  Or if he hadn’t partnered with Charlie Munger? &lt;br /&gt;I’m impressed when people credit others – as well as luck – for the essential part they played in their &lt;br /&gt;accomplishments.  And I agree 100% with the following sentiment from Smith’s article: &lt;br /&gt;Michael Young, the &lt;br /&gt;sociologist who coined the term “meritocracy,” described the danger &lt;br /&gt;of thinking that success must be deserved just because it has happened: “If meritocrats &lt;br /&gt;believe, as more and more of them are encouraged to, that their advancement comes from &lt;br /&gt;their own merits . . . they can be insufferably smug.”  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;Did You Do It All Yourself? &lt;br /&gt;Buffett’s mention of “people who say, ‘I did it all myself’ ” reminds me of one of President Obama’s &lt;br /&gt;reelection campaign speeches, which included a comment that became a lightning rod: “If you’ve got a &lt;br /&gt;business – you didn’t build that.  Somebody else made that happen.” &lt;br /&gt;His remark serves quite poorly when taken on its own.  It suggests he thinks that there’s no such thing as &lt;br /&gt;individual success, only group accomplishments.  It denies the efficacy of hard work and grit.  In short, it &lt;br /&gt;reflects a very un-American view of success. &lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to be&lt;br /&gt; sure that every sentence we speak or write can stand on its own.  When taken in context, &lt;br /&gt;Obama’s statement makes more sense: &lt;br /&gt;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.  There was a great &lt;br /&gt;teacher somewhere in your life.  Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American &lt;br /&gt;system that we have that allowed you to thrive.  Somebody invested in roads and bridges. &lt;br /&gt;If you’ve got a business – you didn’t build that. &lt;br /&gt; Somebody else made that happen. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly Obama omitted a few key words from those two last sentences, perhaps assuming his listeners &lt;br /&gt;would carry them over from those that went before.  The addition of just four words (italicized below) &lt;br /&gt;would have made his message more palatable: “If you’ve got a business – you didn’t build that alone.  &lt;br /&gt;Somebody else provided assi&lt;br /&gt;stance that made that happen.” &lt;br /&gt;In other words, you were lucky enough to get help.  Weren’t we all? &lt;br /&gt;Did I Do It All Myself? &lt;br /&gt;You may think of me as intelligent, insightful and/or hard-working.  I hope you do.  But when I finished &lt;br /&gt;reading Outliers, I was moved to write down for my kids all &lt;br /&gt;the ways in which demographic luck &lt;br /&gt;contributed to my success.  To illustrate my point, I want to share the list with you: &lt;br /&gt;First of all&lt;br /&gt;, it was great to be born in America at the very beginning of the “baby boom.”  Baby&lt;br /&gt;boomers – the generation born right after World War II – benefitted from the return of&lt;br /&gt;servicemen from the war; the ending of war-time limits on consumption; and explosive&lt;br /&gt;subsequent growth of the population, which fired strong economic growth.  I was conceived&lt;br /&gt;during the war and born just after it ended.  You couldn’t get much closer to the front of the line.&lt;br /&gt;I was born to middle-class parents – members of the first generation in their families to be born in&lt;br /&gt;America – who encouraged me in education and work.  They made me the first member of our&lt;br /&gt;family to receive a college degree.&lt;br /&gt;The timing of my birth enabled me to get a good, free education in the New York City public&lt;br /&gt;schools.  The schools benefitted from the presence of smart women teachers to whom corporate&lt;br /&gt;careers weren’t available, and who liked being on the same vacation schedule as their kids.&lt;br /&gt;My high school guidance counselor said my grades weren’t good enough to get me into Wharton,&lt;br /&gt;but I was lucky to have had an accounting teacher whose letter of recommendation may have&lt;br /&gt;done the trick.  Or perhaps it was the college entrance exams or SATs, standardized tests that had&lt;br /&gt;been introduced shortly before to counter the elite universities’ bias against public-school kids.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of w&lt;br /&gt;hat made &lt;br /&gt;it possible, it’s clear that attending Wharton taught me a lot, exposed&lt;br /&gt;me to finance (previously I had planned on a career in accounting) and burnished my resume.&lt;br /&gt;Would my career, and thus my life, have been the same if I hadn’t gotten into Wharton and&lt;br /&gt;instead had attended my second-choice school, a large state university?&lt;br /&gt;When I went off to college, I’d never heard of something called an MBA.  But the existence of&lt;br /&gt;the Vietnam War provided an incentive to stay in school, and three years for law school seemed&lt;br /&gt;like too much, so business school it would be.  Turned down by Harvard because of my lack of&lt;br /&gt;work experience, I instead attended the University of Chicago, whose theoretical, quantitative&lt;br /&gt;approach provided the perfect complement to my pragmatic Wharton undergraduate education.&lt;br /&gt;Just as I was luck&lt;br /&gt;y to be at the front of the line of baby boomers, my timing was fortuitous in&lt;br /&gt;attending Chicago.  I arrived on campus in 1967, just a few years after the new Chicago approach&lt;br /&gt;to finance had begun to be taught.  No more than a few hundred students could have beat me to&lt;br /&gt;the capital asset pric&lt;br /&gt;ing model, modern portfolio theory, the efficient market hypothesis, the&lt;br /&gt;random walk, and the other components of today’s investment theory.&lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not one of those investors who started reading prospectuses at age ten.  In fact, even as I&lt;br /&gt;approached graduation from Chicago in 1969, I was unsure of my career direction.  I accepted a&lt;br /&gt;permanent position in investment research at First National City Bank (the predecessor of&lt;br /&gt;Citibank), largely because I’d had a good summer job there a year earlier.  Ten years in equity&lt;br /&gt;analysis there, including three as director of research, provided an ideal foundation for my&lt;br /&gt;investment career.&lt;br /&gt;And then, when a new chief investment officer wanted to make room for his own head of&lt;br /&gt;research in 1978, he asked me to start up funds in convertible bonds and – in the ultimate stroke&lt;br /&gt;of luck –&lt;br /&gt; the newly created field of high yield bonds.  How could anyone have been better&lt;br /&gt;positioned to participate in the financial developments of the last 35 years?&lt;br /&gt;And of course, I was at my luckiest when I teamed up with my wonderful partners – Bruce Karsh,&lt;br /&gt;Sheldon Stone, Larry Keele and Richard Masson – between 1983 and 1988.  Bruce had the idea&lt;br /&gt;to organize a fund to invest in “distressed debt” at TCW, the first one from a mainstream financial&lt;br /&gt;institution.  And then the five of us left to start Oaktree in 1995.  The rest, as they say, is history.&lt;br /&gt;You make your own luck?  Success is never accidental?  Bull!!  I contributed to some of the positive &lt;br /&gt;developments described above, but many of them were pure luck.  Pull out a few of the steps on this &lt;br /&gt;progression, and where would I be today?  Here’s one more:  Of all the jobs I applied for when leaving &lt;br /&gt;Chicago&lt;br /&gt; in 1969, I wanted one much more than the rest but didn’t get it.  A few years ago, the company’s &lt;br /&gt;campus recruiter told me I had been chosen, but on the relevant morning the partner in charge came in &lt;br /&gt;hung over and failed to call me with the positive message he was supposed to deliver.  Just think: but &lt;br /&gt;for that bit of “bad luck” I could have spent the next 39 years at Lehman Brothers! &lt;br /&gt;I know how lucky I’ve been.  I find it incredibly uplifting and the source of great optimism regarding the &lt;br /&gt;future to know and appreciate my good fortune.  Rather than detract from my satisfaction over the success &lt;br /&gt;I’ve enjoyed – because of having to admit it wasn’t all my own doing –&lt;br /&gt; this realization makes me feel &lt;br /&gt;fortunate to have been born when and where I was and to have benefitted from the developments that &lt;br /&gt;came along.  I revel in my good luck. &lt;br /&gt;And what about the things I may have brought to my career: perhaps intelligence, insight and a talent for &lt;br /&gt;writing?  Isn’t having these things a form of luck?  Intelligent and innately talented people didn’t do &lt;br /&gt;any&lt;br /&gt;thing to earn their gifts.  No one can take credit for them as “something I did” or “something that was &lt;br /&gt;within my control.”  These things, too, are luck, and something for which we should give thanks rather &lt;br /&gt;than take credit. &lt;br /&gt;Luck in Investing &lt;br /&gt;Rather than “you make your own luck,” there’s an old saying that provides a better way to put it: “luck is &lt;br /&gt;what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”  If you prepare through study and practice, work hard &lt;br /&gt;and bring your talents to bear, you’ll be positioned to make the most out of opportunities that arise.  This &lt;br /&gt;way of looking at life is in line with my formulation regarding investment results: performance is what &lt;br /&gt;happens when events collide with an existing portfolio. &lt;br /&gt;We arrange our lives&lt;br /&gt; – or, in investing, our portfolios – in expectation of what we think will happen &lt;br /&gt;in the future.  In general, &lt;br /&gt;we get the desired results if future events conform to our hopes or &lt;br /&gt;expectations, and less-desired results if they don’t. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people – like those of us at Oaktree – who don’t consider themselves macro forecasters or &lt;br /&gt;market timers?  Even the most devoted value investor acts on the basis of expectations: that an asset &lt;br /&gt;selling at x will turn out to be worth 2x, and that one of these days everyone else will recognize its value &lt;br /&gt;and bid it up.  And the agnostic buy-and-hold equity investor operates under the assumption that the &lt;br /&gt;economy will expand, companie&lt;br /&gt;s will increase their profits, and stock prices will rise as a result.   &lt;br /&gt;Let’s say investors reach their conclusions about current intrinsic value or future earnings growth &lt;br /&gt;by applying skillful analysis to accurate data and reasonable assumptions.  Let’s grant, in short, &lt;br /&gt;that their conclusions are “right” in some abstract sense.  It still takes a great deal of luck for their &lt;br /&gt;version of future events to materialize.   &lt;br /&gt;Elroy Dimson of the London Business School is responsible for one of the most trenchant &lt;br /&gt;observations: “Risk means more things can happen than will happen.”  In other words, the future &lt;br /&gt;isn’t a predetermined scenario that’s sure to unfold, but rather a range of possibilities, any one of which &lt;br /&gt;may happen.  Investors formulate opinions as to which of them will happen.  Those opinions may be &lt;br /&gt;well-reasoned or dart throws.  But even the most rigorously derived view of the future is far from sure to &lt;br /&gt;be right.  Many other things may happen instead. &lt;br /&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s views, expressed in Fooled by Randomness, connect up with Dimson’s.  The &lt;br /&gt;world is an uncertain, even random, place.  What “should happen” might be totally clear, meaning we &lt;br /&gt;know what the future should hold.  But the things that should happen may not happen – and other things &lt;br /&gt;may happen instead – for any of a variety of reasons, many of them extraneous, unpredictable and even &lt;br /&gt;nonsensical.  Those things can be described as random: the result of luck, either good or bad. &lt;br /&gt;The point is that we assemble our portfolios, and future events determine whether our performance &lt;br /&gt;will be rewarded or punished.  People whose&lt;br /&gt; expectations are borne out generally make money, and &lt;br /&gt;those whose aren’t lose.  That process sounds very fact-based, meritocratic and luck-free, and thus &lt;br /&gt;dependable.  But that’s only the case on average and in the longest-term sense. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, even though an investor’s projections may be far too optimistic relative to what he&lt;br /&gt;should have expected – a.k.a. “wrong” – the investor is bailed out by unforeseeable positive&lt;br /&gt;developments, or even by non-fundamentally based price appreciation.  Either way, the stock&lt;br /&gt;rises and the investor is applauded.  I’d say he was “right fo&lt;br /&gt;r the wrong reason” (or “lucky”).&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, a prudent, skillful investor may formulate a reasonable view of the future, only to&lt;br /&gt;see the world go off the rails and his investments fail.  He might be described as “wrong for the&lt;br /&gt;wrong reason” (or “unlucky”).&lt;br /&gt;An inves&lt;br /&gt;tor may take an appropriately cautious stance – let’s say toward tech stocks in 1997 or&lt;br /&gt;residen&lt;br /&gt;tial mortgage backed securities in 2005 – only to see an irrationally overpriced market&lt;br /&gt;become more so, as prices soar for years.  He looks terrible, a victim of the old adage that “being&lt;br /&gt;too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.”&lt;br /&gt;Further, in a special case of being wrong as to timing although perhaps not fundamentals, an&lt;br /&gt;investor may take a concentrated position in a laughably underpriced stock, using a huge amount&lt;br /&gt;of borrowed money.  But before the expected appreciation can take place, a market crash brings&lt;br /&gt;on a margin call, and he’s wiped out.  As John Maynard Keynes said, “The market can remain&lt;br /&gt;irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”&lt;br /&gt;Last year marked the passing of Joe Granville, a technical analyst whose warning in 1976 was&lt;br /&gt;followed by a 26% two-year decline, winning him respect and fame.  But his next accurate call&lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t come for 24 years, when he told people to sell tech stocks in 2000.  Was it skill back in&lt;br /&gt;1976, or a lucky call that turned out right when events went his way?  Regardless, he became one&lt;br /&gt;of many in the investment business who get famous for having been “right once in a row.”&lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I remember learning at Wharton in 1963 was that the correctness of a decision can’t be &lt;br /&gt;judged from the outcome.  Because of the randomness at work in the world and the unpredictability of the &lt;br /&gt;future, lots of bad decisions lead to good results, and lots of good decisions end in failure. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, for an investor to both be right and make money:  &lt;br /&gt;his view of what will happen in the future – &lt;br /&gt;and what should be done about it – has to be&lt;br /&gt;analytically correct a priori,&lt;br /&gt;the things he thinks will happen have to actually happen, and&lt;br /&gt;those things have to happen on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;But in investing, it’s hard to know what will happen and impossible to know when it will happen.  Many &lt;br /&gt;things influence performance other than (a) investors’ hard work and skill and (b) the market’s &lt;br /&gt;dependable discounting of information about the future.  Luck – randomness, or the occurrence of things &lt;br /&gt;beyond our knowledge and control – plays a huge part in outcomes.   &lt;br /&gt;Investment success&lt;br /&gt; isn’t just a question of whether the investor put together the “right” portfolio, &lt;br /&gt;but also whet&lt;br /&gt;her it encountered a beneficial environment.  Thus being successful requires a &lt;br /&gt;significant degree of luck.  No one gets it right every time.  (That’s why&lt;br /&gt; even the best investors &lt;br /&gt;diversify, hedge and/or limit their use of leverage.)  But the skillful investor is right more often, over a &lt;br /&gt;long period of time, than an assumption of randomness would permit.  We say about such investors, “&lt;br /&gt;it &lt;br /&gt;can’t be luck.” &lt;br /&gt;*            *  * &lt;br /&gt;Where Is It Easiest to Get Lucky? &lt;br /&gt;The second inspiration for this memo came from a report entitled Alpha and the Paradox of Skill by &lt;br /&gt;Michael Mauboussin of Credit Suisse.  In it he talks about Jim Rutt, the CEO of Network Solutions.  As a &lt;br /&gt;young man, Rutt wanted to become a better poker player, and to that end he worked hard to learn the odds &lt;br /&gt;regarding each hand and how to detect “tells” in other players that give away their position. &lt;br /&gt;Here’s the part that attracted my attention: &lt;br /&gt;At that poin&lt;br /&gt;t, an uncle pulled him aside and doled out some advice.  “Jim, I wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;spend my time getting better,” he advised, “I’d spend my time finding weak games.” &lt;br /&gt;Success in investing has two aspects.  The first is skill, which requires you to be &lt;br /&gt;technically proficient.  Technical skills include the ability to find mispriced securities &lt;br /&gt;(based on capabilities in modeling, financial statement analysis, competitive strategy &lt;br /&gt;analysis, and valuation all while sidestepping behavioral biases) and a good framework &lt;br /&gt;for portfolio construction.  The second aspect is the game in which you choose to &lt;br /&gt;compete.  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;Mauboussin goes on to talk primarily about changes in the relative importance of luck and skill.  But for &lt;br /&gt;me, what his words keyed first and foremost were musings about market efficiency and inefficiency.  &lt;br /&gt;What they highlighted is that the easiest way to win at poker is by playing in easy games in which other &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;players make mistakes.  Likewise, the easiest way to win at investing is by sticking to inefficient &lt;br /&gt;markets. &lt;br /&gt;Luck and Efficiency &lt;br /&gt;Here’s my take on the efficient market hypothesis: Thousands of intelligent, computer-literate, objective, &lt;br /&gt;unemotional, highly motivated and hard-working investors spend a great deal of time searching for &lt;br /&gt;information about assets and analyzing what it means for their value.  For this reason, all available &lt;br /&gt;information is incorporated instantaneously in market prices.  This causes the market price of every asset &lt;br /&gt;to accurately reflect its intrinsic value, such that an investor in the asset will enjoy a risk-adjusted return &lt;br /&gt;that is fair relative to the return on all other assets: no more and no less.  Thus there are no &lt;br /&gt;“inefficiencies,&lt;br /&gt;” or instances where assets are priced incorrectly so as to provide an “excess return” or a &lt;br /&gt;“free lunch.”  For this reason, no individuals are able to demonstrate superior investment skill (“alpha”).  &lt;br /&gt;Even if some people were smart enough to take advantage of pricing errors, the market doesn’t present &lt;br /&gt;errors for them to take advantage of.  As a result, nobody can beat the market. &lt;br /&gt;I have one main disagreement with the theory as presented above.  Whereas the academics say in an &lt;br /&gt;efficient market the price of each asset accurately reflects its intrinsic value, I say the price set by the &lt;br /&gt;consensus does the best job of estimating the asset’s intrinsic value.  In other words, the academics say &lt;br /&gt;market prices are right, while I say they may be wrong but can’t consistently be improved upon (and the &lt;br /&gt;errors taken advantage of) by any individual.  A market may not be efficient in the sense that prices are &lt;br /&gt;“right,” but it can be efficient in that it swiftly incorporates new information.  The resulting prices may &lt;br /&gt;not be equal to the value, but they reflect everyone’s best collective thinking at a point in time.  The &lt;br /&gt;result is the same: no one can beat the market.   &lt;br /&gt;I think of the test for market efficiency as being twofold: if markets are efficient, (a) one market’s risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted return can’t be better or worse than any other market and (b) no investor in the market can &lt;br /&gt;outperform the rest in risk-adjusted terms.  In other words, there can’t &lt;br /&gt;be opportunities for &lt;br /&gt;outperformance . . . either through skill or luck.  In an efficient market –&lt;br /&gt; as with a Swiss watch (or, &lt;br /&gt;as Taleb would say, in dentistry) – luck plays no part. &lt;br /&gt;Are Markets Efficient?  Is the Hypothesis Relevant? &lt;br /&gt;Let me say up front that I have always considered the reasoning behind the efficient market &lt;br /&gt;hypothesis absolutely sound and compelling, and it has greatly influenced my thinking.   &lt;br /&gt;In well-followed markets, thousands of people are looking for superior investments and trying to avoid &lt;br /&gt;inferior ones.  If they find information indicating something’s a bargain, they buy it, driving up the price &lt;br /&gt;and eliminating the potential for an excess return.  Likewise, if they find an overpriced asset, they sell it &lt;br /&gt;or short it, driving down the price and lifting its prospective return.  I think it makes perfect sense to &lt;br /&gt;expect intelligent market participants to drive out mispricings.  &lt;br /&gt;The efficien&lt;br /&gt;t market hypothesis is compelling . . . as a hypothesis.  But is it relevant in the real &lt;br /&gt;world?  (As Yogi Berra said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in &lt;br /&gt;practice there is.”)  The answer lies in the fact that no hypothesis is any better than the assumptions on &lt;br /&gt;which it’s premised.   &lt;br /&gt;I believe many markets are quite efficient.  Everyone is aware of them, basically understands them, and &lt;br /&gt;is willing to invest in them.  And in general everyone gets the same information at the same time (in fact, &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s one of the SEC’s missions to make sure that’s the case).  I had markets like that in mind in 1978 &lt;br /&gt;when, on going into portfolio management, my rule was, “I’ll do anything but spend the rest of my life &lt;br /&gt;choosing between Merck and Lilly.” &lt;br /&gt;But I also believe some markets are less efficient than others.  Not everyone knows about them or &lt;br /&gt;understands them. They may be controversial, making people hesitant to invest.  They may appear too &lt;br /&gt;risky for some.  They may be hard to invest in, illiquid, or accessible only through locked-up vehicles in &lt;br /&gt;which some people can’t or don’t want to participate.  Some market participants may have better &lt;br /&gt;information than others . . . legally.  Thus, in an inefficient market there can be mastery and/or luck, &lt;br /&gt;since market prices are often wrong, enabling some investors to do better than others.   &lt;br /&gt;(Time for an asi&lt;br /&gt;de: the fact that a market is inefficient doesn’t mean everyone in it gets rich.  It simply &lt;br /&gt;means there are overpricings and underpricings, to profit from or fall victim to.  Thus there can be &lt;br /&gt;winners and losers.  Even in an inefficient market, not everyone can be above average.) &lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, there’s one reason why I think no markets are perfectly efficient.  Remember the &lt;br /&gt;assumptions underlying market efficiency: the participants have to be objective and unemotional.  &lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the market, few investors pass that test.  How many are unemotional enough to resist &lt;br /&gt;buying into a fast-rising bubble, or selling in a crash when the price of an asset appears to be on the way &lt;br /&gt;to zero? &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that (a) you mustn’t ignore the concept of efficiency, and at the same time, (b) &lt;br /&gt;you mustn’t accept it as universally true.  As I wrote in What’s It All About, Alpha (July 2001): &lt;br /&gt;If we entirely ignore theory, we can make big mistakes.  We can fool ourselves into &lt;br /&gt;thinking it’s possible to know more than everyone else and regularly beat heavily &lt;br /&gt;populated markets. . . .  But swallowing theory whole can make us turn the process over &lt;br /&gt;to a computer and miss out on the contribution skillful individuals can make. &lt;br /&gt;Rather than expect markets to routinely provide a free lunch, I think there should be a &lt;br /&gt;presumption that they’re efficient.  The burden of proof should be on anyone who thinks a market &lt;br /&gt;provides underpriced investments that no one else is smart enough to detect and pursue.  It’s safer to be &lt;br /&gt;skeptical of the exis&lt;br /&gt;tence of freebies than to assume unappreciated bargains are rife for the taking.   &lt;br /&gt;It’s important to note, however, that market efficiency shouldn’t be considered something that’s &lt;br /&gt;universally applicable, but rather what Bruce Karsh has taught me to call a “rebuttable presumption.”  &lt;br /&gt;You should start out thinking it’s the general rule, but its applicability can be disproved in individual &lt;br /&gt;situations.  The possibility of inefficiency shouldn’t be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;In the old story on this subject, the professor of finance theory is taking a walk across the campus with &lt;br /&gt;one of his students.  The student says, “Look professor: isn’t that a $10 bill on the ground?”  The &lt;br /&gt;professor answers, “It can’t be a $10 bill.  If it were, someone would have picked it up by now.”  The &lt;br /&gt;professor turns and walks away, and the student picks it up and has a beer.  &lt;br /&gt;My History with Inefficiency &lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above, I was lucky in 1978 when Citibank asked me to manage a portfolio for the &lt;br /&gt;brokerage house Bache, which wanted to offer a high yield bond mutual fund.  This was the first of many &lt;br /&gt;opportunities I’ve enjoyed for free lunches. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five years ago, the high yield bond market was a classic example of market inefficiency.  &lt;br /&gt;It was little known and little researched.&lt;br /&gt;There was little reported performance history.&lt;br /&gt;There was no centralized trading and no reported data on prices.&lt;br /&gt;Few professionals invested in them.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, high yield bonds were viewed as unseemly and investing in them was&lt;br /&gt;considered improper.  I’ll never forget Moody’s definition of a B-rated bond: “fails to possess the&lt;br /&gt;characteristics of a desirable investment.”&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, they were banned under most institutions’ policies, which limited investment to&lt;br /&gt;bonds rated “A or better” or “investment grade (triple-B or better).”&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, they were known by the derogatory term “junk bonds.” &lt;br /&gt; Like the finance&lt;br /&gt;professor in the story, most investors turned up their noses and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;The elements li&lt;br /&gt;sted above caused high yield bonds to be disrespected and shunned, and thus to be &lt;br /&gt;underpriced and of&lt;br /&gt;fer yields that were too high for the risk involved.  How do I know?  Because (a) &lt;br /&gt;the yield spread offered as compensation for bearing risk has proved to be excessive, (b) the bonds have &lt;br /&gt;outperformed other forms of fixed income investing over the long term, and (c) Sheldon Stone has been &lt;br /&gt;able to compile a risk-adjusted net return above his benchmarks for the 28 years over which he’s managed &lt;br /&gt;our portfolios.  High yield bonds have provided the foundation for much of Oaktree’s success and many &lt;br /&gt;of its subsequent initiatives. &lt;br /&gt;Ten years la&lt;br /&gt;ter, in 1988, Sheldon and I agreed with Bruce Karsh that we should organize our first &lt;br /&gt;distressed debt fund, and Bruce hired Richard Masson to join him in the task.  While the prominence of &lt;br /&gt;Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken had attracted attention to high yield bonds by that time, distressed &lt;br /&gt;debt was still little known and poorly understood.  What could be more unseemly and frightening than the &lt;br /&gt;debt of companies that were bankrupt or that appeared overwhelmingly likely to become so?  No &lt;br /&gt;mainstream financial institutions invested in distressed debt or offered distressed debt funds, leaving an &lt;br /&gt;open playing field for us.  Bruce’s aggregate since-inception return of 23% per year before fees (17½% &lt;br /&gt;after) – without the benefit of leverage – certainly suggests that inefficiencies have been present.  And the &lt;br /&gt;fact that he ha&lt;br /&gt;s earned that return over 25 years while investing $35 billion says it wasn’t luck. &lt;br /&gt;My point here is t&lt;br /&gt;hat these markets – and others that Oaktree entered over the years – have been &lt;br /&gt;ineffici&lt;br /&gt;ent markets.  The lack of information, infrastructure, understanding and competition &lt;br /&gt;created many opportunities for us to find bargains, and for our clients in those markets to enjoy &lt;br /&gt;favorable returns with less-than-commensurate risk. &lt;br /&gt;The Durability of Inefficiency &lt;br /&gt;If efficiency should be the going-in presumption, so should “efficientization.”  That’s my term for the &lt;br /&gt;process through which a market becomes more efficient.  In short, over time the actions of diligent &lt;br /&gt;investors should have the effect of driving out bargains.  If at first bargains exist, their holders will enjoy &lt;br /&gt;superior risk-adjusted returns, other investors will take note, and they’ll study them and bid them up &lt;br /&gt;enough to eliminate the bargain element and thus the potential for further excess returns.  If the &lt;br /&gt;inefficiency is caused by underdeveloped market infrastructure, you can expect centralized trading, price &lt;br /&gt;reporting, performance data and consultant focus to develop. &lt;br /&gt;It requires a certain degree of malfunction for the market to allow an investor to find a bargain, &lt;br /&gt;buy it on the cheap and enjoy an excess return.  But it takes a much greater degree of malfunction &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for everyone else to fail to notice that investor’s success, fail to emulate his methods, and thus allow &lt;br /&gt;the bargain to persist.  Usually a free-lunch counter should be expected to be picked clean. &lt;br /&gt;The Current State of Market Efficiency &lt;br /&gt;Let’s compare the current environment for efficiency with that of the past.  &lt;br /&gt;Data on all forms of investing is freely available in vast quantities.&lt;br /&gt;Every investor has extensive computing power.  In contrast, there were essentially no PCs or even&lt;br /&gt;four-function calculators before 1970, and no laptops before 1980.&lt;br /&gt;“Hedge fund,” &lt;br /&gt;“alternative investing,” “distressed debt,” “high yield bond,” “private equity,”&lt;br /&gt;“mortgage backed security” and “emerging market” are all household words today.  Thirty years&lt;br /&gt;ago they &lt;br /&gt;were non-existent, little known or poorly understood.  Today, as I say about the impact&lt;br /&gt;of the browsers on our mobile phones, “everyone knows everything.”&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays few people make moral judgments about investments.  There aren’t many instances of&lt;br /&gt;investors turning down an investment just because it’s controversial or unseemly.  In contrast,&lt;br /&gt;most will do anything to make a buck.&lt;br /&gt;There are about 8,000 hedge funds in the world, many of which have wide-open charters and&lt;br /&gt;pride themselves on being infinitely flexible.&lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to prove efficiency or inefficiency.  Among other reasons, the academics say it takes many &lt;br /&gt;decades of data to reach a conclusion with “statistical significance,” but by the time the requisite number &lt;br /&gt;of yea&lt;br /&gt;rs have passed, the environment is likely to have been altered.  Regardless, I think we must look at &lt;br /&gt;the changes listed above and accept that the conditions of today are less propitious for inefficiency than &lt;br /&gt;those of the past.  In short, it makes sense to accept that most games are no longer as easy as they &lt;br /&gt;used to be, and that as a result free lunches are scarcer.  Thus, in general, I think it will be harder &lt;br /&gt;to earn superior risk-adjusted returns in the future, and the margin of superiority will be smaller. &lt;br /&gt;People often ask me about the inefficient markets of tomorrow.  Think about it: that’s an oxymoron.  It’s &lt;br /&gt;like asking, “What is there that hasn’t been discovered yet?”  &lt;br /&gt;The markets are greatly changed from &lt;br /&gt;25, 35 or 45 years ago.  The bottom line today is that there’s little that people don’t know about, &lt;br /&gt;understand and embrace.   &lt;br /&gt;How, then, do I expect &lt;br /&gt;to find inefficiency?  My answer is that while few markets demonstrate great &lt;br /&gt;structural inefficiency today, many exhibit a great deal of cyclical inefficiency from time to time.  Just &lt;br /&gt;five years ago, there were lots of things people wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole, and as a result they &lt;br /&gt;offered absurdly high returns.  Most of those opportunities are gone today, but I’m sure they’ll be back &lt;br /&gt;the next time investors turn tail and run. &lt;br /&gt;Markets will be permanently efficient when investors are permanently objective and unemotional.  In &lt;br /&gt;other words, never.  Unless that unlikely day comes, skill and luck will both continue to play very &lt;br /&gt;important roles. &lt;br /&gt;January 16, 2014 &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Dare to Be Great II &lt;br /&gt;In September 2006, I wrote a memo entitled Dare to Be Great, with suggestions on how &lt;br /&gt;institutional investors might approach the goal of achieving superior investment results.  I’ve had &lt;br /&gt;some additional thoughts on the matter since then, meaning it’s time to return to it.  Since fewer &lt;br /&gt;people were reading my memos in those days, I’m going to start off repeating &lt;br /&gt;a bit of its content &lt;br /&gt;and go on from there. &lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, a sovereign wealth fund that’s an Oaktree client asked me to speak to their &lt;br /&gt;leadership group on the subject of what makes for a superior investing organization.  I welcomed &lt;br /&gt;the opportunity.  The first thing you have to do, I told them, is &lt;br /&gt;formulate an explicit investing &lt;br /&gt;creed.  What do you believe in?  What principles will underpin your process?  The investing &lt;br /&gt;team and the people who review their performance have to be in agreement on questions like &lt;br /&gt;these: &lt;br /&gt;Is the efficient market hypothesis relevant?  Do efficient markets exist?  Is it possible to&lt;br /&gt;“beat the market”?  Which markets?  To what extent?&lt;br /&gt;Will you emphasize risk control or return maximization as the primary route to success&lt;br /&gt;(or do you think it’s possible to achieve &lt;br /&gt;both simultaneously)?&lt;br /&gt;Will you put your faith in macro forecasts and adjust your portfolio based on what they&lt;br /&gt;say?&lt;br /&gt;How do you think about risk?  Is it volatility or the probability of permanent loss?  Can it&lt;br /&gt;be predicted and quantified a priori?  What’s the best way to manage it?&lt;br /&gt;How reliably do you believe a disciplined process will produce the desired results?  That&lt;br /&gt;is, how do you view the question of determinism versus randomness?&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly for the purposes of this memo, how will you define success, and&lt;br /&gt;what risks will you take to achieve it?  In short, in trying to be right, are you willing&lt;br /&gt;to bear the inescapable risk of being wrong?&lt;br /&gt;Passive investors, benchmark huggers and &lt;br /&gt;herd followers have a high probability of achieving &lt;br /&gt;average performance and little risk of fal&lt;br /&gt;ling far short.  But in exchange for safety from being &lt;br /&gt;much below average, they surrender their chance of being much above average. All investors &lt;br /&gt;have to decide whether that’s okay.  And,&lt;br /&gt; if not, what they’ll do about it. &lt;br /&gt;The more I think about it, the more angles I see in the title Dare to Be Great.  Who wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;dare to be great?  No one.  Everyone would love to have outstanding performance.  The real &lt;br /&gt;question is whether you dare to do the things that are necessary in order to be great.  Are &lt;br /&gt;you willing to be different, and are you willing to be wrong?  In order to have a chance at &lt;br /&gt;great &lt;br /&gt;results, you have to be open to being both. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare to Be Different &lt;br /&gt;Here’s a line from Dare to Be Great:  “This just in: you can’t take the same actions as &lt;br /&gt;everyone else and expect to outperform.”  &lt;br /&gt;Simple, but still appropriate.   &lt;br /&gt;For years I’ve posed the following riddle: Suppose I hire you as a portfolio manager and we &lt;br /&gt;agree you will get no compensation next year if your return is in the bottom nine deciles of the &lt;br /&gt;investor universe but $10 million if you’re in the top decile.  What’s the first thing you have to &lt;br /&gt;do –&lt;br /&gt; the absolute prerequisite – in order to have a chance at the big money?  No one has &lt;br /&gt;ever answered it right. &lt;br /&gt;The answer may not be obvious, but it’s imperative: you have to assemble a portfolio that’s &lt;br /&gt;different from those held by most other investors.  If your portfolio looks like everyone else’s, &lt;br /&gt;you&lt;br /&gt; may do well, or you may do poorly, but you can’t do different.  And being different is &lt;br /&gt;absolutely essential if you want a chance at being superior.  In order to get into the top of the &lt;br /&gt;performance distribution, you have to escape from the crowd.  There are many ways to try.  They &lt;br /&gt;include being active in unusual market niches; buying things others haven’t found, don’t like or &lt;br /&gt;consider too risky to touch; avoiding market darlings that the crowd thinks can’t lose; engaging &lt;br /&gt;in contrarian cycle timing; and concentrating heavily in a small number of things you think will &lt;br /&gt;deliver exceptional performance. &lt;br /&gt;Dare to Be Great included the two-by-two matrix and paragraph below.  Several people told me &lt;br /&gt;the matrix was helpful.   &lt;br /&gt;Of course it’s not that easy and clear-cut, but I think that’s the general situation.  &lt;br /&gt;If your behavior and that of your managers is conventional, you’re likely to get &lt;br /&gt;conventional results – either good or bad.  Only if your behavior is &lt;br /&gt;unconventional is your performance likely to be unconventional . . . and only &lt;br /&gt;if your judgments are superior is your performance likely to be above &lt;br /&gt;average. &lt;br /&gt;For those who define investment success as being “average or better,” three of the four cells of &lt;br /&gt;the matrix represent satisfactory outcomes.  But if you define success strictly as being superior, &lt;br /&gt;only one of the four will do, and it require&lt;br /&gt;s unconventional behavior.  More from the 2006 &lt;br /&gt;memo: &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line on striving for superior performance has a lot to do with daring to &lt;br /&gt;be great.  Especially in terms of asset allocation, “can’t lose” usually goes &lt;br /&gt;hand-in-hand with “can’t win.”  &lt;br /&gt;One of the investor’s or the committee’s first &lt;br /&gt;and most fundamental decisions has to be on the question of how far out the &lt;br /&gt;Conventional &lt;br /&gt;Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Unconventional &lt;br /&gt;Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Favorable &lt;br /&gt;Outcomes &lt;br /&gt;Average good results Above-average results &lt;br /&gt;Unfavorable &lt;br /&gt;Outcomes &lt;br /&gt;Average bad results Below-average results &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;portfolio will venture.  How much emphasis should be put on diversifying, &lt;br /&gt;avoiding risk and ensuring against below-pack performance, and how much &lt;br /&gt;on sacrificing these things in the hope of doing better? &lt;br /&gt;In the memo I mentioned my favorite fortune cookie: “the cautious seldom err or write great &lt;br /&gt;poetry.”  &lt;br /&gt;Like the title Dare to Be Great, I find the fortune cookie thought-provoking.  It can be &lt;br /&gt;taken as urging caution, since it &lt;br /&gt;reduces the likelihood of error.  Or it can be taken as saying you &lt;br /&gt;should avoid caution, since it can keep you from doing great things.  Or both.  No right or wrong &lt;br /&gt;answer, but a choice . . . and hopefully a conscious one. &lt;br /&gt;It Isn’t Easy Being Different &lt;br /&gt;In the 2006 memo, I borrowed two quotes from Pioneering Portfolio Management by David &lt;br /&gt;Swensen of Yale.  They’re my absolute favorites on the subject of institutional behavior.  Here’s &lt;br /&gt;the first: &lt;br /&gt;Establishing and maintaini&lt;br /&gt;ng an unconventional investment profile requires &lt;br /&gt;acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which frequently appear &lt;br /&gt;downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom. &lt;br /&gt;“Uncomfortably idiosyncratic” is a terrific phrase.  There’s a great deal of wisdom in those two &lt;br /&gt;words.  What’s idiosyncratic is rarely comfortable . . . and in order for something to be &lt;br /&gt;comfortable, it usually has to be conventional.  The road to above average performance runs &lt;br /&gt;through unconventional, uncomfort&lt;br /&gt;able investing.  Here’s how I put it in 2006: &lt;br /&gt;Non-consensus ideas have to be lonely.  By definition, non-consensus ideas that &lt;br /&gt;are popular, widely held or intuitively obvious are an oxymoron.  Thus such &lt;br /&gt;ideas are uncomfortable; non-conformists don’t enjoy the warmth that comes with &lt;br /&gt;being at the center of the herd.  Further, unconventional ideas often appear &lt;br /&gt;imprudent.  The popular definition of “prudent” – &lt;br /&gt;especially in the investment &lt;br /&gt;world – is often twisted into “what everyone does.”   &lt;br /&gt;Most great investments begin in discomfort.  The things most people feel good about – &lt;br /&gt;investments where the underlying premise is widely accepted, the recent performance has been &lt;br /&gt;positive and the outlook is rosy – are unlikely to be available at bargain prices.  Rather, bargains &lt;br /&gt;are usually found among things that are controversial, that people are pessimistic about, and that &lt;br /&gt;have been performing badly of late.     &lt;br /&gt;But it isn’t easy to do things that entail discomfort.  It’s no coincidence that distressed debt has &lt;br /&gt;been the source of many successful investments for Oaktree; there’s no such thing as a distressed &lt;br /&gt;company that everyone reveres.  In 1988, when Bruce Karsh and I organized our first fund to &lt;br /&gt;invest in the debt of companies seemingly at death’s door&lt;br /&gt;, the very idea made it hard to raise &lt;br /&gt;money, and investing required conviction – on the clients’ part and our  own – that our analysis &lt;br /&gt;and approach would mitigate the risk.  The same discomfort, however, is what caused distressed &lt;br /&gt;debt to be priced cheaper than it should have been, and thus the returns to be consistently high. &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare to Be Wrong &lt;br /&gt;“You have to give yourself a chance to fail.”  That’s what Kenny “The Jet” Smith said on TV &lt;br /&gt;the other night during the NCAA college basketball tournament, talking about a star player who &lt;br /&gt;started out cold and as a result attempted &lt;br /&gt;too few shots in a game his team lost.  It’s a great way &lt;br /&gt;to make the point.  Failure isn’t anyone’s goal, of course, but rather an inescapable potential &lt;br /&gt;consequence of trying to do really well.   &lt;br /&gt;Any attempt to compile superior investment results has to entail acceptance of the possibility of &lt;br /&gt;being wrong.  The matrix on page two shows that since conventional behavior is sure to produce &lt;br /&gt;average performance, people who want to be above average can’t expect to get there &lt;br /&gt;by engaging &lt;br /&gt;in conventional behavior.  Their behavior has to be different.  And in the course of trying to be &lt;br /&gt;different and better, they have to bear the risk of being different and worse.  That truth is &lt;br /&gt;simply unarguable.  There is no way to strive for the former that doesn’t require bearing the risk &lt;br /&gt;of the latter. &lt;br /&gt;The truth is, almost everything abou&lt;br /&gt;t superior investing is a two-edged sword: &lt;br /&gt;If you invest, you will lose money if the market declines.&lt;br /&gt;If you don’t invest, you will miss out on gains if the market rises.&lt;br /&gt;Market timing will add value if it can be done right.&lt;br /&gt;Buy-and-hold will produce better results if timing can’t be done right.&lt;br /&gt;Aggressiveness will help when the market rises but hurt when it falls.&lt;br /&gt;Defensiveness will help when the market falls but hurt when it rises.&lt;br /&gt;If you concentrate your portfolio, your mistakes will kill you.&lt;br /&gt;If you diversify, the payoff from your successes will be diminished.&lt;br /&gt;If you employ leverage, your successes will be magnified.&lt;br /&gt;If you employ leverage, your mistakes will be magnified.&lt;br /&gt;Each of these pairings indicates symmetry.  None of the tactics listed will add value if it’s right &lt;br /&gt;but not subtract if it’s wrong.  Thus none of these tactics, in and of itself, can hold the secret to &lt;br /&gt;dependably above average investment performance. &lt;br /&gt;There’s only one thing in the investment world &lt;br /&gt;that isn’t two-edged, and that’s “alpha”: superior &lt;br /&gt;insight or skill.  Skill can help in both up markets and down markets.  And by making it more &lt;br /&gt;likely that your decisions are right, superior skill can increase the expected benefit from &lt;br /&gt;concentration and leverage.  But that kind of superior skill by definition is rare and elusive. &lt;br /&gt;The goal in investing is asymmetry: t&lt;br /&gt;o expose yourself to return in a way that doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;expose you commensurately to ris&lt;br /&gt;k, and to participate in gains when the market rises to a &lt;br /&gt;greater extent than you participate in losses when it falls.  But that doesn’t mean the &lt;br /&gt;avoidance of all losses is a reasonable objective.  Take another look at the goal of asymmetry set &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;out above: it talks about achieving a preponderance of gain over loss, not avoiding all &lt;br /&gt;chance of loss.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To succeed at any activity involving the pursuit of gain, w&lt;br /&gt;e have to be able to withstand the &lt;br /&gt;possibility of loss.  A goal of avoiding all losses can render success unachievable almost as &lt;br /&gt;readily as can the occurrence of too many losses.  Here are three examples of “loss prevention &lt;br /&gt;strategies” that can lead to failure: &lt;br /&gt;I play tennis.  But if when I start a match I promise myself that I won’t commit a single&lt;br /&gt;double fault, I’ll never be able to put enough “mustard” on my second serve to keep it&lt;br /&gt;from being easy for my opponent to put away.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, coming out ahead at poker requires that I win a lot on my winning hands and&lt;br /&gt;lose less on my losers.  But insisting that I’ll never play anything but “the nuts” – the&lt;br /&gt;hand that can’t possibly be beat &lt;br /&gt;– will keep me from playing lots of hands that have a&lt;br /&gt;good chance to win but aren’t sure things.&lt;br /&gt;For a real-life example, Oaktree has always emphasized default avoidance as the route to&lt;br /&gt;outperformance in high yield bonds. Thus our default rate has consistently averaged just&lt;br /&gt;1/3 of the universe default rate, and our risk-adjusted return has beaten the indices. But if&lt;br /&gt;we had insisted on –&lt;br /&gt; and designed compensation to demand – zero defaults, I’m sure we&lt;br /&gt;would have been too risk averse and our performance wouldn’t have been as good.  As&lt;br /&gt;my partner Sheldon Stone puts it, “If you don’t have any defaults, you’re taking too little&lt;br /&gt;risk.”&lt;br /&gt;When I first went to work at&lt;br /&gt; Citibank in 1968, they had a slogan that “scared money never &lt;br /&gt;wins.”  It’s important to play judiciously, to have more successes than failures, and to make &lt;br /&gt;more on your successes than you lose on your failures.  But it’s crippling to have to avoid &lt;br /&gt;all failures, and insisting on doing so can’t be a winning strategy.  It may guarantee you &lt;br /&gt;against losses, but it’s likely to guarantee you against gains as well.  Here’s some helpful &lt;br /&gt;wisdom on the subject from Wayne Gretzky, considered by many to be the greatest hockey &lt;br /&gt;player who ever lived: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” &lt;br /&gt;There is no formulaic approach&lt;br /&gt; to investing that can be depended on to produce superior risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted returns.  There can’t b&lt;br /&gt;e.  In a relatively fair or “efficient” market – and the concerted &lt;br /&gt;efforts of investors to find underpriced assets tend to make most markets quite fair –&lt;br /&gt; asymmetry &lt;br /&gt;is reduced, and a formula that everyone can access can’t possibly work. &lt;br /&gt;As John Kenneth Galbraith said, “There is nothing reliable to be learned about making &lt;br /&gt;money.  If there were, study would be intense and everyone with a positive IQ would be rich.”  If &lt;br /&gt;merely applying a formula that’s available to everyone could be counted on to provide easy &lt;br /&gt;profits, where would those profits com&lt;br /&gt;e from?  Who would be the losers in those transactions?  &lt;br /&gt;Why wouldn’t those people study and apply the formula also? &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as Charlie Munger told me, “It’s not supposed to be easy.  Anyone who finds it easy is &lt;br /&gt;stupid.”  In other words, anyone who thinks it can be easy to succeed at investing is being &lt;br /&gt;simplistic and superficial, and ignoring investing’s &lt;br /&gt;complex and competitive nature. &lt;br /&gt;Why should superior profits be available to the novice, the untutored or the lazy?  Why should &lt;br /&gt;people be able to make above average returns without hard work and above average skill, and &lt;br /&gt;without knowing something most others don’t know?  And yet many individuals invest based on &lt;br /&gt;the belief that they &lt;br /&gt;can.  (If they didn’t believe that, wouldn’t they index or, at a minimum, turn &lt;br /&gt;over the task to others?)   &lt;br /&gt;No, the solution can’t lie in rigid tactics, publicly available formulas or loss-eliminating rules . . . &lt;br /&gt;or &lt;br /&gt;in complete risk avoidance.  Superior investment results can only stem from a better-than-&lt;br /&gt;average ability to figure out when risk-taking will lead to gain and when it will end in loss.  &lt;br /&gt;There is no alternative. &lt;br /&gt;Dare to Look Wrong &lt;br /&gt;This is really the bottom-line: not whether you dare to be different or to be wrong, but &lt;br /&gt;whether you dare to look&lt;br /&gt; wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Most people understand and accept that in their effort to make correct investment decisions, they &lt;br /&gt;have to accept the risk of making mistakes.  Few people expect to find a lot of sure things or &lt;br /&gt;achieve a perfect batting average. &lt;br /&gt;While they accept the intellectual proposition that attempting to be a superior investor has to &lt;br /&gt;entail the ri&lt;br /&gt;sk of loss, many institutional investors –&lt;br /&gt; and especially those operating in a political &lt;br /&gt;or public arena – can find it unacceptable to look significantly wrong.  Compensation cuts and &lt;br /&gt;even job loss can befall the institutional employee who’s associated with too many mistakes.   &lt;br /&gt;As Pensions &amp; Investments said on March 17 regarding a big West Coast bond manager &lt;br /&gt;currently in the news, whom I’ll leave nameless:  &lt;br /&gt;. . . asset owners are concerned that doing business with the firm could bring &lt;br /&gt;unwanted attention, possibly creating headline risk and/or job risk for them. . . . &lt;br /&gt;One [executive] at a large public pension fund said his fund recently allocated &lt;br /&gt;$100 million for emerging markets, its first allocation to the firm.  He said he &lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t do that today, given the current situation, because it could lead to &lt;br /&gt;second-guessing by his board and the local press.   &lt;br /&gt;“If it doesn’t work out, it looks like you don’t know what you are doing,” he said. &lt;br /&gt;As an aside, let me say I find it perfectly logical that people should feel this way.  Most “agents” &lt;br /&gt;–those who invest the money of others – will benefit little from bold decisions that work but will&lt;br /&gt;suffer greatly from bold decisions that fail.  The possibility of receiving an “attaboy” for a few&lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;winners can’t balance out the risk of being fired after a string of losers.  Only someone who’s &lt;br /&gt;irrational would conclude that the incentives favor boldness under these circumstances.  &lt;br /&gt;Similarly, members of a non-profit organization’s investment committee can reasonably &lt;br /&gt;conclude that bearing the risk of embarrassment in front of their peers that accompanies bold but &lt;br /&gt;unsuccessful decisions is unwarranted given their volunteer positions. &lt;br /&gt;I’m convinced that for many institutional investment organizations the operative rule –&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;intentional or unconscious – is this: “We would never buy so much of something that if it &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t work, we’ll look bad.”  For many agents and their organizations, the realities of life &lt;br /&gt;mandate such a rule.  But people who follow this rule must understand that by definition it &lt;br /&gt;will keep them from buying enough of something that works for it to&lt;br /&gt; make much of a &lt;br /&gt;difference for the better. &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;br /&gt;1936, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote in The General Theory of Employment, &lt;br /&gt;Interest and Money, “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is bette  r &lt;br /&gt;for reputation to fail &lt;br /&gt;conventionally than to succeed unconventionally” [italics added].  For people who measur&lt;br /&gt;e &lt;br /&gt;success in terms of dollars and cents, risk taking can pay off when gains on winners are netted &lt;br /&gt;out against losses on losers.  But if reputation or job retention is what counts, losers may be &lt;br /&gt;all that matter, since winners may be incapable of outweighing them.  In that case, success &lt;br /&gt;may hinge entirely on the avoidance of unconventional behavior that’s unsuccessful.   &lt;br /&gt;Often the best way to choose between alternative courses of action is by figuring out which has &lt;br /&gt;the highest “expected value”: the total value arrived at by multiplying each possible outcome by &lt;br /&gt;its probability of occurring and summing the results.  As I learned from my first textbook at &lt;br /&gt;Wharton fifty years ago (Decisions Under Uncertainty by C. Jackson Grayson, Jr.), if one act has &lt;br /&gt;a higher expected value than another and “. . . if the decision maker is willing to regard the &lt;br /&gt;consequences of each act-event in purely monetary terms, then this would be the logical act to &lt;br /&gt;choose.  Keeping in mind, however, that only one event and &lt;br /&gt;its consequence will occur (not the &lt;br /&gt;weighted average consequence),” agents may not be able to choose on the basis of expected &lt;br /&gt;value or the weighted average of all possible consequences.  If a given action has potential bad &lt;br /&gt;consequences that are absolutely unacceptable, the expected value of all of its consequences &lt;br /&gt;– both good and bad – can be irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;Given the typical agent’s asymmetrical payoff table, the rule for institutional investors &lt;br /&gt;underlined above is far from nonsensical.  But if it is adopted, this should be done with &lt;br /&gt;awareness of the likely result: over-diversification.  This goes all the way back to the &lt;br /&gt;beginning of this memo, and each organization’s need t&lt;br /&gt;o establish its creed.  In this case, the &lt;br /&gt;following questions must be answered:   &lt;br /&gt;In trying to achieve superior investment results, to what extent will we concentrate on&lt;br /&gt;investments, strategies and managers we think are outstanding?  Will we do this despite&lt;br /&gt;the potential of our deci&lt;br /&gt;sions to be wrong and bring embarrassment?&lt;br /&gt;Or will fear of error, embarrassment, criticism and unpleasant headlines make us&lt;br /&gt;diversify highly, emulate the benchmark portfolio and trade boldness for safety?  Will we&lt;br /&gt;opt for low-cost, low-aspiration passive strategies?&lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the presentation described at the beginning of this memo, I pointed out to the &lt;br /&gt;sovereign wealth fund’s managers that they had allocated close to a billion dollars to Oaktree’s &lt;br /&gt;management over the preceding 15 years.  Although that sounds like a lot of money, it actually &lt;br /&gt;amounts to only a few tenths of a percent of wha&lt;br /&gt;t the world guesses their assets to be.  And given &lt;br /&gt;our funds’ cycle of investing and divesting, that means they didn’t have even a few tenths of a &lt;br /&gt;percent of their capital with us at any one time.  Thus, despite our good performance, I think it’s &lt;br /&gt;safe to say Oaktree couldn’t have had a meaningful impact on the fund’s overall results.  &lt;br /&gt;Certainly one would associate this behavior with an extreme lack of risk tolerance and a high &lt;br /&gt;aversion to headline risk.  &lt;br /&gt;I urged them to consider whether this reflects their real preference. &lt;br /&gt;Lou Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals was one of baseball’s best base stealers between 1966 and &lt;br /&gt;1974.  He’s the source of a great quote: “Show me a guy who’s afraid to look bad, and I’ll &lt;br /&gt;show you a guy you can beat every time.”  &lt;br /&gt;What he meant (with apologies to readers who &lt;br /&gt;don’t understand baseball) is that in order to prevent a great runner from stealing a base, a pitcher &lt;br /&gt;may have to throw over to the bag ten times in a row to hold him close, rather than pitch to the &lt;br /&gt;batter.  But after a few such throws, a pitcher can look like a scaredy-cat and be booed.  Pitchers &lt;br /&gt;who were afraid of those things were easy pickings for Lou Brock.  Fear of looking bad ensured &lt;br /&gt;their failure. &lt;br /&gt;Looking Right Can Be Harder Than Being Right &lt;br /&gt;Fear of looking bad can be particularly debilitating to an investor, client or manager.  This is &lt;br /&gt;because of how hard it is to consistently make correct investment decisions.  Some of this comes &lt;br /&gt;from my last memo, on the role of luck. &lt;br /&gt;First, it’s hard to consistently make decisions that correctly factor in all of the relevant&lt;br /&gt;facts and considerations (i.e., it’s hard to be right).&lt;br /&gt;Second, it’s far from certain that even “right” decisions will be successful, since every&lt;br /&gt;decision requires assumptions about what the future will look like, and even reasonable&lt;br /&gt;assumptions can be thwarted by the world’s randomness.  Thus many correct decisions&lt;br /&gt;will result in failure (i.e., it’s hard to look&lt;br /&gt; right).&lt;br /&gt;Third, even well-founded decisions that eventually turn out to be right are unlikely to do&lt;br /&gt;so promptly.  This is because not only are future events uncertain, their timing is&lt;br /&gt;particularly variable (i.e., it’s impossible to look right on time).&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to one of my three favorite adages: “Being too far ahead of your time is &lt;br /&gt;indistinguishable from being wrong.”&lt;br /&gt;  The fact that something’s cheap doesn’t mean it’s going &lt;br /&gt;to appreciate tomorrow; it can languish in the bargain basement.  And the fact that something’s &lt;br /&gt;overpriced certainly doesn’t mean it’ll fall right away; bull markets can go on for years.  As Lord &lt;br /&gt;Keynes observed, “the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” &lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Greenspan warned of “irrational exuberance” in December 1996, but the stock market &lt;br /&gt;continued upward for more than three years.  A brilliant manager I know who turned bearish &lt;br /&gt;around the same time had to wai&lt;br /&gt;t until 2000 to be proved correct . . . during which time his &lt;br /&gt;investors withdrew much of their capital.  He wasn’t &lt;br /&gt;“wrong,” just early.  But that didn’t make &lt;br /&gt;his experience any less painful. &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, John Paulson made the most profitable trade in history by shorting mortgage securities &lt;br /&gt;in 2006.  Many others entered into the same transactions, but too early.  When the bets failed to &lt;br /&gt;work&lt;br /&gt; at first, the appearance of being on the wrong track ate into the investors’ ability to stick &lt;br /&gt;with their decision, and they were forced to close out positions that would have been extremely &lt;br /&gt;profitable. &lt;br /&gt;In order to be a superior investor, you need the strength to diverge from the herd, stand by your &lt;br /&gt;convictions, and maintain positions until events prove them right.  Investors operating under &lt;br /&gt;harsh scrutiny and unstable&lt;br /&gt; working conditions can have a harder time doing this than others. &lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the second quote I promised from Yale’s David Swensen: &lt;br /&gt;. . . active management strate&lt;br /&gt;gies demand uninstitutional behavior from &lt;br /&gt;institutions, creating a paradox that few can unravel.    &lt;br /&gt;Charlie Munger was right about it not being easy.  I’m convinced that everything that’s &lt;br /&gt;important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that’s obvious is wrong.  Staying &lt;br /&gt;with counterintuitive, idiosyncratic positions can be extremely difficult for anyone, especially if &lt;br /&gt;they look wrong at first.  So-called “&lt;br /&gt;institutional considerations” can make it doubly hard. &lt;br /&gt;Investors who aspire to superior performance have to live with this reality.  Unconventional &lt;br /&gt;behavior is the only road to superior investment results, but it isn’t for everyone.  In &lt;br /&gt;addition to superior skill, successful investing requires the ability to look wrong for a while &lt;br /&gt;and survive some mistakes.  Thus each person has to assess whether he’s temperamentally &lt;br /&gt;equipped to do these things and whether his circumstances –&lt;br /&gt; in terms of employers, clients and &lt;br /&gt;the impact of other people’s opinions – will allow it . . . when the chips are down and the early &lt;br /&gt;going makes him look wrong, as it invariably will.  Not everyone can answer these questions in &lt;br /&gt;the affirmative.  It’s those who believe they can that should take a chance on being great. &lt;br /&gt;April 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;2014 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Risk Revisited Again &lt;br /&gt;The operators of racetracks take a dim view of bettors who engage in “past-posting”: trying to get a bet &lt;br /&gt;down after the race is over (and the horses are “past the post”).  In that vein, it’s been my practice not to &lt;br /&gt;rewrite old memos as new developments arise or new ideas strike me.  However, while preparing “Risk &lt;br /&gt;Revisited” of September 2014 for inclusion in a compilation of my memos, I thought of a number of ways &lt;br /&gt;in which it could be made better.  And since it was my original intention to have it contain everything I &lt;br /&gt;know about risk, I’ve decided to incorporate them.&lt;br /&gt;  To make it clear which sections are new, I’ve put &lt;br /&gt;them in italics. &lt;br /&gt;In April 2014, I had good resul&lt;br /&gt;ts with Dare to Be Great II, starting from the base established in an earlier &lt;br /&gt;memo (Dare to Be Great, S&lt;br /&gt;eptember 2006) and adding new thoughts that had occurred to me in the &lt;br /&gt;intervening years.  Also in 2006 I wrote Risk, my first memo devoted entirely to this key subject.  My &lt;br /&gt;thinking con&lt;br /&gt;tinued to develop, causing me to dedicate three chapters to risk among the twenty in my book &lt;br /&gt;The M&lt;br /&gt;ost Important Thing.  This memo adds to what I’ve previously written on the topic. &lt;br /&gt;What Risk Really Means &lt;br /&gt;In the 2006 memo and in the book, I argued against the purported identity between volatility and risk.  &lt;br /&gt;Volatility is the academic’s choice for defining and measuring risk.  I think this is the case largely &lt;br /&gt;because volatility is quantifiable and thus usable in the calculations and models of modern finance theory.  &lt;br /&gt;In the book I called it “machinable,” &lt;br /&gt;and there is no substitute for the purposes of the calculations. &lt;br /&gt;However, while volatility is quantifiable and machinable – and can be an indicator or symptom of &lt;br /&gt;riskiness and even a specific form of risk – I think it falls far short as “the” definition of investment risk.  &lt;br /&gt;In thinking about risk, we want to identify the thing that investors worry about and thus demand &lt;br /&gt;compensation f&lt;br /&gt;or bearing.  I don’t think most investors fear volatility.  In fact, I’ve never heard anyone &lt;br /&gt;say, “The prospective return isn’t high enough to warrant bearing all that volatility.”  What they fear is &lt;br /&gt;the possibility of permanent loss. &lt;br /&gt;Permanent loss is very different from volatility or fluctuation.  A downward fluctuation – which by &lt;br /&gt;definition is temporary – doesn’t present a big problem if the investor is able to hold on and come out the &lt;br /&gt;other side.  A permanent loss – from which there won’t be a rebound – can occur for either of two &lt;br /&gt;reasons: (a) an otherwise-temporary dip is locked in when the investor sells during a downswing – &lt;br /&gt;whether because of a loss of conviction; requirements stemming from his timeframe; financial exigency; &lt;br /&gt;or emotional pressures, or (b) the investment itself is unable to recover for fundamental reasons.  We can &lt;br /&gt;ride out volatility, but we never get a chance to undo a permanent loss. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, the problem with defining risk as the possibility of permanent loss is that it lacks the very thing &lt;br /&gt;volatility offers: quantifiability.  The probability of loss is no more measurable than the probability of &lt;br /&gt;rain.  It can be modeled, and it can be estimated (and by experts pretty well), but it cannot be known. &lt;br /&gt;In Dare to Be Great II, I described the time I spent advising a sovereign wealth fund about how to &lt;br /&gt;organize for the next thirty years.  My presentation was built significantly around my conviction that risk &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can’t be quantified a priori.  Another of their advisors, a professor from a business school north of New &lt;br /&gt;York, insisted it can.  This is something I prefer not to debate, especially with people who’re sure they &lt;br /&gt;have the answer but haven’t &lt;br /&gt;bet much money on it.   &lt;br /&gt;One of the things the professor was sure could be quantified was the maximum a portfolio could fall &lt;br /&gt;under adverse circumstances.  But how can this be so if we don’t know how adverse circumstances can be &lt;br /&gt;or how they will influence returns?  We might say “the market probably won’t fall more than x% as long &lt;br /&gt;as things aren’t worse than y and z,” but how can an absolute limit be specified?  I wonder if the professor &lt;br /&gt;had anticipated that the S&amp;P 500 could fall 57% in the global crisis. &lt;br /&gt;While writing the original memo on risk in 2006, an important thought came to me for the first time.  &lt;br /&gt;Forget about a priori; if you define risk as anything other than volatility, it can’t be measured even after &lt;br /&gt;the fact.  If you buy something for $10 and sell it a year later for $20, was it risky or not?  The novice &lt;br /&gt;would say the profit proves it was safe, while the academic would say it was clearly risky, since the only &lt;br /&gt;way to make 100% in a year is by taking a lot of risk.  I’d say it might have been a brilliant, safe &lt;br /&gt;investment that was sure to double or a risky dart throw that got lucky. &lt;br /&gt;If you make an investment in 2012, you’ll know in 2014 whether you lost money (and how much), but &lt;br /&gt;you won’t know whether it was a risky investment – that is, what the probability of loss was at the time &lt;br /&gt;you made it.  To continue the analogy, it may rain tomorrow, or it may not, but nothing that happens &lt;br /&gt;tomorrow will tell you what the probability of rain was as of today.  And the risk of rain is a very &lt;br /&gt;good analogue (although I’m sure not perfect) for &lt;br /&gt;the risk of loss.   &lt;br /&gt;People Smarter Than Me &lt;br /&gt;Peter Bernstein, who passed away in 2009, was one of the smartest people I ever met: a real investment &lt;br /&gt;sage.  He combined a brilliant and learned mind, great common sense, and the ability to express himself &lt;br /&gt;with incredible clarity.  I found a great deal of inspiration in his newsletter “Economics and Portfolio &lt;br /&gt;Strategy,” in his book “Against the Gods: The R&lt;br /&gt;emarkable Story of Risk,” and in our correspondence. &lt;br /&gt;One of the newsletter’s best issues, from June 2007, was titled “Can We Measure Risk with a Number?”  &lt;br /&gt;It provided Peter’s answer to that question, buttressed by the words of a number of great thinkers.  It’s so &lt;br /&gt;good that I want to share parts here (with all emphasis added but the first).  This memo is greatly &lt;br /&gt;enhanced by their incl&lt;br /&gt;usion: &lt;br /&gt;In life – and in i&lt;br /&gt;nvesting – the biggest risks cannot be reduced to a hard number.  As Bill &lt;br /&gt;Sharpe put it to m&lt;br /&gt;e recently, “It’s dangerous, at least in general, to think of risk as a &lt;br /&gt;number . . . .  The problem we face is that there are many scenarios that can unfold in the &lt;br /&gt;future. . . .”  John Maynard Keynes, [in the 1920s], had this to say: “There is little &lt;br /&gt;likelihood of our discovering a method of recognizing particular probabilities, without &lt;br /&gt;any assistance whatever from intuition or direct judgment. . . .  A proposition is not &lt;br /&gt;probable because we think it so.” &lt;br /&gt;Consider the following story.  In 1703, the great Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli &lt;br /&gt;wrote Leibniz he thought it strange that we knew the odds of throwing a seven instead of &lt;br /&gt;an eight with dice, but we do not know the probability that a man of twenty will outlive a &lt;br /&gt;man of sixty.  He proposed following a large number of pairs of men to see whether he &lt;br /&gt;could arrive at the probability that a man of twenty will outlive a man of sixty. &lt;br /&gt;Leibniz was unimpressed.  “Nature has established patterns originating in the return of &lt;br /&gt;events, but only for the most part. . . .  No matter how many experiments . . . you have &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;conducted, you have not thereby imposed a limit on the nature of events so that in the &lt;br /&gt;future they would not vary.”  Leibniz had written to Bernoulli in Latin, as was customary &lt;br /&gt;for exchanges between intellectuals in those days, but he put “but only for the most part” &lt;br /&gt;in Greek, to give it maximum emphasis.  If it were “always,” there would be no &lt;br /&gt;uncertainty, no risk. &lt;br /&gt;“But only for the most part” is what risk is all about: uncertainty.  The key hazard of &lt;br /&gt;quantitative risk management is &lt;br /&gt;the illusion of control the models and their results impart &lt;br /&gt;to us.  No model has an R&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt; of 1.000.  Even if you have a so-called statistically significant &lt;br /&gt;outcome, which is 95% certain – and that is surely “for the most part” – 95% still leaves &lt;br /&gt;5% you know nothing about.  The devil is in the residuals, as all of us have discovered to &lt;br /&gt;o&lt;br /&gt;ur sorrow. &lt;br /&gt;I have pursued this discussion of the nature of risk, and our inability to accurately &lt;br /&gt;measure risk, because I think it sheds important light on how we should think about the &lt;br /&gt;current environment, where the economic risks appear to be moderate and manageable &lt;br /&gt;and where the environment itself seems to have so many self-reinforcing elements.  I &lt;br /&gt;believe we have to look at the environment in qualitative terms, not quantitative terms.  &lt;br /&gt;Only then can we develop an answer to the question of whether, in today’s global &lt;br /&gt;economy, we hav&lt;br /&gt;e ended “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” as so many &lt;br /&gt;appear to believe.  [Bernstein demonstrated considerable foresight in writing this &lt;br /&gt;paragraph and the next four in the lead-up to the global financial crisis.] &lt;br /&gt;Can we sustain the low-risk character of the environment when it leads many investors &lt;br /&gt;to take high risks and to overvalue risky assets in search for higher returns? . . .  The &lt;br /&gt;more risk we take because we believe the environment is low-risk in character, the less &lt;br /&gt;the environment continues to be low-risk in character.  &lt;br /&gt;. . . The more we emphasize the low risks in the environment, the more we point out and &lt;br /&gt;explain its features, and the more we believe we understand what is going on – unique as &lt;br /&gt;this environment may be – the weaker our normal and rational inclination to risk &lt;br /&gt;aversion becomes and the more our actions alter the character of the environment. &lt;br /&gt;The economist Hyman M&lt;br /&gt;insky has reminded us, “Each state nurtures forces that lead to &lt;br /&gt;its own destruction.”  &lt;br /&gt;All of history testifies to the truth of this observation.  Greater &lt;br /&gt;liquidity [by which Bernstein meant greater availability of funds] leads firms to borrow &lt;br /&gt;more than before.  But higher levels of debt mean increasing vulnerability to adversity &lt;br /&gt;and negative shocks in an ever-changing world.  For these reasons, as Minsky put it, &lt;br /&gt;stability leads inevitably to instability. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;Even places that were&lt;br /&gt; once banana-republics, like Argentina and Brazil, are issuing &lt;br /&gt;long-term bonds and even issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies.  The &lt;br /&gt;eagerness to lend in so many different ways in so many different markets is a potent &lt;br /&gt;symptom of confidence in the underlying stability of the global system. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;Shocks and surprises are w&lt;br /&gt;hat the history of investment is all about.  Here is what G. K. &lt;br /&gt;Chesterton had to say on this matter . . . : &lt;br /&gt;The real trouble wi&lt;br /&gt;th this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable &lt;br /&gt;world, nor even that it is a reasonable one.  The commonest kind of &lt;br /&gt;trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.  Life is not an &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians.  It looks just a little more &lt;br /&gt;mathematical and regular than it is; its exactitude is obvious, but its &lt;br /&gt;inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait. &lt;br /&gt;Beginning on page 9, you’ll find a section borrowed from a memo I wrote back in 2007.  Its first bullet &lt;br /&gt;point starts off as follows: “Risk exists only in the future. . . .”  That notion holds a good part of the key to &lt;br /&gt;understanding investment risk.  If you accept that the underlying processes affecting economics, &lt;br /&gt;business and market psychology are less than 100% dependable, as seems obvious, then it follows that &lt;br /&gt;the future isn’t knowable.  In that case, risk can be nothing more than the subject of estimation – &lt;br /&gt;Keynes’s “intuition or direct judgment” (see page 2) – and certainly not reliably quantified. &lt;br /&gt;The Unknowable Future &lt;br /&gt;It seems most people in the prediction business think the future is knowable, and all they have to &lt;br /&gt;do is be among the ones who know it.  Alternatively, they may understand (consciously or &lt;br /&gt;unconsciously) that it’s not knowable but believe they have to act as if it is in order to make a &lt;br /&gt;living as an economist or investment manager.   &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I’m solidly convinced the future isn’t knowable.  I side with John Kenneth &lt;br /&gt;Galbraith who said, “We have two classes of forecasters: Those who don’t know – and those who &lt;br /&gt;don’t know they don’t know.”  There are several reasons for this inability to predict: &lt;br /&gt;We’re well aware of many factors that can influence future events, such as governmental&lt;br /&gt;actions, individuals’ spending decisions and changes in commodity prices.  But these&lt;br /&gt;things are hard to predict, and I doubt anyone is capable of taking all of them into account&lt;br /&gt;at once.  (People have suggested a parallel between this categorization and that of Donald&lt;br /&gt;Rumsfeld, who m&lt;br /&gt;ight have called these things “known unknowns”: the things we know&lt;br /&gt;we don’t know.)&lt;br /&gt;The future can also be influenced by events that aren’t on anyone’s radar today, such as&lt;br /&gt;calamities – natural or man-made – that can have great impact.  The 9/11 attacks and the&lt;br /&gt;Fukushima disaster are two examples of things no one knew to think about.  (These&lt;br /&gt;would be “unknown unknowns”: the things we don’t know we don’t know.)&lt;br /&gt;There’s far too much randomness at work in the world for future events to be predictable.&lt;br /&gt;As 2014 began, forecasters were sure the U.S. economy was gaining steam, but they were&lt;br /&gt;confounded when record cold weather caused GDP to fall 2.9% in the first quarter.&lt;br /&gt;And importantly, the connections between contributing influences and future outcomes&lt;br /&gt;are far too imprecise and variable for the results to be dependable.&lt;br /&gt;That last point deserves discussion.  Physics is a science, and for that reason an electrical engineer &lt;br /&gt;can guarantee you that if you flip a switch over here, a light will go on over there . . . every time.  &lt;br /&gt;But there’s good reason why economics is called “the dismal science,” and in fact it isn’t much of &lt;br /&gt;a science at all.  I&lt;br /&gt;n just the last few years we’ve had opportunity to see – contrary to nearly &lt;br /&gt;unanimous expectations – that interest rates near zero can fail to produce a strong rebound in &lt;br /&gt;GDP, and that a reduction of bond buying on the part of the Fed can fail to bring on higher &lt;br /&gt;interest rates.  In economics and investments, because of the key role played by human behavior, &lt;br /&gt;you just can’t say for sure that “if A, then B,” &lt;br /&gt;as you can in real science.  The weakness of the &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;connection between cause and effect makes outcomes uncertain.  In other words, it introduces &lt;br /&gt;risk. &lt;br /&gt;Given the near-infinite number of factors that influence developments, the great deal of &lt;br /&gt;randomness present, and the weakness of the linkages, it’s my solid belief that future events cannot &lt;br /&gt;be predicted with any consistency.  In particular, predictions of important divergences from trends and &lt;br /&gt;norms can’t be made with anything approaching the accuracy required for them to be helpful. &lt;br /&gt;Coping with the Unknowable Future &lt;br /&gt;Here’s the essential conundrum: investing requires us to decide how to position a portfolio for &lt;br /&gt;future developments, but the future isn’t knowable. &lt;br /&gt;Taken to slightly greater detail: &lt;br /&gt;Investing requires the taking of positions that will be affected by future developments.&lt;br /&gt;The existence of negative possibilities surrounding those future developments presents risk.&lt;br /&gt;Intelligent investors pursue prospective returns that they think compensate them for bearing the&lt;br /&gt;risk of negative future developments.&lt;br /&gt;But future developments are unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;How can investors deal wit h the limitations on their ability to know the future?  The answer lies in the &lt;br /&gt;fact that not being able to  know t  he future doesn’t mean we can’t deal with it.  It’s one thing to know &lt;br /&gt;what’&lt;br /&gt;s going to happen and something very different to have a feeling for the range of possible outcomes &lt;br /&gt;and the likelihood of each one happening.  Saying we can’t do the former doesn’t mean we can’t do the &lt;br /&gt;latter. &lt;br /&gt;The information we’re able to estimate – the list of events that might happen and how likely each one is – &lt;br /&gt;can be used to &lt;br /&gt;construct a probability distribution.  Key point number one in this memo is that the &lt;br /&gt;future should be viewed not as a fixed outcome that’s destined to happen and capable of being &lt;br /&gt;predicted, but as a range of possibilities and, hopefully on the basis of insight into their respective &lt;br /&gt;likelihoods, as a probability distribution.   &lt;br /&gt;Since t   he future isn’t fixed and future events can’t be predicted, risk cannot be quantified with any &lt;br /&gt;precision.  I made the point in Risk, and I want to emphasize &lt;br /&gt;it  here, that risk estimation has to be the &lt;br /&gt;province of experienced experts, and their work product will by necessity be subjective, imprecise, and &lt;br /&gt;more qualitative than quantitative (even if it’s  expressed in numbers).    &lt;br /&gt;There’s little I believe in more than Albert Einstein’s observation: “Not everything that counts can be &lt;br /&gt;counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”  I’d rather have an order-of&lt;br /&gt;-magnitude &lt;br /&gt;approximation of risk from an expert than a precise figure from a highly educat  ed statistician who knows &lt;br /&gt;less about t  he underlying investments.  British philosopher and logician Carveth Read put it this way: “It &lt;br /&gt;is better to be vaguely right than exactly wrong.”   &lt;br /&gt;By the way, in my personal life I tend to incorporate another of E  instein’s comments: “I never think of the &lt;br /&gt;future – it comes soon enough.”  We can’t take that   approac h as inv&lt;br /&gt;estors, however.  We have to think &lt;br /&gt;about the future.  We just shouldn’t accord too much significance to our opinions. &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t know what will happen.  We can know something about the possible outcomes (and how &lt;br /&gt;likely they are).  People who have more insight into these things than others are likely to make &lt;br /&gt;superior investors.  As I said in the last paragraph of The Most Important Thing: &lt;br /&gt;Only investors with unusual insight can regularly divine the probability distribution that &lt;br /&gt;governs future events and sense when the potential returns compensate for the risks that &lt;br /&gt;lurk in the distribution’s negative left-hand tail. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, in order to achieve superior results, an investor must be able – with some regularity &lt;br /&gt;–to find asymmetries: instances when the upside potential exceeds the downside risk.  That’s what&lt;br /&gt;successful investing is all about.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking in Terms of Diverse Outcomes &lt;br /&gt;It’s the indeterminate nature of future events that creates investment risk.  It goes without saying that if &lt;br /&gt;we knew everything that was going to happen, there wouldn’t be any risk. &lt;br /&gt;The return on a stock will be a function of the relationship between the price today and the cash flows &lt;br /&gt;(income and sale proceeds) it will produce in the future.  The future cash flows, in turn, will be a function &lt;br /&gt;of the fundamental performance of the company and the way its stock is priced given that performance.  &lt;br /&gt;We invest on the basis of expectations regarding these things.  It’s tautological to say that if the &lt;br /&gt;company’s earnings and the valuation of those earnings meet our targets, the return will be as expected.  &lt;br /&gt;The risk in the i&lt;br /&gt;nvestment therefore comes from the possibility that one or both will come in lower than &lt;br /&gt;we think. &lt;br /&gt;To oversimplify, investors in a given company may have an expectation that if A happens, that’ll make B &lt;br /&gt;happen, and if C and D also happen, then the result will be E.  Factor A may be the pace at which a new &lt;br /&gt;product finds an audience.  That will determine factor B, the growth of sales.  If A is positive, B should be &lt;br /&gt;positive.  Then if C (the cost of raw materials) is on target, earnings should grow as expected, and if D &lt;br /&gt;(investors’ valuation of the earnings) also meets expectations, the result should be a rising share price, &lt;br /&gt;giving us the r&lt;br /&gt;eturn we seek (E). &lt;br /&gt;We may have a sense for the probability distributions governing future developments, and thus a feeling &lt;br /&gt;for the likely outcome regarding each of developments A through E.  The problem is that for each of &lt;br /&gt;these, there can be lots of outcomes other than the ones we consider most likely.  The possibility of less-&lt;br /&gt;good outcomes is the source of risk.  That leads me to key point number two, as expressed by Elroy &lt;br /&gt;Dimson, a professor at the London Business School: “Risk means more things can happen than will &lt;br /&gt;happen.”  This brief, pithy sentence contains a great deal of wisdom.   &lt;br /&gt;People who rely heavily on forecasts seem to think there’s only one possibility, meaning risk can be &lt;br /&gt;eliminated if they just figure out which one it is.  The rest of us know many possibilities exist today, and &lt;br /&gt;it’s not knowable which of them will occur.  Further, things are subject to change, meaning there will be &lt;br /&gt;new possibilities tomorrow.  This uncertainty as to which of the possibilities will occur is the source &lt;br /&gt;of risk in investing. &lt;br /&gt;Even a Probability Distribution Isn’t Enough &lt;br /&gt;I’ve stressed the importance of viewing the future as a probability distribution rather than a single &lt;br /&gt;predetermined outcome.  It’s still essential to bear in mind &lt;br /&gt;key point number three: Knowing the &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;probabilities doesn’t mean you know what’s going to happen.  For example, all good backgammon &lt;br /&gt;players know the probabilities governing throws of two dice.  They know there are 36 possible outcomes, &lt;br /&gt;and that six of them add up to the number seven (1-6, 2-5, 3-4, 4-3, 5-2 and 6-1).  Thus the chance of &lt;br /&gt;throwing a seven on any toss is 6 in 36, or 16.7%.  There’s absolutely no doubt about that.  But even &lt;br /&gt;though we know the probability of each number, we’re far fr&lt;br /&gt;om knowing what number will come up on a &lt;br /&gt;given roll.   &lt;br /&gt;Backgammon players are usually quite happy to make a move that will enable them to win unless the &lt;br /&gt;opponent rolls twelve, since only one combination of the dice will produce it: 6-6.  The probability of &lt;br /&gt;rolling twelve is thus only 1 in 36, or less than 3%.  But twelve does come up from time to time, and the &lt;br /&gt;people it turns into losers end up complaining about hav&lt;br /&gt;ing done the “right” thing but lost.  As my friend &lt;br /&gt;Bruce Newberg says, “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome.”  Unlikely things &lt;br /&gt;happen – and likely things fail to happen &lt;br /&gt;– all the time.  Probabilities are likelihoods and very far from &lt;br /&gt;certainties. &lt;br /&gt;It’s true with dice, and it’s true in investing . . . and not a bad start toward conveying the essence of risk.  &lt;br /&gt;Think again about the quote above from Elroy Dimson: “Risk means more things can happen than will &lt;br /&gt;happen.”  I find it particularly helpful to invert Dimson’s observation for key point number four:  &lt;br /&gt;Even though many things can happen, only one will.   &lt;br /&gt;In Dare to Be Great II, I discussed the fact that economic decisions are usually best made on the basis of &lt;br /&gt;“expected value”: you multiply each potential outcome by its probability, sum the results, and select the &lt;br /&gt;path with the highest total.  But while expected value represents the probability-weighted average of all &lt;br /&gt;possible outcomes, we can be certain it will&lt;br /&gt; not be the outcome (unless by coincidence it’s one of the &lt;br /&gt;possibilities).  Clearly just one of the many things that can happen will happen – not the average of all of &lt;br /&gt;them.  And if some of the paths under consideration include individual outcomes that are absolutely &lt;br /&gt;unacceptable, we might not be able to choose on the basis of the highest expected value.  We may have to &lt;br /&gt;shun the quantitatively optimal path in order to avoid the possibility of an extreme negative outcome.  I &lt;br /&gt;always say I have no interest in being a skydiver who’s successful 95% of the  time. &lt;br /&gt;Investment performance (like life in general) is a lot like choosing a lottery winner by pulling one &lt;br /&gt;ticket from a bowlful.  The process through which the winning ticket is chosen can be influenced by &lt;br /&gt;physical processes, and also by randomness.  But it never amounts to anything but one ticket picked from &lt;br /&gt;among many.  Superior investors have a better sense for what’s in the bowl, and thus f   or whether &lt;br /&gt;it’ s wort  h buying a ticket in a lottery.  But even the y don’t    know for sure which one will be chosen.  &lt;br /&gt;Lesser investors have less of a sense for the probability distribution and for whether the likelihood of &lt;br /&gt;winning the prize compensates for the risk that the cost of the ticket will be lost. &lt;br /&gt;Risk and Return &lt;br /&gt;Both in the 2006 memo on risk and in my book, I showed two graphics that together make clear the &lt;br /&gt;nature of investment risk.  People have told me they’re the best   thing  in  the book, and since readers of this &lt;br /&gt;mem  o might have not seen the old one or read the book, I’m going to repeat them here. &lt;br /&gt;The first one below shows the relationship between risk and return as it is conventionally represen&lt;br /&gt;ted.  &lt;br /&gt;The  line slopes upward to the right, meaning the two are “positively correlated”: as risk increases, return &lt;br /&gt;increases.   &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the old memo and the book, I went to great lengths to clarify what this is often – but erroneously – &lt;br /&gt;taken to mean.  We hear it all the time: “Riskier investments produce higher returns” and “If you want to &lt;br /&gt;make more money, take more risk.”   &lt;br /&gt;Both of these f&lt;br /&gt;ormulations are terrible.  In brief, if riskier investments could be counted on to produce &lt;br /&gt;higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier.  Misplaced reliance on the benefits of risk bearing has led &lt;br /&gt;investors to some very unpleasant surprises. &lt;br /&gt;However, there’s a&lt;br /&gt;nother, better way to describe this relationship: “Investments that seem riskier have to &lt;br /&gt;appear likely to deliver higher returns, or else people won’t make them.”  This makes perfect sense.  If the &lt;br /&gt;market is rational, the price of a seemingly risky asset will be set low enough that the reward for holding &lt;br /&gt;it appears adequate to compensate for the risk present.  But note the word “appear.”  We’re talking about &lt;br /&gt;investors’ opinions regarding future return, not facts.  Risky investments are – by definition – far from &lt;br /&gt;certain to deliv&lt;br /&gt;er on their promise of high returns.  For that reason, I think the graphic below (with the &lt;br /&gt;probability distributions redrawn from those of the 2014 version of this memo) does a much better job of &lt;br /&gt;portraying rea&lt;br /&gt;lity: &lt;br /&gt;Here the underlying relationship between risk and return reflects the same positive general tendency as &lt;br /&gt;the first graphic, but the result of each investment is shown as a range of possibilities, not the single &lt;br /&gt;outcome suggested by the upward-sloping line.  At each point along the horizontal risk axis, an &lt;br /&gt;investment’s prospective return is shown as a bell-shaped probability distribution turned on its side.   &lt;br /&gt;The conclusions ar&lt;br /&gt;e obvious from inspection.  As you move to the right, increasing the risk: &lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the expected return increases (as with the traditional graphic),&lt;br /&gt;the range of possible outcomes becomes wider, and&lt;br /&gt;the less-good outcomes become worse.&lt;br /&gt;This is the essence of investment risk.  Riskier investments are ones where the investor is less secure &lt;br /&gt;regarding the eventual outcome and faces the possibility of faring worse than those who stick to &lt;br /&gt;safer investments, and even of losing money.  These investments are undertaken because the expected &lt;br /&gt;return is higher.  But things may happen other than that which is hoped for.  Some of the possibilities are &lt;br /&gt;superior to the expected return, but others are decidedly unattractive.   &lt;br /&gt;The first graph’s upward-sloping line indicates the underlying directionality of the risk/return &lt;br /&gt;relationship.  But there’s a lot more to consider than the fact that expected returns rise along with &lt;br /&gt;perceived risk, and in that regard the first graph is highly misleading.  The second graph shows both the &lt;br /&gt;underlying trend and the increasing potential for actual returns to deviate from expectations.  While the &lt;br /&gt;expected return rises along with risk, so does the probability of lower returns . . . and even of losses.  This &lt;br /&gt;way of looking at things reflects Professor Dimson’s dictum that more than one thing can happen.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s reality in an unpredictable world.   &lt;br /&gt;The Challenge of Managing Risk &lt;br /&gt;The foregoing has been somewhat philosophical and theoretical.  To provide a glimpse at how risk &lt;br /&gt;operates in the real world, and even though you may have read it earlier, I reproduce here (with minor &lt;br /&gt;modifications) a section that appeared with the above title in my memo “No Different This Time – The &lt;br /&gt;Lessons of ’07” (December 2007).  &lt;br /&gt;It points out some of the ways in which risk deviates in practice from &lt;br /&gt;the risk of theory.  Each of these “realities” adds a degree of complexity that wouldn’t exist if risk were &lt;br /&gt;quantifiable, linear and dependable, and thus easily treated.  But then it wouldn’t be risk. &lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons investor confidence was hit so hard [in 2007] is simply that it was too high (as is &lt;br /&gt;required for unsustainable market highs to be reached).  And much of investors’ excessive comfort was in &lt;br /&gt;the area of risk, where it was roundly believed things were under control.  But the truth is, it’s hard to &lt;br /&gt;manage risk.   &lt;br /&gt;As I stated in “Ri&lt;br /&gt;sk” (February 2006), investment risk is largely invisible – before the fact, except &lt;br /&gt;perhaps to people with unusual insight, and even after an investment has been exited.  For this reason, &lt;br /&gt;many of the great financial disasters we’ve seen have been failures to foresee and manage risk.  There &lt;br /&gt;are several reasons for this: &lt;br /&gt;Risk exists onl&lt;br /&gt;y in the future, and it’s impossible to know for sure what the future holds.&lt;br /&gt;Expectations are often formulated on the basis of what happened in the past, but the events of the&lt;br /&gt;past must be taken with a substantial grain of salt.  No ambiguity is evident when we view the past.&lt;br /&gt;Only the things that happened happened.  But that definiteness doesn’t mean the process that&lt;br /&gt;creates outcomes is clear-cut and dependable.  Many things could have happened in each case in&lt;br /&gt;the past, and the fact that only one did happen understates the potential for variability that existed.&lt;br /&gt;What I mean to say (inspired by Nicolas Nassim Taleb’s “Fooled by Randomness”) is that the history&lt;br /&gt;that took place is only one version of what it could have been.  If you accept this, then the relevance&lt;br /&gt;of history to the future is much more limited than many believe to be the case.  [Along these same&lt;br /&gt;lines, Peter Bern&lt;br /&gt;stein wrote the following in his November 2001 newsletter: “We like to rely on&lt;br /&gt;history to justify our forecasts of the long run, but history tells us over and over again that the&lt;br /&gt;unexpected and the unthinkable are the norm, not an anomaly.  That is the real lesson of history.”]&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions whether or not to bear risk are made in contemplation of normal patterns recurring, and&lt;br /&gt;they do most of the time.  But once in a while, something very different happens.  Or as my friend&lt;br /&gt;(and highly skilled investor) Ric Kayne puts it, “Most of financial history has taken place within two&lt;br /&gt;standard deviations, but everything interesting has occurred outside of two standard deviations.”&lt;br /&gt;That’s what happened in 2007.  We heard all the time that summer, “that was a 5-standard deviation&lt;br /&gt;event,” or “that was a 10-sigma event,” implying it should have happened only once every hundred&lt;br /&gt;or thousand or ten thousand years.  So how could several such events have happened in a single&lt;br /&gt;week, as was claimed in August?  The answer is that the improbability of their happening had been&lt;br /&gt;overestimated.&lt;br /&gt;Projections tend to cluster around historic norms and call for only small changes.  The point is,&lt;br /&gt;people usually expect the future to be like the past and underestimate the potential for change.  In&lt;br /&gt;August 1996, I wrote a memo showing that in the Wall Street Journal’s semi-annual poll of&lt;br /&gt;economists, on average the predictions are an extrapolation of the current condition.  And when I&lt;br /&gt;was a young analyst following Textron, building my earnings estimates based on projections for its&lt;br /&gt;four major groups, I invariably found that I had underestimated the extent of both the positive&lt;br /&gt;surprises and the shortfalls.&lt;br /&gt;We hear a lot about “worst-case” projections, but they often turn out not to be negative enough.&lt;br /&gt;What forecasters mean is “bad-case projections.”  I tell my father’s story of the gambler who lost&lt;br /&gt;regularly.  One day he heard about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money.  Half&lt;br /&gt;way around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.  Invariably things can get&lt;br /&gt;worse than people expect.  Maybe “worst-case” means “the worst we’ve seen in the past.”  But that&lt;br /&gt;doesn’t mean things can’t be worse in the future.  In 2007, many people’s worst-case assumptions&lt;br /&gt;were exceeded.&lt;br /&gt;Risk shows up lumpily.  If we say “2% of mortgages default each year,” and even if that’s true when&lt;br /&gt;we look at a multi-year average, an unusual spate of defaults can occur at a point in time, sinking a&lt;br /&gt;structured finance vehicle.  Ben Graham and David Dodd put it this way: “. . . the relation between&lt;br /&gt;different kinds of investments and the risk of loss is entirely too indefinite, and too variable with&lt;br /&gt;changing conditions, to permit of sound mathematical formulation.  This is particularly true because&lt;br /&gt;investment losses are not distributed fairly evenly in point of time, but tend to be concentrated at&lt;br /&gt;intervals . . .”  (Security Analysis, 1940 Edition).  It’s invariably the case that some investors –&lt;br /&gt;especially those who employ high leverage –&lt;br /&gt; will fail to survive at those intervals.&lt;br /&gt;People overestima&lt;br /&gt;te their ability to gauge risk and understand mechanisms they’ve never before&lt;br /&gt;seen in operation.  In theory, one thing that distinguishes humans from other species is that we can&lt;br /&gt;figure out that something’s dangerous without experiencing it.  We don’t have to burn ourselves to&lt;br /&gt;know we shouldn’t sit on a hot stove.  But in bullish times, people tend not to perform this function.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than recognize risk ahead, they tend to overestimate their ability to understand how new&lt;br /&gt;financial inventions will work.&lt;br /&gt;Finally and importantly, most people view risk taking primarily as a way to make money.  Bearing&lt;br /&gt;higher risk generally produces higher returns.  The market has to set things up to look like that’ll be&lt;br /&gt;the case; if it didn’t, people wouldn’t make risky investments.  But it can’t always work that way, or&lt;br /&gt;else risky investments wouldn’t be risky.  And when risk bearing doesn’t work, it really doesn’t&lt;br /&gt;work, and people are reminded what risk’s all about.&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, risk bearing works out just fine.  In fact, it’s often the case that the people who take the &lt;br /&gt;most risk make the most money.  However, there also are times when underestimating risk and accepting &lt;br /&gt;too much of it can be fatal.  Taking too little risk can cause you to underperform your peers –&lt;br /&gt; but that &lt;br /&gt;beats the heck out of the consequences of taking too much risk at the wrong time.  No one ever went &lt;br /&gt;bankrupt because of an excess of risk consciousness.  But a shortage of it – and the imprudent &lt;br /&gt;investments it led to – bears responsibility for a lot of what went on in 2007. &lt;br /&gt;The Many Forms of Risk &lt;br /&gt;The possibility of permanent loss may be the main risk in investing, but it’s not the only risk.  I can &lt;br /&gt;think of lots of other risks, many of which contribute to – or are components of – that main risk.     &lt;br /&gt;In the past, in addition to the risk of permanent loss, I’ve mentioned the risk of falling short.  Some &lt;br /&gt;investors face return requirements in order to make necessary payouts, as in the case of pension funds, &lt;br /&gt;endowments and insurance companies.  Others have more basic needs, like generating enough income to &lt;br /&gt;live on.   &lt;br /&gt;Some investors with needs – particularly those who live on their income, and especially in today’s low-&lt;br /&gt;return environment – face a serious conundrum.  If they put their money into safe investments, their &lt;br /&gt;returns may be inadequate.  But if they take on incremental risk in pursuit of a higher return, they &lt;br /&gt;face the possibility of a still-lower return, and perhaps of permanent diminution of their capital, &lt;br /&gt;rendering their subsequent income lower still.  There’s no easy way to resolve this conundrum. &lt;br /&gt;There are actually two possible causes of inadequate returns: (a) targeting a high return and being &lt;br /&gt;thwarted by negative events and (b) targeting a low return and achieving it.  In other words, investors &lt;br /&gt;face not on&lt;br /&gt;e but two major risks: the risk of losing money and the risk of missing opportunities.  &lt;br /&gt;Either can be eliminated but not both.  And leaning too far in order to avoid one can set you up to be &lt;br /&gt;victimized by the other.   &lt;br /&gt;Potential opportun&lt;br /&gt;ity costs – the result of missing opportunities – usually aren’t taken as seri&lt;br /&gt;ously as real &lt;br /&gt;potential losses.  But they do deserve attention.  Put another way, we have to consider the risk of not &lt;br /&gt;taking enough risk. &lt;br /&gt;These days, the fear of losing money seems to have receded (since the crisis is all of six years in the past), &lt;br /&gt;and the fear of missing opportunities is riding high, given the paltry returns available on safe, mundane &lt;br /&gt;investments.  Thus a new risk has arisen: FOMO risk, or the risk that comes from excessive fear of &lt;br /&gt;missing out.  It’s important to worry about missing opportunities, since people who don’t can invest too &lt;br /&gt;conservatively.  But when that worry becomes excessive, FOMO can drive an investor to do things he &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t do and often doesn’t understand, just because others are doing them: if he doesn’t jump on the &lt;br /&gt;bandwagon, he may&lt;br /&gt; be left behind to live with envy.   &lt;br /&gt;Over the last three years, Oaktree’s response to the paucity of return has been to develop a suite of five &lt;br /&gt;credit strategies that we hope will produce a 10% return, either net or gross (we can’t claim to be more &lt;br /&gt;precise than that).  I call them collectively the “ten percent solution,” after a Sherlock Holmes story called &lt;br /&gt;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (we aim to do better).  Talking to clients about these strategies and helping &lt;br /&gt;them choose between them has required me to focus on their risks. &lt;br /&gt;“Just a minute,” y&lt;br /&gt;ou might say, “the ten-year Treasury is paying just 2½% and, as Jeremy Grantham says, &lt;br /&gt;the risk-free rate is also return-free.  How, then, can you target returns in the vicinity of 10%?”  The &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;answer is that it can’t be done without taking risk of some kind – and there are several candidates.  I’ll list &lt;br /&gt;below a few risks that we’re consciously bearing in order to generate the returns our clients desire: &lt;br /&gt;Today’s ultra-low interest rates imply low returns for anyone who invests in what are deemed&lt;br /&gt;safe fixed income instruments.  So Oaktree’s pursuit of attractive returns centers on accepting and&lt;br /&gt;managing credit risk, or the risk that a borrower will be unable to pay interest and repay&lt;br /&gt;principal as scheduled.  Treasurys are assumed to be free of credit risk, and most high grade&lt;br /&gt;corporates are thought to be nearly so.  Thus those who intelligently accept incremental credit&lt;br /&gt;risk must do so with the expectation that the incremental return promised as compensation&lt;br /&gt;will prove su&lt;br /&gt;fficient.&lt;br /&gt;Voluntarily accepting credit risk has been at the core of what Oaktree has done since its &lt;br /&gt;beginning in 1995 (and in fact since the seed was planted in 1978, when I initiated Citibank’s &lt;br /&gt;high yield bond effort).  But bearing credit risk will lead to attractive returns only if it’s done &lt;br /&gt;well.  Our activities are based on two beliefs: (a) that because the investing establishment is &lt;br /&gt;averse to credit risk, the incremental returns we receive for bearing it will compensate generously &lt;br /&gt;for the risk entailed and (b) that credit risk is manageable – i.e., unlike the general future, credit &lt;br /&gt;risk&lt;br /&gt; can be gauged by experts (like us) and reduced through credit selection.  It wouldn’t make &lt;br /&gt;sense to voluntarily bear incremental credit risk if either of these two beliefs were lacking.  &lt;br /&gt;Another way to acce&lt;br /&gt;ss attractive returns in today’s low-rate environment is to bear illiquidity&lt;br /&gt;risk in order t&lt;br /&gt;o take advantage of investors’ normal dislike for illiquidity (superior returns often&lt;br /&gt;follow from investor aversion).  Institutions that held a lot of illiquid assets suffered considerably&lt;br /&gt;in the crisis of 2008, when they couldn’t sell them; thus many developed a strong aversion to&lt;br /&gt;them and in some cases imposed limitations on their representation in portfolios.  Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;today the flow of retail money is playing a big part in driving up asset prices and driving down&lt;br /&gt;returns.  Since retail money has a harder time making its way to illiquid assets, this has made the&lt;br /&gt;returns on the latter appear more attractive.  It’s noteworthy that there aren’t mutual funds or&lt;br /&gt;ETFs for many of the things we’re investing in.&lt;br /&gt;Some strategies introduce it voluntarily and some can’t get away from it: concentration risk.&lt;br /&gt;“Everyone knows” diversification is a good thing, since it reduces the impact on results of a&lt;br /&gt;negative development.  But some people eschew the safety that comes with diversification in&lt;br /&gt;favor of concentrating their investments in assets or with managers they expect to outperform.&lt;br /&gt;And some investment strategies don’t permit full diversification because of the limitations of&lt;br /&gt;their subject markets.  Thus problems – if and when they occur – will be bigger per se.&lt;br /&gt;Especially given today’s low interest rates, borrowing additional capital to enhance returns is&lt;br /&gt;another way to potentially increase returns.  But doing so introduces leverage risk.  Leverage&lt;br /&gt;adds to risk two ways.  The first is magnification: people are attracted to leverage because it will&lt;br /&gt;magnify gains, but under unfavorable outcomes it will magnify losses instead.&lt;br /&gt;The second way in which &lt;br /&gt;leverage adds to risk stems from funding risk, one of the classic &lt;br /&gt;reasons for financial disaster.  The stage is set when someone borrows short-term funds to make a &lt;br /&gt;long-term investment.  If the funds have to be repaid at an awkward time – due to their maturity, &lt;br /&gt;a margin call, or some other reason – and the purchased assets can’t be sold in a timely fashion &lt;br /&gt;(or can only be sold at a depressed price), an investment that might otherwise have been &lt;br /&gt;successful can be cut short and end in sorrow.  Little or nothing may remain of the sale proceeds &lt;br /&gt;once the leverage has been repaid, in which case the investor’s equity will be decimated.  This is &lt;br /&gt;commonly called a meltdown.  It’s &lt;br /&gt;the primary reason for the saying, “Never forget the six-foot-&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tall man who drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on average.”  In times of crisis, &lt;br /&gt;success over the long run can become irrelevant. &lt;br /&gt;When credit risk, illiquidity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk are borne&lt;br /&gt;intelligently, it is in the hope that the investor’s skill will be sufficient to produce success.  If&lt;br /&gt;so, the potential incremental returns that appear to be offered as risk compensation will&lt;br /&gt;turn into realized incremental returns (per the graphic at the top of page 8).  That’s the only&lt;br /&gt;reason anyone would do these things.&lt;br /&gt;As the graphic at the bottom of page 8 illustrates, however, investing further out on the risk curve &lt;br /&gt;exposes one to a broader range of investment outcomes.  In an efficient market, returns are &lt;br /&gt;tethered to the market average; in an inefficient market, they’re not.  Inefficient markets offer &lt;br /&gt;the possibility that an investor will escape from the “gravitational pull” of the market’s &lt;br /&gt;average return, but that can be either for the better or for the worse.  Superior investors –&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;those with “alpha,” or the personal skill needed to achieve outsized returns for a given level of &lt;br /&gt;risk – have scope to perform well above the mean return, while inferior investors can come out &lt;br /&gt;far below.  So hiring an investment manager introduces manager risk: the risk of pi&lt;br /&gt;cking the &lt;br /&gt;wrong one.  It’s possible to pay management fees but get decisions that detract from results rather &lt;br /&gt;than add.  &lt;br /&gt;Some or all of the above risks are potentially entailed in our new credit strategies.  Parsing them allows &lt;br /&gt;investors to choose among the strategies and accept the risks they’re more comfortable with.  The process &lt;br /&gt;can be quite informative.  &lt;br /&gt;Our oldest “new &lt;br /&gt;strategy” is Enhanced Income, where we use leverage to magnify the return from a &lt;br /&gt;portfolio of senio&lt;br /&gt;r loans.  We think senior loans have the lowest credit risk of anything Oaktree deals &lt;br /&gt;with, since they’re senior-most among their issuer’s debt and historically have produced very few credit &lt;br /&gt;losses.  Further, they’re among our most liquid assets, meaning we face relatively little illiquidity risk, &lt;br /&gt;and being active in a broad public market permits us to diversify, reducing concentration risk.  Given the &lt;br /&gt;relatively high deg&lt;br /&gt;ree of safety stemming from these loans’ seniority, returns aren’t overly dependent o&lt;br /&gt;n &lt;br /&gt;the presence of alpha, meaning Enhanced Income entails less manager risk than some other strategies.  &lt;br /&gt;But to have a chance at the healthy return we’re pursuing in Enhanced Income requires us to take some &lt;br /&gt;risk, and what we’re left with is leverage risk.  The 3-to-1 leverage in Enhanced Income Fund II will &lt;br /&gt;magnify the negative impact of any credit losses (of course we hope there won’t be many).  However, &lt;br /&gt;we’re not&lt;br /&gt; worried about a meltdown, since the current environment allows us to avoid funding risk; we &lt;br /&gt;can (a) borrow for a term that exceeds the duration of the underlying investments and (b) do so without &lt;br /&gt;the threa&lt;br /&gt;t of margin calls related to price declines. &lt;br /&gt;Strategic Credi&lt;br /&gt;t, Mezzanine Finance, European Private Debt and Real Estate Debt are the other four &lt;br /&gt;components of our “ten percent solution.”   &lt;br /&gt;All four entail some degree of credit risk, illiquidity risk (they all invest heavily or entirely in&lt;br /&gt;private debt) and concentration risk (as their market niches offer only a modest number of&lt;br /&gt;investment opportunities, and securing them in today’s competitive environment is a challenge).&lt;br /&gt;The Real Estate Debt Fund can only lever up to 1-to-1, and the other three borrow only small&lt;br /&gt;amounts and for short-term purposes, so none of them entails significant leverage risk.&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in order to succeed they’ll all require a high level of skill from their managers in&lt;br /&gt;identifying return prospects and keeping risk under control.  Thus they all entail manager risk.&lt;br /&gt;Our response is to entr&lt;br /&gt;ust these portfolios only to managers who’ve been with us for years.&lt;br /&gt;It’s reasonable – es&lt;br /&gt;sential, really – to study the risk entailed in every investment and accept the &lt;br /&gt;amounts and types of ri&lt;br /&gt;sk that you’re comfortable with (assuming this can be discerned).  It’s not &lt;br /&gt;reasonable to expect&lt;br /&gt; highly superior returns without bearing some incremental risk. &lt;br /&gt;I touched above on concentr&lt;br /&gt;ation risk, but we should also think about the flip side: the risk of over-&lt;br /&gt;diversification.  If you have just a few holdings in a portfolio, or if an institution employs just a few &lt;br /&gt;managers, one bad decision can do significant damage to results.  But if you have a very large number of &lt;br /&gt;holdings or managers, no one of them can have much of a positive impact on performance.  Nobody &lt;br /&gt;invests in just the one stock or manager they expect to perform best, but as the number of positions is &lt;br /&gt;expanded, the standards for inclusion may decline.  Peter Lynch coined the term “diworstification” to &lt;br /&gt;describe the process through which lesser investments are added to portfolios, making the potential risk-&lt;br /&gt;adjusted return worse.     &lt;br /&gt;While I don’t think &lt;br /&gt;volatility and risk are synonymous, there’s no doubt that volatility does present risk.  &lt;br /&gt;If circumstances cause you to sell a volatile investment at the wrong time, you might turn a downward &lt;br /&gt;fluctuation into a permanent loss.  Moreover, even in the absence of a need for liquidity, volatility can &lt;br /&gt;prey on investors’ emotions, reducing the probability they’ll do the right thing.  And in the short run, it &lt;br /&gt;can be very hard to differentiate between a downward fluctuation and a permanent loss.  Often this &lt;br /&gt;can really be done onl&lt;br /&gt;y in retrospect.  Thus it’s clear that a professional investor may have to bear &lt;br /&gt;consequences for a temporary downward fluctuation simply because of its resemblance to a permanent &lt;br /&gt;loss.  When you’re under pressure, the distinction between “volatility” and “loss” can seem only &lt;br /&gt;semantic.  Volatility is not “the” definition of investment risk, as I said earlier, but it isn’t irrelevant. &lt;br /&gt;One example of a risk connected with volatility – or the deviation of price from what might be intrinsic &lt;br /&gt;value – is basis risk.  Arbitrageurs customarily set up positions where they’re long one asset and short a &lt;br /&gt;related asset.  The two assets are expected to move roughly in parallel, except that the one that’s slightly &lt;br /&gt;cheaper should make more money for the investor in the long run than the other loses, producing a small &lt;br /&gt;net gain with little risk.  Because these trades are considered so low in risk, they’re often levered up to the &lt;br /&gt;sky.  But sometimes&lt;br /&gt; the prices of the two assets diverge to an unexpected extent, and the equity invested &lt;br /&gt;in the trade evaporates.  That unexpected divergence is basis risk, and it’s what happened to Long-Term &lt;br /&gt;Capital Management in 1998, one of the most famous meltdowns of all time.  As Long-Term’s chairman &lt;br /&gt;John Meriwether said at the time, “the Fund added to its positions in anticipation of convergence, yet . . . &lt;br /&gt;the trades diverged dramatically.”  This benign-sounding explanation was behind a collapse some thought &lt;br /&gt;capable of bringing down the global financial system. &lt;br /&gt;Long-Term’s fail&lt;br /&gt;ure was also attributable to model risk.  Decisions can be turned over to quants or &lt;br /&gt;financial engineers who either (a) conclude wrongly that an unsystematic process can be modeled or (b) &lt;br /&gt;employ the wrong model.  During the financial crisis, models often assumed that events would occur &lt;br /&gt;according to a “normal distribution,” but extreme “tail events” occurred much more often than the normal &lt;br /&gt;distribution says they will.  Not only can extreme events exceed a model’s assumptions, but excessive &lt;br /&gt;belief in a model’s efficacy can induce people to take risks they would never take on the basis of &lt;br /&gt;qualitative judgment.  They’re often disappointed to find they had put too much faith in a statistical sure &lt;br /&gt;thing. &lt;br /&gt;Model risk can arise from black swan risk, for which I borrow the title of Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s &lt;br /&gt;popular second book.  People tend to confuse “never been seen” with “impossible,” and the consequences &lt;br /&gt;can be dire when something occurs for the first time.  That’s part of the reason why people lost so much &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in highly levered subprime mortgage securities.  The fact that a nationwide spate of mortgage defaults &lt;br /&gt;hadn’t happened convinced investors that it couldn’t happen, and their certainty caused them to take &lt;br /&gt;actions so imprudent that it had to happen.   &lt;br /&gt;As long as we’re on the subject of things going wrong, we should touch on the subject of career risk.  As &lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in Dare to Be Great II, “agents” who manage money for others can be penalized for &lt;br /&gt;investments that look like losers (that is, for both permanent losses and temporary downward &lt;br /&gt;fluctuations).  Either of these unfortunate experiences can result in headline risk if the resulting losses &lt;br /&gt;are big enough to make it into the media, and some careers can’t withstand headline risk.  Investors who &lt;br /&gt;lack the potential to share commensurately in investment successes face a reward asymmetry that can &lt;br /&gt;force them toward the safe end of the risk/return curve.  They are likely to think more about the risk of &lt;br /&gt;losing money than about the risk of missing opportunities.  Thus their portfolios may lean too far toward &lt;br /&gt;controlling risk&lt;br /&gt; and avoiding embarrassment (and they may not take enough chances to generate returns).  &lt;br /&gt;There are consequences for these investors, as well as for those who employ them. &lt;br /&gt;Event risk is another risk to worry about, something that was created by bond issuers about twenty years &lt;br /&gt;ago.  Since corporate directors have a fiduciary responsibility to stockholders but not to bondholders, &lt;br /&gt;some think they can (and perhaps should) do anything that’s not explicitly prohibited to transfer value &lt;br /&gt;from bondholders to stockholders.  Bondholders need covenants to shield them from this kind of pro-&lt;br /&gt;active plundering, but at times like today it can be hard to obtain strong protective covenants. &lt;br /&gt;There are many ways for an investment to be unsuccessful.  The two main ones are fundamental risk &lt;br /&gt;(relating to how a company or asset performs in the real world) and valuation risk (relating to how the &lt;br /&gt;market prices that performance).  For years investors, fiduciaries and rule-makers acted on the belief that &lt;br /&gt;it’s safe to buy high-quality assets and risky to buy low-quality assets.  But between 1968 and 1973, many &lt;br /&gt;investors in the “Nifty Fifty” (the stocks of the fifty fastest-growing and best companies in America) lost &lt;br /&gt;80-90% of their money.  Attitudes have evolved since then, and today there’s less of an assumption that &lt;br /&gt;high quality prevents fundamental risk, and much less preoccupation with quality for its own sake.   &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, investors are more sensitive to the pivotal role played by price.  At bottom, the &lt;br /&gt;riskiest thing is overpaying for an asset (regardless of its quality), and the best way to reduce risk is &lt;br /&gt;by paying a price that’s irrationally low (ditto).  A low price provides a “margin of safety,” and that’s &lt;br /&gt;what risk-controlled investing is all about.  Valuation risk should be easily combatted, since it’s &lt;br /&gt;largely within the investor’s control.  All you have to do is refuse to buy if the price is too high given &lt;br /&gt;the fundamentals.  “Who wouldn’t do that?” you might ask.  Just think about the people who bought into &lt;br /&gt;the tech bubble. &lt;br /&gt;Fundamental risk and val&lt;br /&gt;uation risk bear on the risk of losing money in an individual security or asset, &lt;br /&gt;but that’s far from the whole story.  Correlation is the essential additional piece of the puzzle.  &lt;br /&gt;Correlation is the degree to which an asset’s price will move in sympathy with the movements of others.  &lt;br /&gt;The higher the correlation among its components, all other things being equal, the less effective &lt;br /&gt;diversification a portfolio has, and the more exposed it is to untoward developments.   &lt;br /&gt;An asset doesn’t have “a correlation.”  Rather, it has a different correlation with every other asset.  A &lt;br /&gt;bond has a certain correlation with a stock.  One stock has a certain correlation with another stock (and a &lt;br /&gt;different correlation with a third).  Stocks of one type (such as emerging market, high-tech or large-cap) &lt;br /&gt;are likely to be highly correlated with others within their category, but they may be either high or low in &lt;br /&gt;correlation with those in other categories.  Bottom line: it’s hard to estimate the riskiness of a given &lt;br /&gt;asset, but many times harder to estimate its correlation with all the other assets in a portfolio, and &lt;br /&gt;thus the impact on performance of adding it to the portfolio.  This is a real art. &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.15All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed income investors are directly exposed to another form of risk: interest rate risk.  Higher interest &lt;br /&gt;rates mean lower bond prices – that relationship is absolute.  The impact of changes in interest rates on &lt;br /&gt;asset classes other than fixed income is less direct and less obvious, but it &lt;br /&gt;also pervades the markets.  &lt;br /&gt;Note that stocks usually go down when the Fed says the economy is performing strongly.  Why?  The &lt;br /&gt;thinking is that stronger economy = higher interest rates = more competition for stocks from bonds = &lt;br /&gt;lower stock valuations.  Or it might be stronger economy = higher interest rates = reduced stimulus = &lt;br /&gt;weaker economy. &lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons for increases in interest rates relates to purchasing power risk.  Investors in securities &lt;br /&gt;(and especially long-term bonds) are exposed to the risk that if inflation rises, the amount they receive in &lt;br /&gt;the future will buy less than it could today.  This causes investors to insist on higher interest rates and &lt;br /&gt;higher prospective returns to protect them against the loss of purchasing power.  The result is lower &lt;br /&gt;prices. &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I want to mention a new concept I hear about once in a while: upside risk.  Forecasters are &lt;br /&gt;sometimes heard to say “the risk is on the upside.”  At first this doesn’t seem to have much legitimacy, &lt;br /&gt;but it can be about the possibility that the economy may catch fire and do better than expected, earnings &lt;br /&gt;may come in above consensus, or the stock market may appreciate more than people think.  Since these &lt;br /&gt;things are positives, there’s risk in being underexposed to them. &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;To move to the biggest of big pictures, I want to make a few over-arching comments about risk. &lt;br /&gt;The first is that risk is counterintuitive. &lt;br /&gt;The riskiest thing in the world is the widespread belief that there’s no risk.&lt;br /&gt;Fear that the market is risky (and the prudent investor behavior that results) can render it quite&lt;br /&gt;safe.&lt;br /&gt;As an asset declines in price, making people view it as riskier, it becomes less risky (all else being&lt;br /&gt;equal).&lt;br /&gt;As an asset appreciates, causing people to think more highly of it, it becomes riskier.&lt;br /&gt;Holding only “safe” assets of one type can render a portfolio under-diversified and make it&lt;br /&gt;vulnerable to a single shock.&lt;br /&gt;Adding a few “risky” assets to a portfolio of safe assets can make it safer by increasing its&lt;br /&gt;diversification.  Pointing this out was one of Professor William Sharpe’s great contributions.&lt;br /&gt;The second is that risk aversion is the thing that keeps markets safe and sane.   &lt;br /&gt;When investors are risk-conscious, they will demand generous risk premiums to compensate&lt;br /&gt;them for bearing risk.  Thus the risk/return line will have a steep slope (the unit increase in&lt;br /&gt;prospective return per unit increase in perceived risk will be large) and the market should reward&lt;br /&gt;risk-bearing as theory asserts.&lt;br /&gt;But when people forget to be risk-conscious and fail to require compensation for bearing risk,&lt;br /&gt;they’ll make risky investments even if r&lt;br /&gt;isk premiums are skimpy.  The slope of the line will be&lt;br /&gt;gradual, and risk taking is likely to eventually be penalized, not rewarded.&lt;br /&gt;When risk aversion is running high, investors will perform extensive due diligence, make&lt;br /&gt;conservative assumptions, apply skepticism and deny capital to risky schemes.&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.16All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when risk tolerance is widespread instead, these things will fall by the wayside and deals will&lt;br /&gt;be done that set the scene for subsequent losses.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, risk is low when risk aversion and risk consciousness are high, and high when they’re low. &lt;br /&gt;The third is that risk is often hidden and thus deceptive.  Loss occurs when risk – the possibility of &lt;br /&gt;loss – collides with negative events.  Thus the riskiness of an investment becomes apparent only when it &lt;br /&gt;is tested in a negative environment.  It can be risky but not show losses as long as the environment &lt;br /&gt;remains salutary.  The fact that an investment is susceptible to a serious negative development that will &lt;br /&gt;occur only infrequently – what I call “the improbable disaster” – can make it appear safer than it really is.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus after several years of a benign environment, a risky investment can easily pass for safe.  That’s why &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett famously said, “. . . you only find out who’s swimming naked when the tide goes out.”   &lt;br /&gt;Assembling a portfolio that incorporates risk control as well as the potential for gains is a great &lt;br /&gt;accomplishment.  But it’s a hidden accomplishment most of the time, since risk only turns into loss &lt;br /&gt;occasionally . . . when the tide goes out. &lt;br /&gt;The fourth is that&lt;br /&gt; risk is multi-faceted and hard to deal with.  In this memo I’ve mentioned 24 &lt;br /&gt;different for&lt;br /&gt;ms of risk: the risk of losing money, the risk of falling short, the risk of missing opportunities, &lt;br /&gt;FOMO risk, credit risk, illiquidity risk, concentration risk, leverage risk, funding risk, manager risk, over-&lt;br /&gt;diversification risk, risk associated with volatility, basis risk, model risk, black swan risk, career risk, &lt;br /&gt;headline risk, event risk, fundamental risk, valuation risk, correlation risk, interest rate risk, purchasing &lt;br /&gt;power risk, and upside &lt;br /&gt;risk.  And I’m sure I’ve omitted some.  Many times these risks are overlapping, &lt;br /&gt;contrasting and hard to manage simultaneously.  For example:  &lt;br /&gt;Efforts to redu&lt;br /&gt;ce the risk of losing money invariably increase the risk of missing out.&lt;br /&gt;Efforts to reduce fundamental risk by buying higher-quality assets often increase valuation risk,&lt;br /&gt;given that higher-quality assets often sell at elevated valuation metrics.&lt;br /&gt;At bottom, it’s th&lt;br /&gt;e inability to arrive at a single formula that simultaneously minimizes all the risks that &lt;br /&gt;makes investing&lt;br /&gt; the fascinating and challenging pursuit it is. &lt;br /&gt;The fifth is that the task of managing risk shouldn’t be left to designated risk managers.  I’m &lt;br /&gt;convinced outsiders to the fundamental investment process can’t know enough about the subject assets to &lt;br /&gt;make appropriate decisions regarding each one.  All they can do is apply statistical models and norms.  &lt;br /&gt;But those models may be the wrong ones for the underlying assets – or just plain faulty – and there’s little &lt;br /&gt;evidence that t&lt;br /&gt;hey add value.  In particular, risk managers can try to estimate correlation and tell you how &lt;br /&gt;things will behave when combined in a portfolio.  But they can fail to adequately anticipate the “fault &lt;br /&gt;lines” that run through portfolios.  And anyway, as the old saying goes, “in times of crisis all correlations &lt;br /&gt;go to one” and everything collapses in unison. &lt;br /&gt;“Value at Risk” was &lt;br /&gt;supposed to tell the banks how much they could lose on a very bad day.  During the &lt;br /&gt;crisis, however, Va&lt;br /&gt;R was often shown to have understated the risk, since the assumptions hadn’t been &lt;br /&gt;harsh enough.  Given the fact that risk managers are required at banks and de rigueur elsewhere, I think &lt;br /&gt;mor&lt;br /&gt;e money was spent on risk management in the early 2000s than in the rest of history combined . . .  &lt;br /&gt;and yet we experienced the worst financial crisis in 80 years.  Investors can calculate risk metrics like &lt;br /&gt;VaR and Sharpe ratios (we use them at Oaktree; they’re the best tools we have), but they shouldn’t put &lt;br /&gt;too much faith in them.  The bottom line for me is that risk management should be the responsibility &lt;br /&gt;of every participant in the investment process, applying experience, judgment and knowledge of the &lt;br /&gt;underlying investments.   &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.17All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth is that while risk should be dealt with constantly, investors are often tempted to do so only &lt;br /&gt;sporadically.  Since risk only turns into loss when bad things happen, this can cause investors to apply &lt;br /&gt;risk control only when the future seems ominous.  At other times they may opt to pile on risk in the &lt;br /&gt;expectation that good things lie ahead.  But since we can’t predict the future, we never really know when &lt;br /&gt;risk control will be needed.  Risk control is unnecessary in times when losses don’t occur, but that doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;mean it’s wrong to have it.  The best analogy is to fire insurance: do you consider it a mistake to have &lt;br /&gt;paid the premium in a year in which your house didn’t burn down? &lt;br /&gt;Taken together these six observations convince me that Charlie Munger’s trenchant comment on &lt;br /&gt;investing in general – “It’s not supposed to be easy.  Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.” – is &lt;br /&gt;profoundly applicable to risk management.  Effective risk management requires deep insight and a deft &lt;br /&gt;touch.  It has to be based on a superior understanding of the probability distributions that will govern &lt;br /&gt;future events.  Those who would achieve it have to have a good sense for what the crucial moving parts &lt;br /&gt;are, what will influence them, what outcomes are possible, and how likely each one is.  Following on &lt;br /&gt;with Charlie’s idea, thinking risk control is easy is perhaps the greatest trap in investing, since &lt;br /&gt;excessive confidence that they have risk under control can make investors do very risky things. &lt;br /&gt;Thus the key prerequisites for risk control also include humility, lack of hubris, and knowing what &lt;br /&gt;you don’t know.  No one ever got into trouble for confessing a lack of prescience, being highly risk-&lt;br /&gt;conscious, and even i&lt;br /&gt;nvesting scared.  Risk control may restrain results during a rebound from crisis &lt;br /&gt;conditions or extreme under-valuations, when those who take the most risk generally make the most &lt;br /&gt;money.  But it will also extend an investment career and increase the likelihood of long-term success.  &lt;br /&gt;That’&lt;br /&gt;s why Oaktree was built on the belief that risk control is “the most important thing.” &lt;br /&gt;Lastly while dealing in generalities, I want to point out that whereas risk control is indispensable, &lt;br /&gt;risk avoidance isn’t an appropriate goal.  The reason is simple: risk avoidance usually goes hand-&lt;br /&gt;in-hand with return avoidance.  While you shouldn’t expect to make money just for bearing risk, &lt;br /&gt;you also shouldn’t expect to make money without bearing risk. &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;At present I consider risk control more important than usual.  To put it briefly: &lt;br /&gt;Today’s ultra-low interest rates have brought the prospective returns on money market&lt;br /&gt;instruments, Treasurys and high grade bonds to nearly zero.&lt;br /&gt;This has caused money to flood into riskier assets in search of higher returns.&lt;br /&gt;This, in turn, has caused some investors to drop their usual caution and engage in aggressive&lt;br /&gt;tactics.&lt;br /&gt;And this, finally, has caused standards in the capital markets to deteriorate, making it easy for&lt;br /&gt;issuers to place risky securities and – consequently – hard for investors to buy safe ones.&lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett put it best, and I regularly return to his statement on the subject: &lt;br /&gt;. . . the less prudence&lt;br /&gt; with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence &lt;br /&gt;with which we should conduct our own affairs. &lt;br /&gt;While investor behavior hasn’&lt;br /&gt;t sunk to the depths seen just before the crisis (and, in my opinion, that &lt;br /&gt;contributed greatly to it), in many ways it has entered the zone of imprudence.  To borrow a metaphor &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.18All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from Chuck Prince, Citigroup’s CEO from 2003 to 2007, anyone who’s totally unwilling to dance to &lt;br /&gt;today’s fast-paced music can find it challenging to put money to work. &lt;br /&gt;It’s the job of investors to strike a proper balance between offense and defense, and between worrying &lt;br /&gt;about losing money and worrying about missing opportunity.  Today I feel it’s important to pay more &lt;br /&gt;attention to loss prevention than to the pursuit of gain.  For the last four years Oaktree’s mantra has &lt;br /&gt;been “move forward, but with caution.”  At this time, in reiterating that mantra, I would increase the &lt;br /&gt;emphasis on those last three words: “but with caution.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Economic and company fundamentals in the U.S. are fine today, and asset prices – while full – don’t &lt;br /&gt;seem to be at bubble levels.  But when undemanding capital markets and a low level of risk aversion &lt;br /&gt;combine to encourage investors to engage in risky practices, something usually goes wrong eventually.  &lt;br /&gt;Although I have no idea what could make the day of reckoning come sooner rather than later, I &lt;br /&gt;don’t think it’s too early to take today’s carefree market conditions into consideration.  What I do &lt;br /&gt;know i&lt;br /&gt;s that those conditions are creating a degree of risk for which there is no commensurate risk &lt;br /&gt;premium.  We have to behave accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;June 8, 2015 (updating Risk Revisited published September 3, 2014)&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.19All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard M&lt;br /&gt;arks   &lt;br /&gt;Re:   It’s Not Easy &lt;br /&gt;In 2011, as I was put&lt;br /&gt;ting the finishing touches on my book The Most Important Thing, I was fortunate to &lt;br /&gt;have one of my occasional lunches with Charlie Munger.  As it ended and I got up to go, he said &lt;br /&gt;something about investing that I keep going back to: “It’s not supposed to be easy.  Anyone who finds &lt;br /&gt;it easy is stupid.” &lt;br /&gt;As usual, Cha&lt;br /&gt;rlie packed a great deal of wisdom into just a few words.  Let’s take the first six: “It’s not &lt;br /&gt;supposed to be easy.”  While it’s pretty simple to achieve average results, it shouldn’t be easy to make &lt;br /&gt;superior investments and earn outsized returns.  John Kenneth Galbraith said something similar years ago: &lt;br /&gt;There is not&lt;br /&gt;hing reliable to be learned about making money.  If there were, study would &lt;br /&gt;be intense and everyone with a positive IQ would be rich. &lt;br /&gt;What Charlie and&lt;br /&gt; Professor Galbraith meant is this: Everyone wants to make money, and especially to &lt;br /&gt;find the sure thing or “silver bullet” that will allow them to do it without commensurate risk.  Thus they &lt;br /&gt;work hard (actually, study is intense), searching for bargain securities and approaches that will give them &lt;br /&gt;an edge.  They buy up the bargains and apply the approaches.  The result is that the efforts of these &lt;br /&gt;market participants tend to drive out opportunities for easy money.  Securities become more fairly priced, &lt;br /&gt;and free lunches become harder to find.  It makes no sense to think it would be otherwise. &lt;br /&gt;And what about th&lt;br /&gt;e next seven words: “Anyone who finds it easy is stupid”?  It follows from the above &lt;br /&gt;that given how hard investors work to find special opportunities, and that their buying eliminates such &lt;br /&gt;prospects, people who think it can be easy overlook substantial nuance and complexity.  &lt;br /&gt;Markets are meeti&lt;br /&gt;ng places where people come together (not necessarily physically) to exchange one &lt;br /&gt;thing (usually money) for another.  Markets have a number of functions, one of which is to eliminate &lt;br /&gt;opportunities for excess returns. &lt;br /&gt;Ed calls me&lt;br /&gt; and bids $10,000 for my car.  Then he offers to sell it to Bob for $20,000.  If Ed’s lucky and &lt;br /&gt;we both say yes, he doubles his money overnight.  To put it simply, anyone who expects to make money &lt;br /&gt;easily trading cars this way either thinks (a) Bob and I are idiots or (b) the market won’t function in a way &lt;br /&gt;that enables us to know about the fair value of my car.  If these conditions were met, it would be an &lt;br /&gt;“inefficient market.”   &lt;br /&gt;But if Bob and I ha&lt;br /&gt;ve access to market data on used car pricing, Ed’s chances of pulling off this deal are &lt;br /&gt;greatly reduced.  In most markets, transparency tends to reveal and thus preclude obvious &lt;br /&gt;mispricings.  (Thanks to the incredible gains in access to data by way of the Internet, this is certainly &lt;br /&gt;more true today than ever before.)  In my view, this is a good part of the basis for Charlie’s comment: &lt;br /&gt;anyone who thinks it’s easy to achieve unusual profits is overlooking the way markets operate.  This &lt;br /&gt;memo is largely about the challenges they present. &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-Level Th&lt;br /&gt;inking &lt;br /&gt;I always thought&lt;br /&gt; that when I retired, I would write a book pulling together the elements of investment &lt;br /&gt;philosophy discussed in my memos.  But in 2009, I got a letter    from Warren Buffett saying that if I’d &lt;br /&gt;write a book, he’d give me a blurb for the jacket.  It didn’t take me long to move up my timing.   &lt;br /&gt;Columbia Busines&lt;br /&gt;s School Publishing had been talking to me about a book, and when I told them I was &lt;br /&gt;ready, they asked to see a sample chapter.  For some reason, I was able to sit down – without previously &lt;br /&gt;having given the topic any organized thought – and knock out a chapter about the importance of &lt;br /&gt;something I labeled “second-level thinking.”  This is a crucial subject that has to be understood by &lt;br /&gt;everyone who aspires to be a superior investor.  And yet I’ve never covered it explicitly for the readers of &lt;br /&gt;my memos.  I want to correct that now. &lt;br /&gt;In what ended up bei&lt;br /&gt;ng the book’s first chapter, I introduced the subject as follows: &lt;br /&gt;Remember your go&lt;br /&gt;al in investing isn’t to earn average returns; you want to do better than &lt;br /&gt;average.  Thus your thinking has to be better than that of others – both more powerful and &lt;br /&gt;at a higher level.  Since others may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, &lt;br /&gt;you must find an edge they don’t have.  You must think of something they haven’t &lt;br /&gt;thought of, see things they miss, or bring insight they don’t possess.  You have to react &lt;br /&gt;differently and behave differently.  In short, being right may be a necessary condition for &lt;br /&gt;investment success, but it won’t be sufficient.  You must be more right than others . . . &lt;br /&gt;which by definition means your thinking has to be different. . . . &lt;br /&gt;For your perform&lt;br /&gt;ance to diverge from the norm, your expectations – and thus your &lt;br /&gt;portfolio – have to diverge from the norm, and you have to be more right than the &lt;br /&gt;consensus.  Different and better: that’s a pretty good description of second-level thinking. &lt;br /&gt;Second-level th&lt;br /&gt;inking is what immediately pops into my mind when I think about Charlie’s observation.  &lt;br /&gt;And it’s a good general heading under which to discuss the great many things that make superior &lt;br /&gt;investing a challenge.  In short, to borrow from Charlie, anyone who thinks it’s easy must be a first-&lt;br /&gt;level thinker.  Let me use some simple examples from the book to illustrate the difference. &lt;br /&gt;•First  -level thi&lt;br /&gt;nking says, “It’s a good company; let’s buy the stock.”  Second-level&lt;br /&gt;thinking says, “It’s a good company, but everyone thinks it’s a great company, and&lt;br /&gt;it’s not.  So the stock’s overrated and overpriced; let’s sell.”&lt;br /&gt;•First  -level &lt;br /&gt;thinking says, “The outlook calls for low growth and rising inflation.&lt;br /&gt;Let’s dump our stocks.”  Second-level thinking says, “The outlook stinks, but&lt;br /&gt;everyone else is selling in panic.  Buy!”&lt;br /&gt;•First  -level &lt;br /&gt;thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall; sell.”  Second-&lt;br /&gt;level thinking says, “I think the company’s earnings will fall far less than people&lt;br /&gt;expect, and the pleasant surprise will lift the stock; buy.”&lt;br /&gt;First  -level thi&lt;br /&gt;nking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad &lt;br /&gt;sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority).  All the first-level thinker needs is &lt;br /&gt;an opinion about the future, as in, “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning &lt;br /&gt;the stock will go up.” &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-level&lt;br /&gt; thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.  The second-level thinker takes &lt;br /&gt;many things into account: &lt;br /&gt;•What is the&lt;br /&gt; range of likely future outcomes?&lt;br /&gt;•Which outcome do I think will occur?&lt;br /&gt;•What’s the probability I’m right?&lt;br /&gt;•What does the consensus think?&lt;br /&gt;•How does my expectation differ from the consensus?&lt;br /&gt;•How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the&lt;br /&gt;future, and with mine?&lt;br /&gt;•Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?&lt;br /&gt;•What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what&lt;br /&gt;if I’m right?&lt;br /&gt;The botto&lt;br /&gt;m line is that first-level thinkers see what’s on the surface, react to it simplistically, and buy or &lt;br /&gt;sell on the basis of their reactions.  They don’t understand their setting as a marketplace where asset &lt;br /&gt;prices reflect and depend on the expectations of the participants.  They ignore the part that others &lt;br /&gt;play in how prices change.  And they fail to understand the implications of all this for the route to &lt;br /&gt;success. &lt;br /&gt;For exampl&lt;br /&gt;e, when I lived in Los Angeles, a stockbroker often spoke on the radio station I listened to &lt;br /&gt;while driving to work.  His advice was simple: “If there’s a company whose product you like, buy the &lt;br /&gt;stock.”  That’s first-level thinking.  How seductively easy.  But also how error-prone, in that it ignores the &lt;br /&gt;possibility that a company with a good product can have a bad business; the good product can become &lt;br /&gt;obsolete; or the stock can be priced too high to be a good investment.   &lt;br /&gt;On the other ha&lt;br /&gt;nd, second-level thinkers double-think (and triple-think) every angle of every situation.  A &lt;br /&gt;good example can be seen in the hypothetical newspaper contest John Maynard Keynes wrote about in &lt;br /&gt;1936.  Readers would be shown 100 photos and asked to choose the six prettiest girls, with prizes going &lt;br /&gt;to the readers who chose the girls readers voted for most often.  Naive entrants would try to win by &lt;br /&gt;picking the prettiest girls.  But note that the contest would reward the readers who chose not the &lt;br /&gt;prettiest girls, but the most popular.  Thus the road to winning would lie not in figuring out which were &lt;br /&gt;the prettiest, but in predicting which girls the average entrant would consider prettiest.  Clearly, to do so, &lt;br /&gt;the winner would have to be a second-level thinker.  (The first-level thinker wouldn’t even recognize the &lt;br /&gt;difference.) &lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia&lt;br /&gt; points out that one vying to win the contest might go beyond this distinction: &lt;br /&gt;This can be ca&lt;br /&gt;rried one step further to take into account the fact that other entrants would &lt;br /&gt;each have their own opinion of what public perceptions are.  Thus the strategy can be &lt;br /&gt;extended to the next order and the next and so on, at each level attempting to predict the &lt;br /&gt;eventual outcome of the process based on the reasoning of other agents. &lt;br /&gt;“It is not a ca&lt;br /&gt;se of choosing those [faces] that, to the best of one’s judgment, are really &lt;br /&gt;the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest.  We have &lt;br /&gt;reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average &lt;br /&gt;opinion expects the average opinion to be.  And there are some, I believe, who practice &lt;br /&gt;the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.” (Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, &lt;br /&gt;Interest and Money, 1936). &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynes create&lt;br /&gt;d his contest to make a point about the stock market.  In the short run, beating the market &lt;br /&gt;requires the ability to predict which stocks will win the popularity contest among investors.  Higher-level &lt;br /&gt;thinkers who recognize this dynamic have a head start toward earning the greatest gains.  Ben Graham &lt;br /&gt;applied the same thinking when he described the market as a “voting machine” in the short run (although &lt;br /&gt;he made plain his belief that it’s a “weighing machine” in the long run). &lt;br /&gt;The first-level&lt;br /&gt; thinker simply looks for the highest-quality company, the best product, the fastest &lt;br /&gt;earnings growth or the lowest p/e ratio.  He’s ignorant of the very existence of a second level at &lt;br /&gt;which to think, and of the need to pursue it. &lt;br /&gt;The second-le&lt;br /&gt;vel thinker goes through a much more complex process when thinking about buying an &lt;br /&gt;asset.  Is it good?  Do others think it’s as good as I think it is?  Is it really as good as I think it is?  Is it as &lt;br /&gt;good as others think it is?  Is it as good as others think others think it is?  How will it change?  How do &lt;br /&gt;others think it will change?  How is it priced given: its current condition; how I think its condition will &lt;br /&gt;change; how others think it will change; and how others think others think it will change?  And that’s just &lt;br /&gt;the beginning.  No, this isn’t easy.   &lt;br /&gt;(Please note &lt;br /&gt;that the above discussion is entirely on the subject of short-term investing, and I go &lt;br /&gt;through it only to provide a graphic illustration of the difference between first-level and second-&lt;br /&gt;level thinking.  Oaktree and I aren’t focused on short-term results, and the thinking we apply to &lt;br /&gt;long -run considerations is quite different.  We think much less about what others will make &lt;br /&gt;popular in the short run; instead, we rely on the eventual functioning of the weighing machine.  The &lt;br /&gt;highest priority – by far – should be an objective evaluation of fundamentals.  Market participants can get &lt;br /&gt;so caught up in predicting other participants’ behavior that they ignore value and fail to buy bargains out &lt;br /&gt;of fear that the assets in question will remain unpopular or become more so.  This creates great &lt;br /&gt;opportunities for those investors whose willingness to think independently and endure the short-term pain &lt;br /&gt;that comes with temporary unpopularity enables them to purchase attractive investments from the bargain &lt;br /&gt;counter.) &lt;br /&gt;What Keynes’&lt;br /&gt;s hypothetical contest shows most clearly is that the route to success in the competitive &lt;br /&gt;arena may not be what it seems at first glance.  When the goal is to lift the greatest weight, achieve the &lt;br /&gt;lowest score on the golf course, get the highest grade on a math test or finish a crossword puzzle in the &lt;br /&gt;shortest time, the competition is against oneself and the objective challenge at hand.  But when the goal, &lt;br /&gt;as it is in investing, is to outdo other people in a largely mental pursuit involving a lot of psychology – &lt;br /&gt;while they’re trying to do the same to you – the challenge is much more complex.   &lt;br /&gt;The invest&lt;br /&gt;or’s basic goal of buying desirable assets at fair prices is sensible and straightforward.  &lt;br /&gt;But the deeper you look, the more you see how many aspects of successful investing are &lt;br /&gt;counterintuitive and how much of what seems obvious is wrong.  There’s a lot more that matters, of &lt;br /&gt;course, but these realizations are key. &lt;br /&gt;The Things Eve&lt;br /&gt;ryone Likes &lt;br /&gt;The most ou&lt;br /&gt;tstanding characteristic of first-level thinkers – and of the investing herd – is that they &lt;br /&gt;like things with obvious appeal.  These are the things that are easy to understand and easy to buy.  But &lt;br /&gt;that’s unlikely to be the path to investment success.  Here’s how I put it in “Everyone Knows” (April &lt;br /&gt;2007): &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s clea&lt;br /&gt;r to the broad consensus of investors is almost always wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;First, most&lt;br /&gt; people don’t understand the process through which something comes to &lt;br /&gt;have outstanding moneymaking potential.  And second, the very coalescing of &lt;br /&gt;popular opinion behind an investment tends to eliminate its profit potential. &lt;br /&gt;Take, for exam&lt;br /&gt;ple, the investment that “everyone” believes to be a great idea.  In my &lt;br /&gt;view by definition it simply cannot be so.   &lt;br /&gt;•If everyone&lt;br /&gt; likes it, it’s probably because it has been doing well.  Most people seem&lt;br /&gt;to think outstanding performance to date presages outstanding future performance.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it’s more likely that outstanding performance to date has borrowed from the&lt;br /&gt;future and thus presages sub-par performance from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;•If everyone likes it, it’s likely the price has risen to reflect a level of adulation from&lt;br /&gt;which relatively little further appreciation is likely.  (Sure it’s possible for something&lt;br /&gt;to move from “overvalued” to “more overvalued,” but I wouldn’t want to count on it&lt;br /&gt;happening.)&lt;br /&gt;•If everyone&lt;br /&gt; likes it, it’s likely the area has been mined too thoroughly – and has seen&lt;br /&gt;too much capital flow in – for many bargains to remain.&lt;br /&gt;•If every&lt;br /&gt;one likes it, there’s significant risk that prices will fall if the crowd changes&lt;br /&gt;its collective mind and moves for the exit.&lt;br /&gt;Superior inve&lt;br /&gt;stors know – and buy – when the price of something is lower than it should &lt;br /&gt;be.  And the price of an investment can be lower than it should be only when most people &lt;br /&gt;don’t see its merit.  Yogi Berra is famous for having said, “Nobody goes to that restaurant &lt;br /&gt;anymore; it’s too crowded.”  It’s just as nonsensical to say, “Everyone realizes that &lt;br /&gt;investment’s a bargain.”  If everyone realizes it, they’ll have bought, in which case the &lt;br /&gt;price will no longer be low. &lt;br /&gt;So the thi&lt;br /&gt;ngs with the most obvious merit become the things that everyone likes.  They’re also likely &lt;br /&gt;to be the things that are most hotly pursued and most highly priced, and thus least promising and &lt;br /&gt;most treacherous.  What are some examples? &lt;br /&gt;When I first&lt;br /&gt; showed up for work in First National City Bank’s investment research department in 1968, &lt;br /&gt;the bank was investing heavily in the “Nifty Fifty”: the stocks of America’s best, fastest growing &lt;br /&gt;companies.  Since these were companies where nothing could go wrong, the official dictum said it didn’t &lt;br /&gt;matter much what price you paid.  It didn’t seem unreasonable to pay p/e ratios of 80 or 90 given these &lt;br /&gt;companies’ growth rates.   &lt;br /&gt;But it turned out that the price you pay does matter, and 80-90 times earnings had been too high.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;when the market ran into trouble in the early     1970s, many of these stocks lost the vast majority of their &lt;br /&gt;value, and investors learned the hard way that it’s possible to like a good thing too much.  Unsurprisingly, &lt;br /&gt;it also turned out that predictions of a flawless future can be wrong, as once-dominant companies such as &lt;br /&gt;Kodak, Polaroid and Xerox eventually went bankrupt or required turnarounds.   &lt;br /&gt;Roughly ten yea&lt;br /&gt;rs ago, everyone was gaga over real estate, especially residential.  This was underpinned &lt;br /&gt;by some bits of “accepted wisdom” that seemed compelling, such as “you can always live in it,” “home &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prices alway&lt;br /&gt;s go up” and “real estate is a hedge against inflation.”  Conservative debt investors (rather &lt;br /&gt;than buyers of homes themselves) were persuaded to buy levered and tranched mortgage-backed &lt;br /&gt;securities by the fact that “there has never been a nationwide wave of mortgage defaults.” &lt;br /&gt;But in 2007 it &lt;br /&gt;turned out that home prices can go down as well as up, and mortgage loans extended &lt;br /&gt;casually based on their flawless record can have flaws.  Homes and mortgages, bought when everyone &lt;br /&gt;liked them, turned out to be terrible investments. &lt;br /&gt;The    fact   is,  painful bubbles can’t come into existence if there isn’t an underlying grain of truth.  The Nifty &lt;br /&gt;Fifty were generally terrific companies.  Home prices do tend to rise over time and offset inflation.  &lt;br /&gt;Mortgages generally are repaid or carry adequate collateral.  The Internet would change the world.  Oil at &lt;br /&gt;$147/barrel was indispensable and in short supply.  But in each case the merits were too obvious; the &lt;br /&gt;investment ideas became too popular; and asset prices consequently became dangerously high. &lt;br /&gt;Followin&lt;br /&gt;g the trends that are popular at a point in time certainly isn’t a formula for investment &lt;br /&gt;success, since popularity is likely to lead investors on a path that is comfortable but pointed in the &lt;br /&gt;wrong direction.  Here’s more from “Everyone Knows”: &lt;br /&gt;The fact i&lt;br /&gt;s, there is no dependable sign pointing to the next big moneymaker: a good idea &lt;br /&gt;at a too-low price.  Most people simply don’t know how to find it. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;Large amount&lt;br /&gt;s of money (and by that I mean unusual returns, or unusual risk-adjusted &lt;br /&gt;returns) aren’t made by buying what everybody likes.  They’re made by buying what &lt;br /&gt;everybody underestimates.   &lt;br /&gt;In short, t&lt;br /&gt;here are two primary elements in superior investing: &lt;br /&gt;•seeing some&lt;br /&gt; quality that others don’t see or appreciate (and that isn’t reflected in the&lt;br /&gt;price), and&lt;br /&gt;•having it turn out to be true (or at least accepted by the market).&lt;br /&gt;It should be &lt;br /&gt;clear from the first element that the process has to begin with investors &lt;br /&gt;who are unusually perceptive, unconventional, iconoclastic or early.  That’s why &lt;br /&gt;successful investors are said to spend a lot of their time being lonely.   &lt;br /&gt;Risk and Counterintuitiveness &lt;br /&gt;If what’s obv&lt;br /&gt;ious and what everyone knows is usually wrong, then what’s right?  The answer comes from &lt;br /&gt;inverting the concept of obvious appeal.  The truth is, the best buys are usually found in the things most &lt;br /&gt;people don’t understand or believe in.  These might be securities, investment approaches or investing &lt;br /&gt;concepts, but the fact that something isn’t widely accepted usually serves as a green light to those who’re &lt;br /&gt;perceptive (and contrary) enough to see it.  A great example can be found in the area of risk (again from &lt;br /&gt;“Everyone Knows”): &lt;br /&gt;“I wouldn’t&lt;br /&gt; buy that at any price – everyone knows it’s too risky.”  That’s something &lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard a lot in my life, and it has given rise to the best investment opportunities I’ve &lt;br /&gt;participated in.  In fact, to an extent, it has provided the foundation for my career.  In the &lt;br /&gt;1970s and 1980s, insistence on avoiding non-investment grade bonds kept them out of &lt;br /&gt;most institutional portfolios and therefore cheap.  Ditto for the debt of bankrupt &lt;br /&gt;companies: what could be riskier? &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the herd is wrong about risk at least as often as it is about return.  A &lt;br /&gt;broad consensus that something’s too hot to handle is almost always wrong.  Usually it’s &lt;br /&gt;the opposite that’s true.   &lt;br /&gt;I’m firmly &lt;br /&gt;convinced that investment risk resides most where it is least perceived, &lt;br /&gt;and vice versa:    &lt;br /&gt;•When everyone b&lt;br /&gt;elieves something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually&lt;br /&gt;reduces its price to the point where it’s not risky at all.  Broadly negative opinion can&lt;br /&gt;make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its price.&lt;br /&gt;•And, of course, a&lt;br /&gt;s demonstrated by the experience of Nifty Fifty investors, when&lt;br /&gt;everyone believes something embodies no risk, they usually bid it up to the point&lt;br /&gt;where it’s enormously risky.  No risk is feared, and thus no reward for risk bearing –&lt;br /&gt;no “risk premium” – is demanded or provided.  That can make the thing that’s most&lt;br /&gt;esteemed the riskiest.&lt;br /&gt;This paradox exists because most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the &lt;br /&gt;determinant of whether something’s risky.  But high-quality assets can be risky, and &lt;br /&gt;low-   quality assets can be safe.  It’s just a matter of the price paid for them.  &lt;br /&gt;For me, &lt;br /&gt;it follows from the above that the bottom line is simple: the riskiest thing in the world is the &lt;br /&gt;widespread belief that there’s no risk.  That’s what most people believed in 2006-07, and that belief &lt;br /&gt;abetted the careless behavior that brought on the Great Financial Crisis.  Only an understanding that risk &lt;br /&gt;was high could have discouraged that behavior and rendered the world safe. &lt;br /&gt;I call thi&lt;br /&gt;s “the perversity of risk.”  For most people it’s hard to grasp that a perception of safety brings &lt;br /&gt;on risk, and a perception of risk can lead to safety.  But it’s clear for the deeper second-level thinker.  This &lt;br /&gt;is just another example of the fact that what “everyone knows” is what shapes the environment, bringing &lt;br /&gt;high prices when things are perceived to be good, and vice versa. &lt;br /&gt;A perception that fundamental risk is low and the future is positive causes investors to be optimistic.  &lt;br /&gt;This, in turn, causes asset prices to rise, and thus investment risk to be high.  The problem that befalls &lt;br /&gt;most people – the first-level thinkers – is that they fail to distinguish between fundamental risk and &lt;br /&gt;investment risk.   &lt;br /&gt;What has to&lt;br /&gt; be remembered is the defining role of price.  Regardless of whether the fundamental &lt;br /&gt;outlook is positive or negative, the level of investment risk is determined largely by the relationship &lt;br /&gt;between the price of an asset and its intrinsic value.  There is no asset so good that it can’t become &lt;br /&gt;overpriced and thus risky, and few so bad that there’s no price at which they’re a buy (and safe).  This is &lt;br /&gt;one of the greatest examples of counterintuitiveness.  Only those who are able to see its logic can &lt;br /&gt;hope to be superior investors. &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Else? &lt;br /&gt;I’ve covered &lt;br /&gt;a few of the most important topics under the headings of complexity and counter-&lt;br /&gt;intuitiveness:  &lt;br /&gt;•the import&lt;br /&gt;ance of second-level thinking,&lt;br /&gt;•the lack of identity between “good company” and “good investment,”&lt;br /&gt;•the unhelpfulness of the things everyone knows, and&lt;br /&gt;•the perversity of risk.&lt;br /&gt;I see, howeve&lt;br /&gt;r, that I’ve already filled seven pages.  So rather than continue to provide a full treatment of &lt;br /&gt;all the topics I want to cover, let’s conduct an exercise.  I’ll list below a number of elements of time-&lt;br /&gt;honored investment wisdom.  See if you can tell which are helpful and which aren’t:   &lt;br /&gt;•The market i&lt;br /&gt;s “efficient,” meaning asset prices reflect all available information and thus provide&lt;br /&gt;accurate estimates of intrinsic value.&lt;br /&gt;•Because people are risk-averse, risky deals are discouraged and the market awards appropriate&lt;br /&gt;risk premiums as compensation for incremental risk.&lt;br /&gt;•Risky investments produce high returns.&lt;br /&gt;•Adding risky assets to a portfolio makes it riskier.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s desirable that everything in a well-diversified portfolio performs well.&lt;br /&gt;•Understanding the science of economics will enable you to safely harness the macro future.&lt;br /&gt;•Sometimes the outlook is clear, and sometimes it’s complicated and unpredictable.  You have to&lt;br /&gt;be careful when it’s the latter   .&lt;br /&gt;•Correct forecasts lead to investment gains.&lt;br /&gt;•A forecast has to be correct in order to be profitable.&lt;br /&gt;•The earning of a profit proves the investor made a good decision.&lt;br /&gt;•A low price makes for an attractive investment.&lt;br /&gt;•Assets that are appreciating deserve your attention.&lt;br /&gt;•Contrarianism will bring consistent success.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s important to do what feels right.&lt;br /&gt;•Assets with greater liquidity are safer.&lt;br /&gt;•The level of risk in a portfolio can be kept low by applying a simple formulaic process.&lt;br /&gt;My answer &lt;br /&gt;is that all sixteen reflect potential misconceptions, and they have to be (a) understood at the &lt;br /&gt;second level, not the first, and (b) dismissed as always holding the keys to success.  Here’s why: &lt;br /&gt;•The market i&lt;br /&gt;s “efficient,” meaning asset prices reflect all available information and thus&lt;br /&gt;provide accurate estimates of intrinsic value – The efficient market hypothesis assumes people&lt;br /&gt;are rational and objective.  But since emotion so often rules in place of reason, the market doesn’t&lt;br /&gt;necessarily reflect what’s true, but rather what investors think is true.  Thus prices can range all&lt;br /&gt;over the place.  Sometimes they’re fair, but sometimes they’re way too high or low.  It’s a big&lt;br /&gt;mistake to impute rationality to the market and believe its message.&lt;br /&gt;•Because people a&lt;br /&gt;re risk-averse, risky deals are discouraged and the market awards&lt;br /&gt;appropriate risk premiums as compensation for incremental risk – The truth is that investors’&lt;br /&gt;risk -averseness fluctuates between too much and too little.  When it’s the latter, skepticism and&lt;br /&gt;conservatism dry up, due diligence is inadequate, risky deals are easy to pull off, and&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compensati&lt;br /&gt;on for risk bearing usually turns out to be insufficient.  Investors absolutely cannot &lt;br /&gt;depend on the market to discipline itself. &lt;br /&gt;•Risky inves&lt;br /&gt;tments produce high returns – This is one of the greatest of the old saws, and one&lt;br /&gt;of the wrongest.&lt;br /&gt;oA collection &lt;br /&gt;of low-risk investments can produce a high return if the low-risk character of&lt;br /&gt;the components permits them to perform dependably and keeps there from being any big&lt;br /&gt;losers to pull down the overall result.  An absence of losses can give you a great start&lt;br /&gt;toward a good outcome.  This is the cornerstone of Oaktree’s investment philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;oOn the other hand, high-risk investments can’t be counted on for high returns.  If they&lt;br /&gt;could, they wouldn’t be high-risk.  High-risk investments can fail to provide the high&lt;br /&gt;returns they seemed to promise if the analysis underlying them proves to have been ill-&lt;br /&gt;founded or if they run into negative developments.&lt;br /&gt;The presum&lt;br /&gt;ed positive relationship between risk and return is predicated on the assumption that &lt;br /&gt;there’s no such thing as investment skill and value-adding decision making.  If markets are &lt;br /&gt;efficient and there’s no skill, it’s reasonable to believe that higher returns can be attained only &lt;br /&gt;through the bearing of increased risk.  But if outstanding skill is present, there’s no reason to &lt;br /&gt;think it can’t be used to create portfolios with low risk and high return potential. &lt;br /&gt;•Adding ri&lt;br /&gt;sky assets to a portfolio makes it riskier – One of Nobel prize-winner William&lt;br /&gt;Sharpe’s greatest contributions to investment theory came in the realization that if a portfolio&lt;br /&gt;holds only low-risk assets, the addition of a risky asset can make it safer.  This happens because&lt;br /&gt;doing so increases the portfolio’s diversification and reduces the correlation among its&lt;br /&gt;components, reducing its vulnerability to a single negative development.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s desirab&lt;br /&gt;le that everything in a well-diversified portfolio performs well – The truth is, if all&lt;br /&gt;the holdings were to perform well in one scenario, they could all perform poorly in another.  That&lt;br /&gt;means the benefits of diversification wouldn’t be enjoyed.  It shouldn’t be surprising – or totally&lt;br /&gt;disappointing – to have some laggards in a portfolio that’s truly well-diversified.&lt;br /&gt;•Understandi&lt;br /&gt;ng the science of economics will enable you to safely harness the macro future –&lt;br /&gt;There are no immutable rules in play.  “In economics and investments, because of the key role&lt;br /&gt;played by human nature, you just can’t say for sure that ‘if A, then B,’ as you can in real science.&lt;br /&gt;The weakness of the connection between cause and effect makes outcomes uncertain.  In other&lt;br /&gt;words, it introduces risk.”  (“Risk Revisited,” September 2014).&lt;br /&gt;•Sometimes&lt;br /&gt; the outlook is clear, and sometimes it’s complicated and unpredictable.  You&lt;br /&gt;have to be careful when it’s the latter – The truth is, the future is never worry-free.  Sometimes&lt;br /&gt;it seems to be, because no risks are apparent.  But the skies are never as clear as they seem at their&lt;br /&gt;clearest.  Which is more treacherous: when everyone understands that the future presents&lt;br /&gt;risks, or when they believe it to be knowable and benign?  As I mentioned earlier, I worry&lt;br /&gt;about the latter much more than the former.&lt;br /&gt;•Correct forecast&lt;br /&gt;s lead to investment gains – The easiest way to have a correct forecast is to&lt;br /&gt;extrapolate a trend and see it continue as expected.  Most forecasters do a lot of extrapolating,&lt;br /&gt;meaning their forecasts are usually broadly shared.  Thus when the trend does continue,&lt;br /&gt;everyone’s right.  But since everyone held the same view, the continuing trend was probably&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discounted i&lt;br /&gt;n advance in the price of the asset, and the fact that it rolls on as expected doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;necessarily produce profit.  For a forecast to be highly profitable, it has to be idiosyncratic.  But, &lt;br /&gt;given how often trends continue, idiosyncratic forecasts aren’t often right. &lt;br /&gt;•A forecast h&lt;br /&gt;as to be correct in order to be profitable – Just as correct forecasts aren’t&lt;br /&gt;necessarily profitable, profitable forecasts don’t have to be correct.  A forecast – even if it’s not&lt;br /&gt;correct – can be profitable if it’s merely less wrong than others.  If a trend that everyone else&lt;br /&gt;extrapolates turns out not to continue, a prediction of the deviation can be very profitable . . . even&lt;br /&gt;if it’s not exactly on target.&lt;br /&gt;•The earning of a profit proves the investor made a good decision – One of the first things I&lt;br /&gt;learned at Wharton was that you can’t necessarily tell the quality of a decision from the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;Given the unpredictability of future events and, especially, the presence of randomness in the&lt;br /&gt;world, a lot of well-reasoned decisions produce losses, and plenty of poor decisions are&lt;br /&gt;profitable.  Thus one good year or a few big winners may tell us nothing about an investor’s skill.&lt;br /&gt;We have to see a lot of outcomes and a long history – and especially a history that includes some&lt;br /&gt;tough years – before we can say whether an investor has skill or not.&lt;br /&gt;•A low price&lt;br /&gt; makes for an attractive investment – I talked at the bottom of page seven about the&lt;br /&gt;importance of price in determining whether an investment is risky.  But if you reread the part in&lt;br /&gt;bold, you’ll see it doesn’t say a low price is the essential element.  An asset may have a low&lt;br /&gt;absolute dollar price, a low price compared to the past, or a low p/e ratio, but usually the price has&lt;br /&gt;to be low relative to the asset’s intrinsic value for the investment to be attractive and for  the risk&lt;br /&gt;to be low.  It’s easy for investors to get into trouble if they fail to understand the difference&lt;br /&gt;between cheapness and value.&lt;br /&gt;•Assets that ar&lt;br /&gt;e appreciating deserve your attention – Most people impute intelligence to the&lt;br /&gt;market, and thus they think rising prices signal fundamental merit.  They may be attracted to&lt;br /&gt;“momentum investing,” which is based on the belief that something that has been appreciating is&lt;br /&gt;likely to continue doing so.  But the truth is, the higher the price (everything else being equal), the&lt;br /&gt;less attractive an asset is.  Momentum investing works until it stops, at which time the things that&lt;br /&gt;have been doing worst – and may be most undervalued – take over market leadership.&lt;br /&gt;•Contraria&lt;br /&gt;nism will bring consistent success – It’s true that the investing herd is often wrong.&lt;br /&gt;In particular, it behaves more aggressively the more prices rise, and more cautiously the more&lt;br /&gt;they fall – the opposite of what should happen.  But doing the opposite of what the crowd does&lt;br /&gt;isn’t a sure thing either.  Much of the time there isn’t anything dramatic to either do or avoid.&lt;br /&gt;Contrarianism is most effective at the extremes, and then only for those who understand what the&lt;br /&gt;herd is doing and why it’s wrong.  And they still have to summon the nerve to do the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s importa&lt;br /&gt;nt to do what feels right – The best investors know intellectually what the right&lt;br /&gt;thing to do is.  But while this knowledge gives them comfort, they have to tamp down their&lt;br /&gt;feelings in order to follow it.  The best ideas are ones others haven’t tumbled to, and as I wrote in&lt;br /&gt;“Dare to Be Great,” “Non-consensus ideas have to be lonely.  By definition, non-consensus ideas&lt;br /&gt;that are popular, widely held or intuitively obvious are an oxymoron. . . .  Most great&lt;br /&gt;investments begin in discomfort.”  Good investors are subjected to the same misleading&lt;br /&gt;influences and emotions as everyone else.  They’re just more capable of keeping them under&lt;br /&gt;control.&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Assets with greater liquidity are safer – Greater liquidity generally means you can get out of an&lt;br /&gt;asset easier and closer to the price of the last trade.  But first, liquidity can dry up when other&lt;br /&gt;investors change their mind about the asset.  And second, the theoretical ability to get out when&lt;br /&gt;you want says nothing about fundamental safety and relatively little about investment safety in&lt;br /&gt;the long run.  It’s much safer to be in well-analyzed assets with good fundamentals and attractive&lt;br /&gt;prices, in which case you can hold for a long time without needing to exit.  The best defense&lt;br /&gt;against a lack of liquidity is arranging your affairs so there’s little need for it.&lt;br /&gt;•The level of r&lt;br /&gt;isk in a portfolio can be kept low by applying a simple formulaic process –&lt;br /&gt;Rather, risk comes in many forms and they can be overlapping, contrasting and hard to manage.&lt;br /&gt;For example, as I said in “Risk Revisited,” efforts to reduce the risk of losing money invariably&lt;br /&gt;increase the risk of missing out on gains, and efforts to reduce fundamental risk by buying higher-&lt;br /&gt;quality assets often increase valuation risk, given that higher-quality assets often sell at elevated&lt;br /&gt;valuation metrics.&lt;br /&gt;What does the ab&lt;br /&gt;ove consist of?  It’s a collection of time-honored bromides that range from (a) only &lt;br /&gt;effective part of the time to (b) just plain wrong.  These investment myths are pervasive but of little help.  &lt;br /&gt;That fact leaves the investor to struggle in a complex, challenging environment. &lt;br /&gt;Recent Exper&lt;br /&gt;ience   &lt;br /&gt;The recent vo&lt;br /&gt;latility in the world’s markets, the S&amp;P 500’s 11% drop between August 17 and 25, and the &lt;br /&gt;decline of nearly 40% in Chinese equities have given investors an opportunity to experience something &lt;br /&gt;else that’s not easy: portfolio management under adverse conditions.  A few lessons are worth noting, &lt;br /&gt;none of which are always easy to employ: &lt;br /&gt;•Emotion is o&lt;br /&gt;ne of the investor’s greatest enemies.  Fear makes it hard to remain optimistic about&lt;br /&gt;holdings whose prices are plummeting, just as envy makes it hard to refrain from buying the&lt;br /&gt;appreciating assets that everyone else is enjoying owning.  As I mentioned just above, everyone is&lt;br /&gt;buffeted by the same influences and emotions.  Superior investors may not be insulated, but&lt;br /&gt;they manage to act as if they are.&lt;br /&gt;•Confidence i&lt;br /&gt;s one of the key emotions, and I attribute a lot of the market’s recent volatility to a&lt;br /&gt;swing from too much of it a short while ago to too little more recently.  The swing may have&lt;br /&gt;resulted from disillusionment: it’s particularly painful when investors recognize that they&lt;br /&gt;know far less than they had thought about how the world works.  In this case, when China’s&lt;br /&gt;growth slowed, its currency depreciated and its market corrected, I think a lot of investors&lt;br /&gt;realized they don’t know what the implications of these things are for the economies of the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;and the world.  It’s important to remain moderate as to confidence, but instead it’s usually the&lt;br /&gt;case that confidence – like other emotions – swings radically.&lt;br /&gt;•Especiall&lt;br /&gt;y during downdrafts, many investors impute intelligence to the market and look to it to&lt;br /&gt;tell them what’s going on and what to do about it.  This is one of the biggest mistakes you can&lt;br /&gt;make.  As Ben Graham pointed out, the day-to-day market isn’t a fundamental analyst; it’s&lt;br /&gt;a barometer of investor sentiment.  You just can’t take it too seriously.  Market participants&lt;br /&gt;have limited insight into what’s really happening in terms of fundamentals, and any intelligence&lt;br /&gt;that could be behind their buys and sells is obscured by their emotional swings.  It would be&lt;br /&gt;wrong to interpret the recent worldwide drop as meaning the market “knows” tough times lay&lt;br /&gt;ahead.  Rather, China came out with some negative news and people panicked, especially&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese inve&lt;br /&gt;stors who had bought stocks on margin and perhaps were experiencing their first &lt;br /&gt;serious market correction.  Their selling prompted investors in the U.S. and elsewhere to sell also, &lt;br /&gt;believing that the market decline in China signaled serious implications for the Chinese economy &lt;br /&gt;and others.  The analysis of fundamentals and valuation should dictate an investor’s &lt;br /&gt;behavior, not the actions of others.  If you let the investing herd – which determines market &lt;br /&gt;movements – tell you what to do, how can you expect to outperform?   &lt;br /&gt;•While China&lt;br /&gt; was the “proximate cause” of the volatility, other things often contribute, and last&lt;br /&gt;month was no exception.  The word that always comes to mind for me is “confluence.”&lt;br /&gt;Investors can usually keep their heads in the face of one negative.  But when they face more&lt;br /&gt;than one simultaneously, they often lose their cool.  One additional negative last month was the&lt;br /&gt;glitch in Bank of New York Mellon’s SunGard software, and the bank’s consequent inability to&lt;br /&gt;price 1,200 mutual funds and ETFs that it administers.  It was another dose of disillusionment: no&lt;br /&gt;one enjoys learning that the market mechanisms they need to work can’t be depended on.&lt;br /&gt;•In good times – perhaps emulating Warren Buffett – investors talk about how much they’d like to&lt;br /&gt;see the stocks they own decline in price, since it would allow them to add to positions at lower&lt;br /&gt;levels.  But when prices collapse, the chance to average down is usually a lot less welcome&lt;br /&gt;. . . and a lot harder to act on.&lt;br /&gt;•Investors can&lt;br /&gt; be tempted to sell during corrections like this one.  Oftentimes emotional behavior&lt;br /&gt;is cloaked in intelligent-sounding rationalizations like “it’s important to sell down to your&lt;br /&gt;comfort level.”  But the valid reasons to sell are principally because you feel fundamentals have&lt;br /&gt;deteriorated or because the price has risen enough.  Selling to get more comfortable as prices&lt;br /&gt;fall (just like buying for that purpose in a rising market) has nothing to do with the&lt;br /&gt;relationship between price and value.&lt;br /&gt;•Another reas&lt;br /&gt;on to sell, of course, is fear that the slide will continue.  But if you’re tempted to do&lt;br /&gt;so, ask yourself first whether you think the stock market is going to rise or fall tomorrow, and&lt;br /&gt;second how much you’d bet on it.  If you can tackle those decisions in your head rather than your&lt;br /&gt;gut, you’ll probably admit you have no idea what’s going to happen in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;•Regardles&lt;br /&gt;s of the outlook for fundamentals or the relationship between price and value, many&lt;br /&gt;people sell in a downdraft because, well, you have to do something, and they feel it’s&lt;br /&gt;unreasonably passive to just sit there.  But something about which I feel strongly is that it’s&lt;br /&gt;not the things you buy and sell that make you money; it’s the things you hold.  Of course you&lt;br /&gt;have to buy things in order to hold them.  But my point is that transactions merely adjust what&lt;br /&gt;you own, and engaging in them doesn’t necessarily increase potential profit.  Sticking with what&lt;br /&gt;you own may be enough – although it may not be easy in tough times.&lt;br /&gt;•In my memo on li&lt;br /&gt;quidity in March, I borrowed an idea from my son Andrew: If you look&lt;br /&gt;longingly at the chart for a stock that has risen for twenty years, think about how many days there&lt;br /&gt;were when you would’ve had to talk yourself out of selling.  That’s not always easy.  Two of the&lt;br /&gt;main reasons people sell stocks are because they go up and because they go down.  When they go&lt;br /&gt;up, people who hold them become afraid that if they don’t sell, they’ll give back their profit, kick&lt;br /&gt;themselves, and be second-guessed by their bosses and clients.  And when they go down, they&lt;br /&gt;worry that they’ll fall further.&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be&lt;br /&gt; absolutely no intellectual justification for that feeling.  If you liked it a month ago &lt;br /&gt;at $80, should you sell it now just because it’s at $60?  The best way to get through a &lt;br /&gt;downdraft is to verify your thesis, tighten your seatbelt and hang on.  If you sell just &lt;br /&gt;because there’s a downdraft (or an updraft), you’ll never get that twenty-year winner.  &lt;br /&gt;When you look closely, you’ll see that every twenty-year rise included a lot of ups and downs.  &lt;br /&gt;To enjoy long-term success, you have to hold through them. &lt;br /&gt;•A lot has be&lt;br /&gt;en written of late about reduced liquidity in the current investment environment, in&lt;br /&gt;part a result of restrictions under the Volcker rule.  This may have contributed to last month’s&lt;br /&gt;volatility, but it should be viewed as having exacerbated the short-term pain, not as altering the&lt;br /&gt;long- term fundamentals.&lt;br /&gt;Coping with a de&lt;br /&gt;clining market seems easy ahead of time, since emotions aren’t in play and investors &lt;br /&gt;know what they should do.  It’s only when prices start falling in earnest, as they have recently, that it &lt;br /&gt;turns out to be harder than expected. &lt;br /&gt;So What Will&lt;br /&gt; Work? &lt;br /&gt;Superior inv&lt;br /&gt;esting isn’t easy.  I’ve set forth a number of examples of its complexity, and a long list of &lt;br /&gt;simplistic rules that can’t be depended on.  Among the many things that keep investing from being easy is &lt;br /&gt;the fact that no tactic works every time.  Almost every tool an investor might employ is a two-edged &lt;br /&gt;sword.  Here’s how I put it last year in “Dare to Be Great II”: &lt;br /&gt;•If you invest, you w&lt;br /&gt;ill lose money if the market declines.&lt;br /&gt;•If you don’t invest, you will miss out on gains if the market rises.&lt;br /&gt;•Market timing will add value if it can be done right.&lt;br /&gt;•Buy  -and-hold will produce better results if timing can’t be done right.&lt;br /&gt;•Aggressiveness will help when the market rises but hurt when it falls.&lt;br /&gt;•Defensiveness will help when the market falls but hurt when it rises.&lt;br /&gt;•If you concentrate your portfolio, your mistakes will kill you.&lt;br /&gt;•If you diversify, the payoff from your successes will be diminished.&lt;br /&gt;•If you employ le&lt;br /&gt;verage, your successes will be magnified.&lt;br /&gt;•If you employ leverage, your mistakes will be magnified.&lt;br /&gt;Each of these pairings indicates symmetry.  None of the tactics listed will add value if it’s &lt;br /&gt;right but not subtract if it’s wrong.  Thus none of these tactics, in and of itself, can hold &lt;br /&gt;the secret to dependably above average investment performance. &lt;br /&gt;There’s o&lt;br /&gt;nly one thing in the investment world that isn’t two-edged, and that’s &lt;br /&gt;“alpha”: superior insight or skill.  Skill can help in both up markets and down markets. &lt;br /&gt;And by making it more likely that your decisions are right, superior skill can increase the &lt;br /&gt;expected benefit from concentration and leverage.  But that kind of superior skill by &lt;br /&gt;definition is rare and elusive. . . . &lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should&lt;br /&gt; superior profits be available to the novice, the untutored or the lazy?  &lt;br /&gt;Why should people be able to make above average returns without hard work and above &lt;br /&gt;average skill, and without knowing something most others don’t know?  And yet many &lt;br /&gt;individuals invest based on the belief that they can.  (If they didn’t believe that, wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;they index or, at a minimum, turn over the task to others?)   &lt;br /&gt;No, the solut&lt;br /&gt;ion can’t lie in rigid tactics, publicly available formulas or loss-eliminating &lt;br /&gt;rules . . . or in complete risk avoidance.  Superior investment results can only stem &lt;br /&gt;from a better-than-average ability to figure out when risk taking will lead to gain &lt;br /&gt;and when it will end in loss.  There is no alternative. &lt;br /&gt;Superior &lt;br /&gt;skill is an essential ingredient if superior investment results are to be achieved reliably.  No &lt;br /&gt;tactic or technique will lead to superior results in the absence of superior judgment and &lt;br /&gt;implementation.  But by definition, only a small percentage of investors possess superior skill. &lt;br /&gt;It is mathematically irrefutable that (a) the average investor will produce before-fee performance in line &lt;br /&gt;with the market average and (b) active management fees will pull   the average investor’s return below the &lt;br /&gt;market average.  This has to be considered in light of the fact that average performance can generally be &lt;br /&gt;obtained through passive investing, with tiny fees and almost no risk of falling short. &lt;br /&gt;Superior inve&lt;br /&gt;stors and their well-thought-out approaches can produce superior returns on average in the &lt;br /&gt;long run.  But even they are far from perfect.  The best they can hope for is that they’ll be right more &lt;br /&gt;often than they’re wrong, and that their successful decisions will add more than their mistakes subtract. &lt;br /&gt;So, in the en&lt;br /&gt;d, there’s only one absolute truth about investing.  Charlie’s right: it isn’t easy.  &lt;br /&gt;September 9, 2015&lt;br /&gt;2015 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: On the Couch &lt;br /&gt;I woke up early on Saturday, December 12 – the morning after a day of significant declines in stocks, &lt;br /&gt;credit and crude oil – with enough thoughts going through my mind to keep me from going back to sleep.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus I moved to my desk to start a memo that would pull them together.  I knew it might be a long time &lt;br /&gt;between inception and eventual issuance, since every time I dealt with one thought, two more popped into &lt;br /&gt;my head.  In the end, it took a month to get it done.  &lt;br /&gt;Professor Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago is a leading expert on behavioral economics and &lt;br /&gt;decision-making (in fact, he’s such a significant figure in the field that he was given a cameo role in the &lt;br /&gt;movie The Big Short).  He opens his new book, Misbehaving, with Vilfredo Pareto’s assertion that “the &lt;br /&gt;foundation of political economy and, in general, of every social science, is evidently psychology.”  I’d &lt;br /&gt;apply that equally to the not-so-scientific field of investing. &lt;br /&gt;It has been one of my constant refrains – dating back all the way to “Random Thoughts on the &lt;br /&gt;Identification of Investment Opportunities” (January 1994) –&lt;br /&gt; that in order to be successful, an investor &lt;br /&gt;has to understand not just finance, accounting and economics, but also psychology.  A thorough &lt;br /&gt;understanding of how investors’ minds work is essential if one is to figure out where a market is in its &lt;br /&gt;cycle, why, and what to do about it.  For me, the markets’ recent behavior – certainly on December 11, &lt;br /&gt;but also at other &lt;br /&gt;points in 2015 – reinforces that observation.   &lt;br /&gt;This memo is my attempt to send the markets to the psychiatrist’s couch, and an exploration of what &lt;br /&gt;might be learned there. &lt;br /&gt;2012-14: An Uncertain World &lt;br /&gt;In September 2012, I wrote a memo called “On Uncertain Ground.”  To begin it, I observed that “The &lt;br /&gt;world seems more uncertain today than at any other time in my life.”  I went on to list the things that &lt;br /&gt;worried me.  Few of them are less troubling today.  Certainly the period of the post-crisis recovery hasn’t &lt;br /&gt;been carefree.  Here are the things that concerned me in 2012, as viewed from that perspective:   &lt;br /&gt;Macro growth – It seems to be broadly accepted that overall economic growth will be slower in&lt;br /&gt;the years ahead than in the latter part of the twentieth century.  Do lower birth rates and slowing&lt;br /&gt;gains in productivity doom us to reduced macro gains?  What does this mean for everything else?&lt;br /&gt;In particular, if growth remains slow, will it lead to slowing inflation, or even deflation?&lt;br /&gt;Trends in the developed world – Will the developed nations be able to compete in a globalized&lt;br /&gt;economy?  How will incomes hold up as developing nations produce goods cheaper, and as the&lt;br /&gt;quality of those goods improves?  As we increasingly become knowledge-based economies, will&lt;br /&gt;we need as many less-educated workers as in the past?  If not, what will be the ramifications for&lt;br /&gt;unemployment, income inequality and society as a whole?&lt;br /&gt;Consumer behavior –&lt;br /&gt; Will consumers regain the confidence required to return to their expansive&lt;br /&gt;spending behavior?  Will they employ credit as in the past to perpetuate growth in consumption?&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe – Will Europe move forward in terms of cohesion, coordination and productivity?  What&lt;br /&gt;happens if it doesn’t?  Will the ECB be able to engineer an economic recovery?  Will the&lt;br /&gt;departure from the European Union of Greece –&lt;br /&gt; or new Greeces – return as a worry in the future?&lt;br /&gt;(And now, will the coming referendum mandate Great Britain’s departure?  Will there be a new&lt;br /&gt;referendum in Scotland with regard to remaining in the UK?  Will Catalonia vote to leave Spain,&lt;br /&gt;and what will that mean for its membership in the EU?)&lt;br /&gt;Leadership – For years I gave speeches using PowerPoint slides listing sources of uncertainty,&lt;br /&gt;but where it was supposed to say “dearth of leadership,” someone had mistakenly typed “death of&lt;br /&gt;leadership” . . . and nobody quibbled.  Throughout the world, few countries if any have leaders on&lt;br /&gt;par with history’s best.  Certainly that’s true in the U.S.  You may think it’s a good thing, or you&lt;br /&gt;may not, but it’s clear that Washington is too gridlocked to accomplish much.  As I wrote in “On&lt;br /&gt;Uncertain Ground,”  “. . &lt;br /&gt;. U.S. politicians seem to value things like ‘ideological purity’ (i.e.,&lt;br /&gt;toeing the party line) and being reelected above real attempts at problem solving.  Partisanship&lt;br /&gt;and open warfare has surely reached a new zenith.”&lt;br /&gt;Entitlements &lt;br /&gt;– Social Security is a locomotive rumbling down the track to ruin.  The cost of&lt;br /&gt;health care programs is growing rapidly, as drugs become more expensive and Americans live&lt;br /&gt;longer.  Defined-benefit pensions have been promised to public employees but not fully funded.&lt;br /&gt;How will federal, state and city governments meet their obligations?  Not only does no one know,&lt;br /&gt;but also few people in government (certainly not in Washington) seem to care.&lt;br /&gt;China –&lt;br /&gt; As the world’s second-largest economy, China plays a very important role in&lt;br /&gt;determining global growth.  Its GDP advanced at double-digit rates over the last 20+ years –&lt;br /&gt;without rece&lt;br /&gt;ssions – on the basis of (a) millions of people moving from farms to cities (and to&lt;br /&gt;more productive roles in manufacturing), (b) the low-cost exports they produced and (c) readily&lt;br /&gt;available capital and the heavy fixed-asset investment it permitted.  Henceforth China will gain&lt;br /&gt;less from the above and will have to transition to domestic consumption of goods and services, as&lt;br /&gt;well as a slower-growing economy . . . perhaps with ups and downs like the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Will this &lt;br /&gt;result in a near-term hard landing?  And what will be the impact on nations that sell&lt;br /&gt;commodities and finished goods to China?&lt;br /&gt;Geopolitical hotspots – From the fall of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 until the 9/11&lt;br /&gt;attacks in 2001, investors’ positive &lt;br /&gt;feelings were abetted by the presence of peace in the world.&lt;br /&gt;But in recent years we have faced challenges involving Iran, Israel and the rest of the Middle&lt;br /&gt;East; Russia and Ukraine; China and North Korea; and terrorist threats in many places.  How will&lt;br /&gt;markets react to the inevitable flare-ups?&lt;br /&gt;The worries listed above confronted investors throughout the period 2012 through 2014.  And in the last &lt;br /&gt;few months of that period, we saw a halving of the price of oil; additional slowing in China; worsening &lt;br /&gt;news from the Middle East; and continuing uncertainty regarding the Fed’s likely action on interest rates.  &lt;br /&gt;Given markets’ abhorrence of uncertainty, we normally would expect such issues to result in low asset &lt;br /&gt;prices and negative returns.  But in 2012-14, despite the many negatives, we saw a cumulative return of &lt;br /&gt;74% on the S&amp;P 500, as well as strong appreciation on the part of real estate and companies that had been &lt;br /&gt;the subject of buyouts.  Further reflecting investor confidence, the yield spread versus Treasurys for the &lt;br /&gt;average U.S. high yield bond narrowed from 706 basis points at the end of 2011 to 522 b.p. at the end of &lt;br /&gt;2014, at which point the prospective yield to worst was down to 6.67%.  Thus, as 2014 moved to a close, &lt;br /&gt;we saw: &lt;br /&gt;the litany of meaningful macro risks described above,&lt;br /&gt;investors engaging in pro-risk behavior in pursuit of adequate returns in a low-return world,&lt;br /&gt;as a consequence, full asset prices, and thus&lt;br /&gt;little likelihood of achieving returns high enough to compensate for the risks.&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, psychology (and thus prices) were high given the fundamentals.  Our world was marked by &lt;br /&gt;low prospective returns and plentiful problems, a troubling combination. &lt;br /&gt;Here’s what I wrote in “Risk Revisited” in September 2014: &lt;br /&gt;While investor behavior hasn’t sunk to the depths seen just before the crisis (and, in my &lt;br /&gt;opinion, that contributed greatly to it), in many ways it has entered the zone of &lt;br /&gt;imprudence. . . . &lt;br /&gt;It’s the job of investors to strike a proper balance between offense and defense, and &lt;br /&gt;between worrying about losing money and worrying about missing opportunity.  Today I &lt;br /&gt;feel it’s important to pay more attention to loss prevention than to the pursuit of gain.  For &lt;br /&gt;the last three years Oaktree’s mantra has been “move forward, but with caution.”  At this &lt;br /&gt;time, in reiterating that mantra, I would increase the emphasis on those last three words: &lt;br /&gt;“but with caution”. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;Although I have no idea what could make the day of reckoning come sooner rather than &lt;br /&gt;later, I don’t think it’s too early to take today’s carefree market conditions into &lt;br /&gt;consideration.  What I do know is that those conditions are creating a degree of risk for &lt;br /&gt;which there is no commensurate risk premium.  &lt;br /&gt;The Negatives Build &lt;br /&gt;Given the many concerns, performance in the first half of 2015 was sluggish at best.  Most markets eked &lt;br /&gt;out positive returns, but gains came grudgingly, and few investors had a good time.  Then, during the &lt;br /&gt;summer, the accumulation of worries accelerated and became too much to withstand: &lt;br /&gt;Growth remained flat or slowed in the U.S., Europe and Japan.&lt;br /&gt;China’s economy continued to slow.&lt;br /&gt;The Fed continued to dither regarding interest rates.  A potential increase caused worry, but so&lt;br /&gt;did the appearan&lt;br /&gt;ce that the Fed considered growth too weak to allow an increase.&lt;br /&gt;The oil price decline resumed, and other metals and commodities joined in, weakening the prices&lt;br /&gt;of related stocks and bonds.&lt;br /&gt;The geopolitical picture went from bad to worse:&lt;br /&gt;oSyria presented a choice between (a) enabling a despot to remain and (b) ousting him and&lt;br /&gt;turning over another country to instability and insurgency.&lt;br /&gt;oRussia intervened, flexing its muscles and reminding us of its intransigence.&lt;br /&gt;oISIS and the flow of immigrants to Europe took on the appearance of insoluble problems;&lt;br /&gt;Paris and San Bernardino showed terrorism to be a serious ongoing threat.&lt;br /&gt;oAn agreement was reached to limit Iran’s nuclear progress, but no two experts seemed to&lt;br /&gt;agree on whether it was a good or bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;oIraq, Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine got no better.&lt;br /&gt;oThe South China Sea heated up from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing positive to say about the U.S. political situation.  Partisanship and gridlock&lt;br /&gt;remained the rule.  The grinding two-year campaign took up increased airtime and mindshare,&lt;br /&gt;without a positive consensus concerning most candidates.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a number of issues internal to the markets – ranging from reduced liquidity to market-&lt;br /&gt;reporting g&lt;br /&gt;litches to the meltdown of high-risk credit funds – shook investors’ faith.&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, market participants are able to live with uncertainties like these and retain their equanimity, &lt;br /&gt;sometimes for long periods.  Maybe it’s conviction, maybe it’s obliviousness, and maybe it’s denial.  &lt;br /&gt;And that’s what prevailed in recent times; as Doug Kass put it in mid-2014, we’ve been experiencing “a &lt;br /&gt;bul&lt;br /&gt;l market in complacency.”   &lt;br /&gt;But eventually&lt;br /&gt; something else happens – perhaps the house of cards grows too high – and investors’ &lt;br /&gt;feeling&lt;br /&gt; of serenity is pierced.  A point is reached beyond which equanimity can no longer be maintained.  &lt;br /&gt;It was getting to that point that led to meaningful declines in U.S. credit markets in the latter half of 2015. &lt;br /&gt;The Tipping Point &lt;br /&gt;One of the most notable behavioral traits among investors is their tendency to overlook negatives or &lt;br /&gt;understate their significance for a while, and then eventually to capitulate and overreact to them on &lt;br /&gt;the downside.  I attribute a lot of this to psychological failings and the rest to the inability to appreciate &lt;br /&gt;the true significance of events.   &lt;br /&gt;As negatives accumulate – whether they surface for the first time or just are finally recognized as &lt;br /&gt;significant – eventually a time comes when they can no longer be ignored, and instead they come to be &lt;br /&gt;treate&lt;br /&gt;d as being of overwhelming importance.  The latest tipping point was reached last August. &lt;br /&gt;Up to that point, investors had pretty much resisted the negatives, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.3% in the &lt;br /&gt;first seven months of the year.  (The media might say investors had “coped with” the negatives, but of &lt;br /&gt;course they hadn’t dealt with them; they’d ignored them.)   &lt;br /&gt;But then, in August, a series of negatives occurred in China: reports of still more economic slowing; a &lt;br /&gt;decline in A-share prices from June to August that reached 45%; an unexpected devaluation of the &lt;br /&gt;renminbi (whose value many people complained for years had been artificially depressed); and market-&lt;br /&gt;support m&lt;br /&gt;easures that some found ham-handed (e.g., restrictions on actions such as short selling, and &lt;br /&gt;investigations of journalists writing negative articles about the stock market). &lt;br /&gt;“Everyone knew” for years that the Chinese economy had been overstimulated with cheap &lt;br /&gt;financing, and that this had led to excessive investment in fixed assets.  The effect was exceptional &lt;br /&gt;GDP growth, but also a large stock of unneeded buildings and infrastructure.  Everyone also knew that a &lt;br /&gt;hard landing – a painful slowing in economic growth, and perhaps a recession – was among the possible &lt;br /&gt;outcom&lt;br /&gt;es.  But it wasn’t until August that investors outside China began to notice A-shares’ &lt;br /&gt;collapse; consider the possibility that a slowdown in China could have negative ramifications for &lt;br /&gt;the rest of the world; and import those worries to their own markets.  Thus between August 17 and &lt;br /&gt;25, the S&amp;P 500 declined 11%.  What was behind the extrapolation of China’s woes to other markets, like &lt;br /&gt;ours?  Here’s how I explained it in “It’s Not Easy,” published in September on the heels of the events in &lt;br /&gt;Chi&lt;br /&gt;na: &lt;br /&gt;Especially during downdrafts, many investors impute intelligence to the market and look &lt;br /&gt;to it to tell them what’s going on and what to do about it.  This is one of the biggest &lt;br /&gt;mistakes you can make.  As Ben Graham pointed out, the day-to-day market isn’t a &lt;br /&gt;fundamental analyst; it’s a barometer of investor sentiment.  You just can’t take it &lt;br /&gt;too seriously.  Market participants have limited insight into what’s really happening in &lt;br /&gt;terms of fundamentals, and any intelligence that could be behind their buys and sells is &lt;br /&gt;obscured by their emotional swings.  It would be wrong to interpret the recent worldwide &lt;br /&gt;drop as meaning the market “knows” tough times lay ahead.  Rather, China came out &lt;br /&gt;with some negative news and people panicked, especially Chinese investors who had &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bought stocks on margin and perhaps were experiencing their first serious market &lt;br /&gt;correction.  Their selling prompted investors in the U.S. and elsewhere to sell also, &lt;br /&gt;believing that the market decline in China signaled serious implications for the Chinese &lt;br /&gt;economy and others.  &lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, the bottom line for me is that whereas risk tolerance had ruled through July, &lt;br /&gt;risk aversion was reawakened in August.  I picture an investor who’s oblivious to risk in the earlier &lt;br /&gt;months and then suddenly says, “Oh yeah: there are things to worry about.”  The tipping point finally &lt;br /&gt;arrives, a sudden wake-up call to the existence and importance of risk. &lt;br /&gt;Half-Full or Half-Empty? &lt;br /&gt;Almost 25 years ago, in my second memo (“First Quarter Performance,” April 1991), I introduced the &lt;br /&gt;concept of the investment pendulum:  &lt;br /&gt;Although the midpoint of its arc best describes the location of the pendulum “on &lt;br /&gt;average,” it actually spends very little of its time there.  Instead, it is almost always &lt;br /&gt;swinging toward or away from the extremes of its arc.  But whenever the pendulum is &lt;br /&gt;near either extreme, it is inevitable that it will move back toward the midpoint sooner or &lt;br /&gt;later. &lt;br /&gt;One of the most significant factors keeping investors from reaching appropriate conclusions is their &lt;br /&gt;tendency to assess the world with emotionalism rather than objectivity.  Their failings take two &lt;br /&gt;primary forms: selective perception and skewed interpretation.  In other words, sometimes they take &lt;br /&gt;note of only positive events and ignore the negative ones, and sometimes the opposite is true.  And &lt;br /&gt;sometimes they view events in a positive light, and sometimes it’s negative.  But rarely are their &lt;br /&gt;perceptions and interpretations balanced and neutral. &lt;br /&gt;Ever since the August events in China, I’ve repeatedly found myself harking back to one of the oldest &lt;br /&gt;cartoons in my file, and still one of the very best: &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 we saw old problems get worse, new ones arise, and a general absence of anything to feel good &lt;br /&gt;about.  The sense of hopelessness regarding problems like ISIS and runaway immigration is something &lt;br /&gt;investors handle particularly poorly.  In August, the events in China sparked a revival of risk aversion and &lt;br /&gt;fear, with effects that carried around the world for a couple of weeks.  And with the door opened to &lt;br /&gt;fearful interpretation, Pollyanna tolerance gave way to widespread negativism.   &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that investor psychology rarely gives equal weight to both favorable and &lt;br /&gt;unfavorable developments.  Likewise, investors’ interpretation of events is usually biased by their &lt;br /&gt;emotional reaction to whatever is going on at the moment.  Most developments have both helpful and &lt;br /&gt;harmful aspects.  But investors generally obsess about one or the other rather than consider both.  And &lt;br /&gt;that recalls another classic cartoon: &lt;br /&gt;It all seems so obvious: investors rarely maintain objective, rational, neutral and stable positions.  First &lt;br /&gt;they exhibit high levels of optimism, greed, risk tolerance and credulousness, and their resulting &lt;br /&gt;behavior causes asset prices to rise, potential returns to fall and risk to increase.  But then, for some &lt;br /&gt;reason – perhaps the arrival of a tipping point – they switch to pessimism, fear, risk aversion and &lt;br /&gt;skepticism, and this causes asset prices to fall, prospective returns to rise and risk to decrease.  &lt;br /&gt;Notably, each group of phenomena tends to happen in unison, and the swing from one to the other often &lt;br /&gt;goes far beyond what reason might call for. &lt;br /&gt;That’s one of the cr&lt;br /&gt;azy things: in the real world, things generally fluctuate between “pretty good” &lt;br /&gt;and “not so hot.”  But in the world of investing, perception often swings from “flawless” to &lt;br /&gt;“hopeless.”  The pendulum careens from one extreme to the other, spending almost no time at “the happy &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;medium” and rather little in the range of reasonableness.  First there’s denial, and then there’s &lt;br /&gt;capitulation.   &lt;br /&gt;The Sources of Error &lt;br /&gt;To explain why these bipolar episodes occur, I want to spend a little time on some of the factors behind &lt;br /&gt;investor psychology.  For the most part they’re easily observed and dissected, and not mysterious.  I &lt;br /&gt;discussed some of them in “It’s Not Easy”: &lt;br /&gt;Emotion is one of the investor’s greatest enemies.  Fear makes it hard to remain &lt;br /&gt;optimistic about holdings whose prices are plummeting, just as envy makes it hard to &lt;br /&gt;refrain from buying the appreciating assets that everyone else is enjoying owning.   &lt;br /&gt;Confidence is one of the key emotions, and I attribute a lot of the market’s recent &lt;br /&gt;volatility to a swing from too much of it a short while ago to too little more recently.  The &lt;br /&gt;swing may [result] from disillusionment: it’s particularly painful when investors &lt;br /&gt;recognize that they know far less than they had thought about how the world works.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s important to remain moderate as to confidence, but instead it’s usually the case that &lt;br /&gt;confidence –&lt;br /&gt; like other emotions – swings radically. &lt;br /&gt;While China was the “proximate cause” of the recent volatility, other things often &lt;br /&gt;contribute, and last month was no exception.  The word that always comes to mind for &lt;br /&gt;me is “confluence.”  Investors can usually keep their heads in the face of one &lt;br /&gt;negative.  But when they face more than one simultaneously, they often lose their &lt;br /&gt;cool.  One additional negative last month was the glitch in Bank of New York Mellon’s &lt;br /&gt;SunGard software, and the bank’s consequent inability to price 1,200 mutual funds and &lt;br /&gt;ETFs that it administers.  It was another dose of disillusionment: no one enjoys learning &lt;br /&gt;that the market mechanisms they need to work can’t be depended on. &lt;br /&gt;Another area of error – be it the result of flawed perception or inadequate insight and analysis – &lt;br /&gt;can be seen in investors’ repeated failure to understand the potential for ramifications and second-&lt;br /&gt;order consequences.  One instance was the general lack of concern about contagion from sub-prime &lt;br /&gt;mortgage backed securities that prevailed between early 2007 – when mortgages began to default in large &lt;br /&gt;numbers – and the t&lt;br /&gt;umultuous events of mid/late 2008.  Most people overlooked the potential for &lt;br /&gt;contagion, and thus (for example), as of May 2008 the S&amp;P 500 was essentially unchanged from the first &lt;br /&gt;quarter of 2007.  Yet sub-prime mortgage defaults contributed significantly to the subsequent bank &lt;br /&gt;collapses and bailouts, the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, and the late-2008 emergence of fear of &lt;br /&gt;a financial system meltdown.  As a consequence, between May 2008 and March 2009 the S&amp;P lost 52%.  &lt;br /&gt;The events that produced such extreme distress in late 2008 and early 2009 were unforeseen and &lt;br /&gt;unimagi&lt;br /&gt;ned just a few months before . . . even though the clues had been there for a year. &lt;br /&gt;There are many&lt;br /&gt; more ways in which non-objective, non-rational quirks commonly affect behavior.  As &lt;br /&gt;Carol Tavris points out in her May 15, 2015 Wall Street Journal review of Professor Thaler’s book: &lt;br /&gt;As a social psychologist, I have long been amused by economists and their curiously &lt;br /&gt;delusional notion of the “rational man.”  Rational?  Where do these folks live?  Even 50 &lt;br /&gt;years ago, experimental studies were demonstrating that people stay with clearly wrong &lt;br /&gt;decisions rather than change them, throw good money after bad, justify failed predictions &lt;br /&gt;rather than admit they were wrong, and resist, distort or actively reject information that &lt;br /&gt;disputes their beliefs. &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of understanding events, their significance and their potential ramifications comes in &lt;br /&gt;good part from the kinks in investors’ psyches, and it contributes to – and feeds back to exacerbate &lt;br /&gt;– investors’ responses.  Thus investor&lt;br /&gt;s tend to emphasize just the positives or the negatives much more&lt;br /&gt;often than they take a balanced, objective approach.  And they tend to become optimistic and eager to buy&lt;br /&gt;when good news, positively interpreted, has forced prices up . . . and vice versa.  All of this is obvious&lt;br /&gt;(especially in retrospect), and thus equally obviously, understanding and dealing with it presents a&lt;br /&gt;potential way to improve results.&lt;br /&gt;Notions of market efficiency – the idea that most assets are priced “right” – are based on belief in &lt;br /&gt;investor rationality and objectivity.  But certainly those traits are little seen in real life.  &lt;br /&gt;“Inefficiencies” – in everyday language, “mispricings” – stem from biases against one asset or in favor of &lt;br /&gt;another: legal, cultural, informational, and especially behavioral and emotional.  The first three of these &lt;br /&gt;exist much less nowadays than they did 30 or 40 years ago, but the latter two still rear their head from &lt;br /&gt;time to time.  And I’m sure they always will.  &lt;br /&gt;Case In Point – Oil &lt;br /&gt;On December 12, as I began to write this memo, the Financial Times provided several examples of the &lt;br /&gt;negative thinking being applied.  Here are some excerpts from an article about the recent market action: &lt;br /&gt;Oil prices fell sharply to a seven-year low, rattling stock markets at the end of a choppy &lt;br /&gt;week. . . .  The price of Brent crude, the global energy benchmark, was down 5.6% to &lt;br /&gt;$37.49 . . .  after Opec at its meeting a week ago failed to agree output cuts, leaving &lt;br /&gt;prices at the mercy of a global glut. &lt;br /&gt;“Lower oil pri&lt;br /&gt;ces are here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;” &lt;br /&gt;The CBOE Oil Vix is holding above the 54 level . . . as investors pay up to protect &lt;br /&gt;themselves [against], or speculate upon, further sharp moves in crude.  &lt;br /&gt;That all sounds very serious.  But is it?  Does it make any sense?  What’s the real significance of &lt;br /&gt;declining oil prices? &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that, if you aren’t an oil company or a net oil-producing country, low oil prices &lt;br /&gt;aren’t necessarily a bad thing.  For net oil importers like the U.S., Europe, Japan and China, the drop &lt;br /&gt;we’ve seen in the price of oil is analogous to a multi-hundred-billion-dollar tax cut, adding to consumers’ &lt;br /&gt;disposable income.  It can also increase an importer nation’s cost-competitiveness. &lt;br /&gt;The U.S. is both a produc&lt;br /&gt;er of oil and an importer.  That means the macro economy will enjoy the benefit &lt;br /&gt;of cost reduction and income enhancement, but domestic oil companies and those who provide them with &lt;br /&gt;products and services will gain less from production than had been expected, and some state and local &lt;br /&gt;governments will be hard-hit.  (And I must add that, thus far, the indicators fail to suggest a salutary &lt;br /&gt;impact on the broad economy.)  Eighteen months ago I thought the ability to produce oil through fracking &lt;br /&gt;at a cost of $40-60 per barrel would give the U.S. a cost advantage in manufacturing; that’s no longer &lt;br /&gt;likely, at least for now.   &lt;br /&gt;But the one th&lt;br /&gt;ing that’s beyond doubt is that the impact of the fall in the price of oil is far from all bad.  In &lt;br /&gt;fact, I’d say that it’s positive on balance for the U.S. and an unmitigated boon for t&lt;br /&gt;he UK, Europe and &lt;br /&gt;East Asia.  So why did the FT attribute market weakness to it?  First, the media have taken on the &lt;br /&gt;unpleasan&lt;br /&gt;t task of telling us why the markets went up or down each day, and the falling oil price is an &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;easy answer . . . until you give it any real thought.  Second, though, as the FT went on to explain, some &lt;br /&gt;worry might be appropriate regarding what it connotes: &lt;br /&gt;The fall in commodity prices is causing market anxiety because investors are worried that &lt;br /&gt;it signals a slowdown in global demand, and that any economic benefit from cheaper &lt;br /&gt;costs for consumers and businesses is being counteracted by the cutting of investments &lt;br /&gt;and jobs by the resources sector.  &lt;br /&gt;In other words, they’re inferring that the price of oil declined because demand is off, and that this signals &lt;br /&gt;economic weakness.  But economic growth is what it is; we don’t need the oil price to tell us it’s weak.  &lt;br /&gt;And the price of oil is off another third in the last few months, even though world GDP is still growing. &lt;br /&gt;The important thing isn’t what the oil price decline tells us about today.  It’s what it says about tomorrow.  &lt;br /&gt;And to me, everything else being equal, I think low energy prices today will contribute to better economic &lt;br /&gt;growth tomorrow.  (Low prices today probably also imply higher prices eventually, through their impact &lt;br /&gt;on supply and demand.)  It’s just that everybody’s interpreting everything negatively these days. &lt;br /&gt;Case In Point – Interest Rates &lt;br /&gt;The FT also pointed out that investors were reacting to the likelihood the Fed would raise interest rates, &lt;br /&gt;even though that should have been a foregone conclusion: &lt;br /&gt;Next week, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.  That at least now appears likely.  &lt;br /&gt;Anything else would be the biggest shock of a year in which markets and monetary &lt;br /&gt;authorities have had serious misgivings.  Let us assume for now that it happens. &lt;br /&gt;This will be the longest-awaited and most-previewed tightening of monetary policy in &lt;br /&gt;history. &lt;br /&gt;There’s something wrong if an event that has been widely anticipated for years – and considered a &lt;br /&gt;near certainty for months – can be thought capable of significantly impacting the market when it &lt;br /&gt;becomes a fact.  People’s expectations should be incorporated into the prices they assign to assets.  So a &lt;br /&gt;negative reaction to the imminence of a widely heralded interest-rate increase must imply that either (a) &lt;br /&gt;investors ar&lt;br /&gt;e too dense to have incorporated it into prices before this, (b) the increase will be a bigger deal &lt;br /&gt;than people thought, or (c) the market is irrational. &lt;br /&gt;On December 15, Dow J&lt;br /&gt;ones published the following quote: &lt;br /&gt;“It’s been more shoot f&lt;br /&gt;irst, ask questions later” in the shares of large asset managers, said &lt;br /&gt;Kenneth Hill, an analyst at Barclays PLC. “The concern is largely that as rates move &lt;br /&gt;higher, investors think returns will move lower and there will be some rotation out of &lt;br /&gt;fixed income.  People are anxious to see how that plays out,” he added. &lt;br /&gt;When Mr. Hill said that, more than two and a half years had passed since May 2013, when Ben Bernanke &lt;br /&gt;foreshadowed a “tapering” of bond purchases and the possibility of higher interest rates.  How can &lt;br /&gt;investors not have had enough time to adjust to the possibility of higher rates and incorporate it into asset &lt;br /&gt;prices?  Indeed, the increase that was just days away should have been mostly a non-event, and the idea &lt;br /&gt;that it was a significant contributor to the declines on December 11 makes no &lt;br /&gt;apparent sense. &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years since Bernanke’s statement in 2013, the question I’ve been asked more often than any &lt;br /&gt;other has been, “What month will the Fed begin to raise interest rates?”  My response has been consistent: &lt;br /&gt;“I have no idea, and why do you care?”  If someone tells me he’ll do one thing if he thinks the Fed’s &lt;br /&gt;going to raise rates in March and something different if it’s going to happen in January, what he’s &lt;br /&gt;demonstrated is that he doesn’t understand how asset prices incorporate expectations.  The difference in &lt;br /&gt;timing should have little effect on the choice of a course of action.  What matters is how far rates will go, &lt;br /&gt;and how fast.  I don’t expect much of either from this dovish and cautious Fed . . . unless the economy &lt;br /&gt;surprises on the upside.  And that would be good news, wouldn’t it? &lt;br /&gt;While on the subject of interest rates, I want to mention the thing about them that most annoys me these &lt;br /&gt;days.  People who acted one way when rates were unchanged (even though everyone knew they wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;remain that way for long) are acting very differently now that there’s been a quarter-point increase.  This, &lt;br /&gt;they say, is&lt;br /&gt; because “we’re in a rising-rate environment.”  But the issue of interest rates, like most others, &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t be viewed as binary . . . black or white . . . flat rates or rising.  The essential questions are, &lt;br /&gt;“how much will rates rise?” and “when the series of increases is over, will rates be high enough to &lt;br /&gt;meaningfully alter behavior?”  That’s what counts. &lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal wrote as follows: “Analysts and investors attribute the [auto stocks’ &lt;br /&gt;recent greater-than-market] declines to worries that rising U.S. interest rates could crimp auto finance and &lt;br /&gt;to fears that&lt;br /&gt; auto sales may have peaked.”   Does the interest rate outlook really mean significantly fewer &lt;br /&gt;cars will be sold . . . especially given that low gas prices are making consumers richer and driving &lt;br /&gt;cheaper?  I think people may have jumped to an unwarranted – and negatively tinged – conclusion. &lt;br /&gt;Case In Point – Third Avenue &lt;br /&gt;In terms of investor reaction, I find the announcement that Third Avenue’s Focused Credit Fund would &lt;br /&gt;liquidate to be the most interesting recent event.  According to the FT: &lt;br /&gt;The liquidation of the biggest US mutual fund since 2008 has intensified concern for the &lt;br /&gt;health of the US corporate bond market. &lt;br /&gt;Some distinguished between a risk to the system, where issues at one fund trigger &lt;br /&gt;redemptions from others, and so-called idiosyncratic problems related to a single fund. &lt;br /&gt;Corporate bonds sold off again yesterday in the wake of the FCF liquidation  &lt;br /&gt;announcement and many investors rushed to buy default insurance contracts on junk debt. &lt;br /&gt;There isn’t much to be in doubt about in the meltdown of the Focused Credit Fund; clearly it reflected &lt;br /&gt;problems peculiar to that fund alone.  In 2014, while a $3½ billion fund, it had substantial holdings in &lt;br /&gt;particularly-high-risk, illiquid debt.  Then it encountered snowballing capital withdrawals at a time of &lt;br /&gt;reduced market liquidity.  Under circumstances like these, portfolio managers generally raise cash by &lt;br /&gt;liquidating their most salable holdings, causing the quality and liquidity of the remaining portfolio to &lt;br /&gt;decline.  Continuing withdrawals took FCF’s assets below $800 million in December 2015, and I hear it &lt;br /&gt;was dow&lt;br /&gt;n to 20 or fewer holdings, all of extremely low quality.  Further redemptions would have forced &lt;br /&gt;the manager to sell those, realizing extremely low prices, eliminating any liquidity that may have been &lt;br /&gt;present, and leaving investors who hadn’t redeemed holding the bag. &lt;br /&gt;The fault ce&lt;br /&gt;rtainly lies with the fund’s managers.  Risky, illiquid investments may be appropriate for &lt;br /&gt;closed-end funds whose capital is secure, but probably not for mutual funds or other vehicles subject to &lt;br /&gt;daily redemptions.  It’s debatable whether a fund should be expected to be able &lt;br /&gt;to handle both an 80% &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;loss of AUM and a substantial decline in liquidity.  But, as I wrote in “Liquidity” (March 2015), “no &lt;br /&gt;investor should shoulder more illiquidity than its realities permit” and, in particular, “no investment &lt;br /&gt;vehicle should promise more liquidity than is afforded by its underlying assets.”  Illiquid assets and the &lt;br /&gt;possibility of capital flight: there are few surer recipes for investment disaster. &lt;br /&gt;Investors lacking strong emotional and analytical foundations might have been scared into believing that &lt;br /&gt;FCF’s problems connoted – or presaged – widespread weakness among high yield bonds and other forms &lt;br /&gt;of risky debt.  Those who were a bit less panicky might have understood that high yield bonds in general &lt;br /&gt;were probably secure but still feared that illiquidity would combine with cascading redemptions to cause &lt;br /&gt;a chain reaction of capital withdrawals from other funds, forced sales, and collapsing bond prices.  But &lt;br /&gt;those with adequate emotional and analytical resources would have recognized that FCF’s problems were &lt;br /&gt;more endogenous and idiosyncratic than a function of high yield bonds broadly, and that adequate &lt;br /&gt;creditworthiness provides the debtholder’s u&lt;br /&gt;ltimate protection against chaos in the market. &lt;br /&gt;Recent Developments &lt;br /&gt;Behavioral economics and its younger cousin, behavioral investing, aren’t theoretical.  In fact, they’re the &lt;br /&gt;essence of practical: they’re &lt;br /&gt;about how human foibles cause real-life behavior to deviate from what &lt;br /&gt;theory might dictate.   &lt;br /&gt;In recent months we’ve had occasion to watch how mood swings can alter the investment environment.  &lt;br /&gt;I’ll describe below the events that have occurred in the market for distressed debt.   &lt;br /&gt;In the U.S., the years 2010-14 were characterized by gradual economic improvement, increasing &lt;br /&gt;corporate profits, a dramatic switch of the credit markets to accommodativeness, and – because of all this &lt;br /&gt;–some of&lt;br /&gt; the lowest default rates in history on low-grade debt.  As a result, there was a paucity of&lt;br /&gt;distressed debt.  Further, the little that was available was concentrated in just a few areas: European&lt;br /&gt;NPLs, real estate, shipping and power companies.  Put these factors together, and Oaktree found itself&lt;br /&gt;unable to assemble large or thoroughly diversified distressed debt portfolios.  Noting this, we followed up&lt;br /&gt;our record $10.9 billion fund raised in 2007-08 (and largely invested in the quarter following Lehman&lt;br /&gt;Brothers’ bankruptcy filing) with one of $5.5 billion in 2010 and then another of $2.7 billion in 2011.  In&lt;br /&gt;other words, we halved our investable capital and then halved it again.&lt;br /&gt;There is no immediate connection (other than for companies doing business there) between the slowdown &lt;br /&gt;in China or the price decline in the oil patch, on one hand, and the general creditworthiness and &lt;br /&gt;desirabil&lt;br /&gt;ity of high-risk debt on the other.  And yet, over the last few months, pronounced changes have &lt;br /&gt;occurred in the market for distressed debt: &lt;br /&gt;After a period of very stable prices – even for “iffy” debt – some securities have “gapped down”&lt;br /&gt;in the last few months (i.e., fallen several points at a time rather than correcting gradually).  In&lt;br /&gt;particular, investors have become highly intolerant of bad corporate news.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since 2008-09, the &lt;br /&gt;debt of some companies outside of energy and mining has&lt;br /&gt;fallen from 90 to 60, and others from 50 to 20.&lt;br /&gt;There is a general sense among my colleagues that investors have gone from evaluating&lt;br /&gt;securities based on the attractiveness of their yield (with company fundamentals viewed&lt;br /&gt;optimistically) to judging them on the basis of the likely recovery in a restructuring (with&lt;br /&gt;fundamentals viewed pessimistically).&lt;br /&gt;The capital markets have begun the swing from generous toward tight, as is their habit.  Thus,&lt;br /&gt;whereas they used to find it easy to refinance debt in order to extend maturities or secure “rescue&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;financing,” now it’s hard for companies – especially those experiencing any degree of difficulty – &lt;br /&gt;to obtain capital. &lt;br /&gt;On December 7, Oaktree held a dinner in New York for equity analysts who follow our publicly traded &lt;br /&gt;units.  Bob O’Leary, a co-portfolio manager of our distressed debt funds, planned to be among the hosts.  &lt;br /&gt;But he called me on December 3 with a question I hadn’t heard in a long time from my distressed debt &lt;br /&gt;colleagues: “Would you mind if I don’t come?  There’s too much going on for me to leave the office.”  &lt;br /&gt;The change in investor attitudes had created investment opportunities where they hadn’t existed just a few &lt;br /&gt;months before – in some cases out of proportion to the change in fundamentals. &lt;br /&gt;Developments like these are indicative of rising pessimism, skepticism and fear.  They’re largely what &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree hopes for, since – everything else being equal – they make for vastly improved buying &lt;br /&gt;opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;  But note that we may be just in the early stages of a downward spiral in corporate &lt;br /&gt;performance and credit market behavior.  Thus, while this may be “a time” to buy, I’m far from &lt;br /&gt;suggesting it’s “the time.” &lt;br /&gt;My Prescription &lt;br /&gt;To help investors deal with their potential for “human error,” this shrink would prescribe a number of &lt;br /&gt;elements that can help with the task: &lt;br /&gt;The first essential element in coping with markets’ irrationality is understanding.  The&lt;br /&gt;importance of psychology and its influence on markets must be recognized and dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;The second key lies in controlling one’s emotions.  An investor who is as subject as the crowd to&lt;br /&gt;emotional error is unlikely to do a superior job of surviving the markets’ swings.  Thus it is&lt;br /&gt;absolutely essential to keep optimism and fear in the appropriate balance.&lt;br /&gt;Emotional self-control isn’t enough.  It’s also important to have control over one’s&lt;br /&gt;circumstances.  For professionals, that primarily means structuring one’s environment so as to&lt;br /&gt;limit the impact on them of other people’s emotional swings.  Examples include inflows to and&lt;br /&gt;outflows from funds, fluctuations in market liquidity, and pressure for short-term performance.&lt;br /&gt;At Oaktree we never fail to appreciate the benefit we enjoy from being able to reject “hot money”&lt;br /&gt;and limit our funds’ redemption provisions.&lt;br /&gt;And finally there’s contrarianism, which can convert other investors’ emotional swings from a&lt;br /&gt;menace into a tool.  Going beyond just fending off emotional fluctuation, it’s highly desirable to&lt;br /&gt;become more optimistic when others become more fearful, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;I’m lucky to have received many gifts of investment insight early in my career.  Perhaps foremost among &lt;br /&gt;them is one I picked up in New York about 40 years ago, at a lunch meeting of what we called the Third &lt;br /&gt;Thursday Group.  It concerned the three stages of a bull market: &lt;br /&gt;the first, w&lt;br /&gt;hen only a few especially insightful people suspect improvement might occur,&lt;br /&gt;the second, when most people accept that improvement is actually taking place, and&lt;br /&gt;the third, when everyone concludes that things are sure to improve forever.&lt;br /&gt;Between the &lt;br /&gt;first stage and the last, nothing has to have changed in terms of fundamentals.  The &lt;br /&gt;difference lies in the perspective investors are bringing to their decisions.  But clearly, it’s great t&lt;br /&gt;o be &lt;br /&gt;a buyer in the first stage and essential not to be in the last.     &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know investors swing from rejecting all possibilities to drinking the Kool-Aid, just as the three stages &lt;br /&gt;say.  Thus at Oaktree we want to buy when they’re pessimistic, not when they’re eager participants.  If I &lt;br /&gt;could know only one thing about an investment I’m contemplating, it might be how much optimism &lt;br /&gt;is embodied in the price.  In the first stage of the bull market, no optimism is present, and that makes for &lt;br /&gt;great bargains.  In the last stage, the level of optimism is terribly high, and thus so are purchase prices &lt;br /&gt;relative to fundamentals.  I want to buy when I can benefit from the herd’s neuroses, not when they’ll &lt;br /&gt;penalize me just as they do everyone else.   &lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, since the middle of 2011 – by which time the quest for return had resulted in rather &lt;br /&gt;full prices for debt, over-generous capital markets and pro-risk investor behavior – Oaktree’s mantra has &lt;br /&gt;been “move forward, but with caution.”  We’ve felt it was right to invest in our markets, but also that our &lt;br /&gt;investments had to reflect a healthy dose of prudence.  Except for the occasional air pocket, investors &lt;br /&gt;didn’t suffer significant negative consequences prior to the last year or so.  Thus, as usual, we were early &lt;br /&gt;in tur&lt;br /&gt;ning cautious.  But opportunities (and returns) in the credit sphere have been only so-so since mid-&lt;br /&gt;2011, and I don’t think our caution caused us to miss much.   &lt;br /&gt;Now, as discussed above, investors’ optimism has deflated a bit, some negativity has come into the &lt;br /&gt;equation, and prices have moved lower.  Depending importantly on which market we’re talking &lt;br /&gt;about and how it has fared in recent months, we consider it appropriate to move forward with a &lt;br /&gt;little less caution. &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;While I have your attention, I want to devote a few paragraphs to the two questions I’m asked most &lt;br /&gt;often these days:  What are the implications for the U.S. and the rest of the world of China’s &lt;br /&gt;weakness, and are we moving toward a new crisis of the magnitude of what we saw in 2008? &lt;br /&gt;At a time when the environment is marked by so many potential problems, it’s important to figure out &lt;br /&gt;which if any are likely to present real problems.  Declining oil prices: the implications for non-oil &lt;br /&gt;producers seem mixed at worst.  A terrorist event: horrifying, but for any one person or location, I’d put it &lt;br /&gt;in the category of an “improbable disaster.”  The political picture: we’ll probably continue to muddle &lt;br /&gt;through no matter who’s elected. &lt;br /&gt;I would say tha&lt;br /&gt;t, of all the things on the list, the possibility of a hard landing in China is of the greatest &lt;br /&gt;significance when you combine magnitude, potential ramifications and the probability of it occurring.  So &lt;br /&gt;it’s important to look objectively at what it means for the U.S. &lt;br /&gt;First, let’s rem&lt;br /&gt;ember that China doesn’t play a pivotal role in the U.S. economy (other than as a provider &lt;br /&gt;of finished goods).  It is estimated to account for only 1% of the combined profits of the S&amp;P 500 &lt;br /&gt;companies.  Exports account for about 13% of U.S. GDP, and in the first eleven months of 2015 less than &lt;br /&gt;8% of our exported goods went to China ($106 billion of goods, versus an annual GDP approaching $18 &lt;br /&gt;trillion – again, well below 1%). &lt;br /&gt;Going on from there, I want to share Paul Krugman’s analysis from The New York Times of January 8.  (I &lt;br /&gt;generally don’t agree with Krugman’s politics, but I don’t think they’re relevant here.): &lt;br /&gt;Yes, China is a b&lt;br /&gt;ig economy, accounting in particular for about a quarter of world &lt;br /&gt;manufacturing, so what happens there has implications for all of us.  And China buys &lt;br /&gt;more than $2 trillion worth of goods and services from the rest of the world each year.  &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a big world, with a total gross domestic product excluding China of more than &lt;br /&gt;$60 trillion.  Even a drastic fall in Chinese imports would be only a modest hit to world &lt;br /&gt;spending. &lt;br /&gt;What about financial linkages?  One reason America’s subprime crisis turned global in &lt;br /&gt;2008 was that foreigners in general, and European banks in particular, turned out to be &lt;br /&gt;badly exposed to losses on U.S. securities.  But China has capital controls – that is, it &lt;br /&gt;isn’t very open to foreign investors – so there’s very little direct spillover from plunging &lt;br /&gt;stocks or even domestic debt defaults. &lt;br /&gt;All of this says that while China itself is in big trouble, the consequences for the rest of us &lt;br /&gt;should be manageable.  But I have to admit that I’m not as relaxed about this as the above &lt;br /&gt;analysis says I should be.  If you like, I lack the courage of my complacency.  Why? &lt;br /&gt;Part of the ans&lt;br /&gt;wer is that business cycles across nations often seem to be more &lt;br /&gt;synchronized than they “should” be.  For example, Europe and the United States export &lt;br /&gt;to each other only a small fraction of what they produce, yet they often have recessions &lt;br /&gt;and recoveries at the same time.  Financial linkages may be part of the story, but one also &lt;br /&gt;suspects that there is psychological contagion:  Good or bad news in one major economy &lt;br /&gt;affects animal spirits in others. &lt;br /&gt;So I worry that C&lt;br /&gt;hina may export its woes in ways back-of-the-envelope calculations &lt;br /&gt;miss . . . &lt;br /&gt;I want to highlight Krugman’s reference to “psychological contagion.”  It’s interesting in this regard that, &lt;br /&gt;last week, the world’s stock markets saw the following declines: S&amp;P 500 – 6.0%, FTSE 100 – 5.3%, &lt;br /&gt;DAX – 8.3% and&lt;br /&gt; Nikkei – 7.0%.  I consider it highly unlikely that such uniform declines were the &lt;br /&gt;result of independent, objective analysis of the impact of events on each economy and company.  &lt;br /&gt;Rather, I think they show the extent to which markets are linked by their investors’ shared &lt;br /&gt;psychology. &lt;br /&gt;So what about the likelihood of another 2008-style crash?  The bottom line for me is that a rerun of the &lt;br /&gt;Global Financial Crisis isn’t in the cards: &lt;br /&gt;We haven’t had a boom &lt;br /&gt;(either in the economy or in the stock market), so I don’t think&lt;br /&gt;we’&lt;br /&gt;re fated to have a bust.  Because most businesses have been particularly loath to&lt;br /&gt;expand their facilities, I don’t think they’ll be slammed if revenues flatten or turn down.&lt;br /&gt;The leverage in the private sector has been reduced.  This is particularly true of the banks,&lt;br /&gt;where leverage has gone from the region of 30+ times equity before the crisis to very low&lt;br /&gt;double digits today.  And, of course, banks are now barred from investing adventurously&lt;br /&gt;for their own account.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the main villain in the crisis was sub-prime mortgage backed securities.  The raw&lt;br /&gt;material – the underlying mortgages – was unsound and often fraudulent.  The structured&lt;br /&gt;mortgage vehicles were highly levered and absurdly highly rated.  And the risky tranches&lt;br /&gt;ended up in banks’ portfolios, causing them to require rescues.  Importantly, this time&lt;br /&gt;around I see no analog to sub-prime mortgages and MBS in terms of their&lt;br /&gt;combination of fragility and magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t mean to suggest&lt;br /&gt; there aren’t a lot of things to worry about: swollen centr&lt;br /&gt;al bank balance &lt;br /&gt;sheets; complete ignorance as to how they will be unwound and how interest rates will be moved higher; &lt;br /&gt;the seeming inability to generate economic growth and inflation; and the many other macro negatives &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listed earlier.  A hard landing and substantial devaluation in China, the world’s second largest economy, &lt;br /&gt;certainly could have far-reaching effects. &lt;br /&gt;It’s important that investors (as well as economists) avoid using words like “always,” “never,” “will,” &lt;br /&gt;“won’t,” “has to” and “can’t,” and I try to do just that.  But it’s my view that the GFC and its &lt;br /&gt;preconditions were highly unusual, and I don’t think we’re heading for an encore.  Remember, however, &lt;br /&gt;that I’m not a seer, and Oaktree and I never bet heavily on opinions regarding the future – mine or anyone &lt;br /&gt;else’s. &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;Before I close, I want&lt;br /&gt; to make it abundantly clear that when I call for caution in 2006-07, or active buying &lt;br /&gt;in late 2008, or renewed caution in 2012, or a somewhat more aggressive stance here in early 2016, I do it &lt;br /&gt;with considerable uncertainty.  My conclusions are the result of my reasoning, applied with the benefit of &lt;br /&gt;my experience (and collaboration with my Oaktree colleagues), but I never consider them 100% likely to &lt;br /&gt;be correct, or even 80%.  I think they’re right, of course, but I always make my recommendations &lt;br /&gt;with trepidation. &lt;br /&gt;I read the same newspapers as everyone else.  I see the same economic data.  I’m buffeted by the same &lt;br /&gt;market movements.  The same factors appeal to my emotions.  Maybe I’m a little more confident in my &lt;br /&gt;reasoning, and certainly I have more experience than most.  But the key is that – for whatever reason – &lt;br /&gt;I’m able to st&lt;br /&gt;and up to my emotions and follow my conclusions.  None of them can be documented or &lt;br /&gt;proved.  If they could be, most intelligent people would reach the same conclusions, with the same &lt;br /&gt;degree of confidence.  I tell you this only to communicate my feeling that no one should fear &lt;br /&gt;he’s not up &lt;br /&gt;to the task just because he’s unsure of his conclusions.  These aren’t things about which certainty is &lt;br /&gt;attainable. &lt;br /&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, they tell me Oaktree is now on social media.  That means you can follow @oaktree on Twitter to &lt;br /&gt;receive updates about my memos, videos and speaking engagements, and to hear from others at the &lt;br /&gt;firm.

&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: What Does the Market Know? &lt;br /&gt;My buddy Sandy was an airline pilot.  When asked to describe his job, he always answers, “hours of &lt;br /&gt;boredom punctuated by moments of terror.”  The same can be true for investment managers, for whom &lt;br /&gt;the last few weeks have been an example of t  he latter.  We’ve seen bad news and prices cascading &lt;br /&gt;downward.  Investors who thought stocks were priced &lt;br /&gt;right 20% ago and oil $70 ago now wonder if they &lt;br /&gt;aren’t risky at their new reduced prices. &lt;br /&gt;In Thursday’s memo, “On the Couch,” I mentioned the two questions I’d been getting most often: “What &lt;br /&gt;are t   he implications for the U.S. and the rest of the world of China’s weakness, and are we moving toward &lt;br /&gt;a new crisis of the magnitude of what  we saw  in 2008?”  Bloomberg invited me on the air Friday morning &lt;br /&gt;to discuss the memo, and the anchors mostly asked one version or another of a third question: “does the &lt;br /&gt;market’s decline worry you?”  That prompted this memo in response. &lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in a question: “what    does the market know ?”  Is the market smart, meaning you &lt;br /&gt;should take your lead from it?  Or is it dumb, meaning you should ignore it?  Here’s what I wrote in “It’s &lt;br /&gt;Not  Easy” in September and included in “On the Couch”: &lt;br /&gt;Especially during downdrafts, many investors impute intelligence to the market and look &lt;br /&gt;to it to tell them what’s going on and what to do about it.  This is one of the biggest &lt;br /&gt;mistakes you can make.  As Ben Graham pointed out, the day-to-day market isn’t a &lt;br /&gt;fundamental analyst; it’s a barometer of investor sentiment.  You just can’t take it &lt;br /&gt;too seriously.  Market participants have limited insight into what’s really happening in &lt;br /&gt;terms of fundamentals, and any intelligence that could be behind their buys and sells is &lt;br /&gt;obscured by their emotional swings.  It would be wrong to interpret the recent worldwide &lt;br /&gt;drop as meaning the market “knows” tough times lay ahead.  &lt;br /&gt;The rest of this memo will be about fleshing out this theme (meaning you can stop reading here if you’ve &lt;br /&gt;had enough or are short on time). &lt;br /&gt;The Nature of Consensus Opinion &lt;br /&gt;I based the above reference to Ben Graham on his famous observation that in the long run the market’s a &lt;br /&gt;weighing machine, but in the short run it’s a voting machine.  In other words, in the long term the &lt;br /&gt;consensus of investors figures out what things are really worth and moves the price there.  But in the short &lt;br /&gt;term, the market merely reflects consensus opinion regarding an asset’s future popularity, something &lt;br /&gt;that’s highly susceptible to the ups and downs of psychology. &lt;br /&gt;So, what does the market know?  First it’s important to understand for this purpose that there really &lt;br /&gt;isn’t such a thing as “the market.”  There’s just a bunch of people who participate in a market.  The &lt;br /&gt;market isn’t more than the sum of the participants, and it doesn’t “know” any more than their collective &lt;br /&gt;knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very important point.  If you believe the market has some special insight that exceeds the &lt;br /&gt;collective insight of its participants, then you and I have a fundamental disagreement.  The thinking of the &lt;br /&gt;crow d isn’t    synergistic.  In my view, the investment IQ  of the market isn’t   any higher than the average IQ &lt;br /&gt;of the participants.  And everyone who transacts gets a volume-weighted vote in setting an asset’s price at &lt;br /&gt;a given point in time. &lt;br /&gt;People of all different levels of ability act together to set the price.  They vary all over the lot in terms of &lt;br /&gt;knowledge, experience, insight and emotionalism.  The  market   doesn’t  give t he ones who are superior in &lt;br /&gt;these regards any more influence than the others, especially in the short run.  My botto&lt;br /&gt;m line on this &lt;br /&gt;subject is that the market price merely reflects the average insight of t  he market participants.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s point number one. &lt;br /&gt;If  anything, I think it’s emotion that’s synergistic.  It  builds into herd behavior or mass hysteria.  When &lt;br /&gt;10,000 people panic, the emotion seems to snowball.  People influence each other, and their emotions &lt;br /&gt;compound, so that the overall level of panic in the market can be hig&lt;br /&gt;her than the panic of any participant &lt;br /&gt;in isolation.  That’s something I’ll retur  n to later. &lt;br /&gt;Now  let’ s think about t  he first goal of investing: to buy low.  We want to buy things whose price &lt;br /&gt;underestimates the value of the underlying assets or earnings (value investing) or the future potential &lt;br /&gt;(growth investing).  In either case, we’re looking for instances when the market is wrong.  If we &lt;br /&gt;thought the market was always right – the efficient market hypothesis – we wouldn’t spend our lives as &lt;br /&gt;active investors.  Since we do, we’d better believe we know more than the consensus.  So by definition &lt;br /&gt;we must not &lt;br /&gt;think the market – that is, the sum of all other investors – knows everything, or knows &lt;br /&gt;more than we do, or is always right.  That’s point number two. &lt;br /&gt;And that leads logically to point number three: why take instruction from a group of people who &lt;br /&gt;know less than you do?  In “On the Couch,” I wrote that it all seems obvious: investors rarely maintain &lt;br /&gt;objective, rational, neutral and stable positions.  Do you agree with that or not?  Is the market a clinical &lt;br /&gt;and rational fundamental analyst, or a barometer of investor sentiment?  Does the market’s behavior these &lt;br /&gt;days look like something a mature adult should emulate? &lt;br /&gt;It seems clear to me: the market does no&lt;br /&gt;t have above average insight, but it often is above average &lt;br /&gt;in emotionality.  Thus we shouldn’t follow its dictates.  In fact, contrarianism is built  on the premise &lt;br /&gt;that we generally should do the opposite of what the crowd is doing, especially at the extremes, and I &lt;br /&gt;prefer it.   &lt;br /&gt;A Case in Point – The Crash of 2008 &lt;br /&gt;The year 2008 culminated in the greatest panic I’ve ever seen.  The events that built up to it included: &lt;br /&gt;massive subprime mortgage defaults and the failure of mortgage backed vehicles,&lt;br /&gt;meltdowns at funds that had invested in those vehicles, notably two Bear Stearns funds,&lt;br /&gt;the collapse of Bear Stearns, necessitating its purchase by JPMorgan for almost no consideration,&lt;br /&gt;rescues of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America; Wachovia by Wells Fargo; and Washington&lt;br /&gt;Mutual by JPMorgan (after it was first seized by the Office of Thrift Supervision),&lt;br /&gt;decisions on the part of BofA and Barclays not to acquire Lehman Brothers, and on the part of the&lt;br /&gt;U.S. Treasury not t&lt;br /&gt;o bail it out, leading to Lehman’s bankruptcy filing,&lt;br /&gt;the appearance that Morgan Stanley would be next if it couldn’t secure additional capital, and&lt;br /&gt;widespread speculation regarding other firms that might follow.&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A massive downward spiral ensued.  Among the contributing factors were: &lt;br /&gt;precipitous declines in the prices of bank stocks,&lt;br /&gt;large-scale short selling of the stocks (the “uptick rule” previously mandated that a stock could&lt;br /&gt;only be sold short at a price above the last trade, meaning short selling couldn’t force the price&lt;br /&gt;down.  But the rule was repealed in 2007, so there ceased to be limits on when stocks could be&lt;br /&gt;shorted.  Thus short sellers could force stock prices down –&lt;br /&gt; whether intentionally, in what in the&lt;br /&gt;1920s were called “bear raids,” or just because they thought the stocks were right to sell),&lt;br /&gt;dramatic increases in the cost to insure the debt of banks through credit default swaps.&lt;br /&gt;In the environment described above, the downward spiral in bank stocks was intensified by the following &lt;br /&gt;factors (whether they were intentionally manipulated, I can’t say for sure): &lt;br /&gt;It was easy to bet against the banks by buying credit default swaps (CDS) on their debt.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to depress bank stocks by selling them short.&lt;br /&gt;The declining stock prices were taken as a sign that the banks were weakening, causing the cost&lt;br /&gt;of buying CDS protection to rise.&lt;br /&gt;The rising cost of CDS protection was taken as an additional negative sign, causing the stocks to&lt;br /&gt;fall further.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you, it had the feel of an unstoppable vicious circle.  Some compared it to the “China &lt;br /&gt;Syndrome”: a 1979 movie with Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas in which an out-of-control nuclear &lt;br /&gt;reaction threatens to propel reactor components through the earth’s core, from the U.S. to China.  Thus &lt;br /&gt;the stock of panic-ridden Morgan Stanley (for example) fell 82%, to less than $10. &lt;br /&gt;But it’s important to note that the negative feedback loop described above was able to continue without &lt;br /&gt;reference to – and not necessarily in reasonable relationship to – actual developments at the banks or &lt;br /&gt;changes in their i&lt;br /&gt;ntrinsic value.  Eventually, however, the Treasury restricted short selling in the stocks of &lt;br /&gt;19 financial institutions deemed “systemically important.”  Morgan Stanley secured a $9 billion injection &lt;br /&gt;of convertible equity from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.  The panic subsided.  The economy and &lt;br /&gt;capital markets recovered.  And Morgan Stanley’s stock traded at &lt;br /&gt;$33 a year later. &lt;br /&gt;Do you wish you had taken the market’s instruction in 2008 and sold bank stocks?  Or do you wish &lt;br /&gt;you had rejected its advice and bought instead?  In short, did the market know anything? &lt;br /&gt;There are three possible answers: &lt;br /&gt;The market was flat wrong in 2008 when it took Morgan Stanley’s stock so low.&lt;br /&gt;The market was right; it properly reflected the possibility of a meltdown that could have&lt;br /&gt;happened but didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;The market was wrong in the case of Morgan Stanley in 2008, but most of the time it isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;I like the first, and the second is appealing as well.  But while a meltdown certainly was possible, the &lt;br /&gt;below-$10 price probably assigned it too high a likelihood.  And, of course, I’m not persuaded by the &lt;br /&gt;third. &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Case in Point – Senior Loans in the Financial Crisis &lt;br /&gt;While on the subject of 2008, I want to review the performance of senior loans.  In the old days, banks &lt;br /&gt;made corporate loans, sometimes sharing part with a syndicate of a few friendly banks but retaining the &lt;br /&gt;rest.  More recently the custom changed, with banks syndicating their loans widely to buyers of all types &lt;br /&gt;and retaining rather little.  This process has more in common with investment banks’ underwriting of &lt;br /&gt;securities than with the commercial banks’ prior lending process. &lt;br /&gt;Senior loans became a significant area of activity for credit investors like us.  They’re typically their &lt;br /&gt;issuers’ senior-most debt, so they’re perceived to carry little credit risk.  And since they pay interest at &lt;br /&gt;floating rates, there is no interest rate risk.  (Of course, with so little risk, they offer low yields.)  They’re &lt;br /&gt;the highest-quality instruments I’ve ever &lt;br /&gt;dealt in. &lt;br /&gt;Because they were considered so safe, loans were widely deemed appropriate for levered investment, and &lt;br /&gt;prior to the financial crisis large numbers of highly levered Collateralized Loan Obligations, or CLOs, &lt;br /&gt;were formed to hold them.  Borrowing at low floating rates to buy senior debt paying high floating rates &lt;br /&gt;was very enticing, and the CLO business mushroomed.   &lt;br /&gt;Senior loans w&lt;br /&gt;ere affected dramatically by the events of 2008.  Since senior loans had been used to fund &lt;br /&gt;buyouts with purchase prices at high multiples of cash flow, investors became concerned about the &lt;br /&gt;issuers’ ability to service them, and especially to refinance them when they came due (since the capital &lt;br /&gt;markets had slammed shut).  Loan prices fell to levels never seen before in the absence of a default; &lt;br /&gt;whereas non-distressed senior loans had rarely sold below 95 in the past, now they fell to the 80s, and &lt;br /&gt;then to the 60s.  Because of the collapsing prices, “market-value” CLOs receiv&lt;br /&gt;ed margin calls they &lt;br /&gt;couldn’t meet, and banks seized portfolios and liquidated them in overnight BWIC (bid-wanted-in-&lt;br /&gt;competition) transactions.  The indiscriminate selling put further pressure on prices, leading to more &lt;br /&gt;margin calls and more BWICs: another prototypical negative feedback loop.   &lt;br /&gt;The senior loan index was down 29% in 2008.  That exceeded the 25% decline of the high yield bond &lt;br /&gt;index.  Why would senior debt fall more during a crisis than junior debt?  The answer is that senior loans &lt;br /&gt;had been ground zero for buying with leverage (and thus for margin calls and forced selling) whereas &lt;br /&gt;high yield bonds had not. &lt;br /&gt;The key questions were rarely asked while things melted down: what were the loans worth, and would &lt;br /&gt;they pay?  That depended on the outlook for defaults, but in late 2008 few people felt they could assess it &lt;br /&gt;or could take the time required to do so.  And neither did they question the extent to which the price &lt;br /&gt;collapses had been caused by margin calls and forced selling, rather than investment fundamentals.  &lt;br /&gt;They just succumbed to negativity and sold. &lt;br /&gt;When 2008 ended, and with it the cycle of selling, price declines, margin calls, more selling and more &lt;br /&gt;price declines, the prices of loans stopped going down.  And then they went up.  The senior loan index &lt;br /&gt;rose 45% in 2009, meaning someone who invested on December 31, 2007 and didn’t sell was up 3% &lt;br /&gt;overall by December 31, 2009.  What if you had taken the market’s advice in the post-Lehman meltdown &lt;br /&gt;and sold in response to the negative signal?  You’d have a valid complaint, but whom would you blame?  &lt;br /&gt;The market . . . or yourself? &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Does a Falling Market Say About Value? &lt;br /&gt;What do big price declines mean?  They mean market participants sense fundamental deterioration.  But &lt;br /&gt;what price declines say is reflective, not predictive.  They tell you about the events that have occurred, &lt;br /&gt;and how investors have reacted to them.  They don’t tell you anything that the average investor doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;know about future events.  And, again, I’m firmly convinced (a) the average investor doesn’t know much, &lt;br /&gt;and (b) following average opinion won’t help you attain above average results. &lt;br /&gt;Most of my readers want to perform better than the average investor.  As I’ve set out in “Dare to Be Great &lt;br /&gt;II” (April 2014) and in the discussion of “second level thinking” in my book The Most Important Thing, &lt;br /&gt;to accomplish that, you have to invest differently than the average investor.  To do that, you have to think &lt;br /&gt;differently than the average investor.  And to do that, you have to consider different inputs than the &lt;br /&gt;average investor&lt;br /&gt;, or consider inputs differently.  You simply can’t follow the signals their behavior &lt;br /&gt;provides.   &lt;br /&gt;It’s a matter &lt;br /&gt;of logic: if price movements reflect average opinion, following their supposed advice &lt;br /&gt;can’t help you perform above average. &lt;br /&gt;Now let’s think about the question of whether to sell.  Here are some possible reasons to do so: &lt;br /&gt;Belief that&lt;br /&gt; the price is high relative to the fundamentals.&lt;br /&gt;Belief that while the current price may not be high relative to the current fundamentals, the&lt;br /&gt;fundamentals will deteriorate in ways that aren’t anticipated by the price.  (In other words, the&lt;br /&gt;price is high relative to how the fundamentals will come to be viewed.)&lt;br /&gt;Belief that the price will fall regardless of the fundamentals, meaning that by selling today you&lt;br /&gt;can avert a loss and/or position yourself to profit by buying lower later.&lt;br /&gt;Do you agree that&lt;br /&gt; these are the main reasons to sell?  Are there others?  Are these all legitimate? &lt;br /&gt;For me the first two are compelling.  This is what the skilled investor thinks about.  Both of these &lt;br /&gt;decisions are made relative to something called “intrinsic value.”  There’s only one intelligent form of &lt;br /&gt;investing: figure out what something's worth and see if you can buy it at or below that price.  It’s all &lt;br /&gt;about value. &lt;br /&gt;But note that t&lt;br /&gt;he third reason to sell shown above has nothing to do with value.  The price may be high, &lt;br /&gt;low or fair relative to the fundamentals today or what they’re expected to be tomorrow.  You just sell &lt;br /&gt;because you think the price will fall.   &lt;br /&gt;First, does it&lt;br /&gt; make sense to sell something if the price is low relative to the fundamentals, just &lt;br /&gt;because you fear it may fall in the short run?  A long-term value investor holds or buys when price is &lt;br /&gt;low relativ&lt;br /&gt;e to value.  Low price relative to value is his dream.  Why sell a low-priced asset just because &lt;br /&gt;you think it’s going to fall for a while?  Most people understand the challenge in dealing with “two-&lt;br /&gt;decision stocks”: you sell because you think the price may fall (even though it may be something you’d &lt;br /&gt;like to hold for the long term), and then you have to figure out when to buy it back.  Last year Charlie &lt;br /&gt;Munger complained to me that they’re really “three-decision stocks”: you sell it because you think the &lt;br /&gt;price is full, you have to figure out when to buy it back, and in the meantime you have to come up with &lt;br /&gt;something else to do with your money.  In my experience, most people who are lucky enough to sell &lt;br /&gt;something before it goes down get so busy patting themselves on the back that they forget to buy it &lt;br /&gt;back.  &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other t  hings being equal, as something fall   s in price, you should want to own it more, not less.  The &lt;br /&gt;buy-and-hold value investor i  s stalwart, ignoring pric e fluctuations.  Even better, the contrarian moves &lt;br /&gt;opposite t   o the market, buying when the price falls and selli  ng when it rises.   &lt;br /&gt;Second, i  f not on the basis of fundamentals, how does one make the decision to sell f  or the third &lt;br /&gt;reason listed above?  Essentially, two things give rise to changes in asset prices: changes in the outlook &lt;br /&gt;(macro or asset-specific) and changes in attitudes toward the asset.  In other words, fundamentals and &lt;br /&gt;valuation.  Fundamentals are dealt with above.  If you’re going to try to benefit from changes in price &lt;br /&gt;that are unrelated to changes in fundamentals, you’re left having to predict investor psychology.  If “On &lt;br /&gt;the Couch” wasn’t successful in convincing you this isn’t possible, this memo probably won’t be, either. &lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is that markets don’t assess intrinsic value from day to day, and certainly t hey don’t do a &lt;br /&gt;good job during crises.  Thus market &lt;br /&gt;price movements don’t say much about fundamentals.  Even in the &lt;br /&gt;best of times, when investors are driven by fundamentals rather than psychology, markets show &lt;br /&gt;what the participants think value is, rather than what value really is.  Value is something the market &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t know any more about th an the average investor.  And advice from the average investor &lt;br /&gt;obviously can’t help you be an above &lt;br /&gt;average investor. &lt;br /&gt;What Does a Falling Market Say About Psychology? &lt;br /&gt;Fundamentals – the outlook for an economy, company or asset – don’   t change much from day to day.  As &lt;br /&gt;a result, daily price changes are mostly about (a) changes in market psychology and thus (b) &lt;br /&gt;changes in who wants to own something or un-own something.  These two statements become &lt;br /&gt;increasingly valid the more daily pric es fluctuate.  Big fluctuations show that psychology is changing &lt;br /&gt;radically. &lt;br /&gt;And, I said on page two, emotional fluctuations – swings in market sentiment or psychology – do seem to &lt;br /&gt;be synergistic.  That i  s, in crowd psychology, 2 + 2 = 5.  While I don’t thi nk th e price of an asset &lt;br /&gt;reflects more wisdom than is possessed by the average of its market’s members, I do believe mass &lt;br /&gt;psychology will make a group s&lt;br /&gt;wing to reach greater emotional extremes than its members would &lt;br /&gt;separately.  In short, people make each other crazy. And when times are bad – like now – they depress &lt;br /&gt;each other.  That was a factor in the edge enjoyed by our distressed debt team in 2008: they were able to &lt;br /&gt;buy at the market’s lows because they weren’t in N ew York, where everyone was trading scary stories &lt;br /&gt;and getting each other down. &lt;br /&gt;Again, we can gain insight through logic.  We all know we want t  o buy (not sell ) at the lows, and sell &lt;br /&gt;(not buy) at the highs.  So then how can it be right t  o sell because of a decline or buy because of a &lt;br /&gt;rise?  Advocates of t  hi  s latter approach must think (a) declines and rises tend to continue more than they &lt;br /&gt;rever  se and/   or (b) th ey can tel l which declines mean “buy” and which mean “sell.”  Some savants may &lt;br /&gt;have that l  att   er ability, but not many.  In general, I think it’ s ridiculous to sel l something because it’s &lt;br /&gt;down (just as it i  s t   o buy because it’ s up).   &lt;br /&gt;As prices fall, there are some very genuine reasons to sell: &lt;br /&gt;Some people feel risi&lt;br /&gt;ng fear and have to lighten their positions in order to retain their composure.&lt;br /&gt;Some, having lost a lot of money, sell to be sure they won’t experience losses they can’t survive.&lt;br /&gt;Some have to sell to repay demanding creditors or satisfy investor withdrawals.&lt;br /&gt;These reasons are not “invalid.”  It’s just that none of them has anything to do with making money.&lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most mature investors know intellectually that short-term price fluctuations are low in fundamental &lt;br /&gt;significance, and that the best results will be achieved if they hold on to their positions and ride out the &lt;br /&gt;volatility.  But sometimes people sell anyway, perhaps for the above reasons.  Doing so has the potential &lt;br /&gt;to convert a short-term fluctuation into &lt;br /&gt;a permanent loss by causing any subsequent recovery to be &lt;br /&gt;missed.  I consider this the cardinal sin in investing. &lt;br /&gt;What Do the Media Know? &lt;br /&gt;I’m usually able to find something in the print or broadcast media that helps me make my point.  Here’s &lt;br /&gt;how The New York Times led the business section on Saturday: &lt;br /&gt;Concern Grows That Market Sell-off is an Early Warning of a U.S. Slowdown &lt;br /&gt;It may be time for everyone to take the markets seriously again. &lt;br /&gt;As stock prices&lt;br /&gt; started tumbling in the first trading days of the year, many Wall Street &lt;br /&gt;professionals were tempted to describe the declines as the sort of adjustment that the &lt;br /&gt;market has gone through in recent years before moving higher. &lt;br /&gt;But that opinion evaporated this week as the selling intensified.  Concerns are now &lt;br /&gt;growing that the markets are signaling that the United States economy, despite its recent &lt;br /&gt;bright spots, is on the verge of a slowdown. &lt;br /&gt;The fear is that economic problems in China have set off negative reactions around the &lt;br /&gt;world that could ultimately weigh on American households and corporations. &lt;br /&gt;So the bottom-line question is simple: does the market reflect what people know, or should people &lt;br /&gt;base their actions on what the market knows?  And if the latter, where does “the market” get its &lt;br /&gt;information, other than from people?  For me it’  s simple: if people follow the market’s dictates, they’re &lt;br /&gt;taking advice from . . . themselves! &lt;br /&gt;I set a trap at the beginning of this memo, and I want to spring it now.  In the first paragraph, I wrote, &lt;br /&gt;“We’ve seen bad news and prices cascading downward.”  You probably glossed over it.  But is it true?  &lt;br /&gt;Leaving aside China and the markets’ gyrations, have we really been seeing negative news on balance?  &lt;br /&gt;Isn’t it just that people are fixating on bad news, ignoring good news, and tending to interpret things &lt;br /&gt;negatively? &lt;br /&gt;There are ways in which psychology can become “real,” feeding back to i&lt;br /&gt;nfluence fundamentals.  One is &lt;br /&gt;that   declining asset prices produce a negative “wealth effect,” making people feel poorer and causing &lt;br /&gt;them to spend and invest less.  And there are others.  But despite t   he feedback influences of the market &lt;br /&gt;declines, I still would say U.S. and European economic fundamentals aren’t negative on balance. &lt;br /&gt;On Friday, in the midst of the declines, I participated in a small lunch attended by investment &lt;br /&gt;professionals and current and former senior government economic and financial leaders.  I’ll spare you &lt;br /&gt;the details: there was a &lt;br /&gt;lot of “on one hand” and “on the other hand,” but no one thought there &lt;br /&gt;would be a recession this year.  So then who are t   he people creating price signals to which others should &lt;br /&gt;accord significance?   &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*            *            * &lt;br /&gt;I want to end by making one thing completely clear.  I’m not saying the market is never right when prices &lt;br /&gt;go down (or up).  I’m merely saying the market has no special insight and conveys no consistently helpful &lt;br /&gt;message.  It’s not that it’s always wrong; it’s that there’s no reason to presume it’s right. &lt;br /&gt;It is the goal of some investors to sell on declines when the subsequent movements will be down, but &lt;br /&gt;“buy the dips” when the subsequent movements will be up.  If you think you can tell which is which from &lt;br /&gt;watching the market movements themselves, then we – again – have a fundamental disagreement.  Future &lt;br /&gt;price movements can only be predicted on the basis of the relationship between price and &lt;br /&gt;fundamentals.  And, given the market’s short-term volatility and irrationality, this can only be done in the &lt;br /&gt;long-term sense.&lt;br /&gt;  The market has nothing useful to contribute on this subject. &lt;br /&gt;January 19, 2016 &lt;br /&gt;2016 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: This Time It’s Different &lt;br /&gt;I first came across the title of this memo in an article titled “Why This Market Cycle Isn’t Different” &lt;br /&gt;by Anise C. Wallace in The New York Times of October 11, 1987.  It went as follows: &lt;br /&gt;The four most dangerous words in investing are “this time it’s different,” according &lt;br /&gt;to John Templeton, the highly regarded 74-year-old mutual fund manager.  At stock &lt;br /&gt;market tops and bottoms, investors invariably use this rationale to justify their &lt;br /&gt;emotion-driven decisions. &lt;br /&gt;Over the next year, many investors are likely to repeat these four words as they &lt;br /&gt;defend higher stock prices.  But they should treat them with the same consideration &lt;br /&gt;they give “the check is in the mail. . . .”  &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, in the bull market’s sixth year, the “this time it’s different” chorus is &lt;br /&gt;beginning to be heard.  Wall Street professionals predict that, before the bull market &lt;br /&gt;ends, individual investors, who have mostly stayed on the sidelines, will be swept &lt;br /&gt;along in the mania characterizing a market peak. &lt;br /&gt;They will invest in stocks despite the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial average has &lt;br /&gt;more than tripled in the last five years.  They will be hearing overwhelmingly &lt;br /&gt;compelling reasons why stock prices should go higher, why the bull market should &lt;br /&gt;last considerably longer than any other in history, why this boom will not be followed &lt;br /&gt;by a 1929-like crash and why “this time it’s different.” &lt;br /&gt;Many of these arguments will be tempting because they will have some element of &lt;br /&gt;truth to them.  Even Mr. Templeton concedes that when people say things are &lt;br /&gt;different, 20 percent of the time they are right.  But the danger lies in thinking that the &lt;br /&gt;different factor – like the recent investment in United States stocks by the Japanese – &lt;br /&gt;will be uninterrupted. &lt;br /&gt;Wallace’s essential message is that investors must take heed when the four words are in &lt;br /&gt;widespread use.  Why?  Look back at the paragraph introducing the above quote: when you first &lt;br /&gt;read it, did you happen to notice the date of publication?  It was just eight days before Black &lt;br /&gt;Monday (October 19, 1987), the worst day in stock market history.  We know how bad it feels &lt;br /&gt;when the market falls 20% in a year.  Try 22% in a day!!  Wallace’s warning was particularly &lt;br /&gt;important at the time the article was published, but for me it’s always important. &lt;br /&gt;*           *            * &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically in investing, historical norms put limits on asset prices.  Thus, for example, bull markets &lt;br /&gt;can generally go to extremes only if investors discard the notion that the p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 &lt;br /&gt;stock index shouldn’t go much above its post-World War II average of 15 or 16.  If the earnings of &lt;br /&gt;the S&amp;P’s underlying companies grow at 10% a year, by definition the index can rise 20% a year (as &lt;br /&gt;it did in the 1990s) only if the ratio of price to earnings is viewed as highly expandable.  It was such a &lt;br /&gt;perspective that allowed the index to reach 32 times earnings at the start of this century (with highly &lt;br /&gt;negative implications for equity returns in 2000-02). &lt;br /&gt;Think of a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral.  Gravity has to be overcome in order for it &lt;br /&gt;to escape the earth’s atmosphere.  Likewise, the limitations imposed by past norms have to be &lt;br /&gt;overcome in order for asset prices to slip their historic moorings and blast off into outer space. &lt;br /&gt;Today we’re not hearing much about historic valuations being irrelevant, as they’re not terribly high.  &lt;br /&gt;Instead, what we’re told is different this time is the relevance of restrictions on future economic &lt;br /&gt;and market performance: &lt;br /&gt;There doesn’t have to be a recession.&lt;br /&gt;Continuous quantitative easing can lead to permanent prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;Federal deficits can grow substantially larger without becoming problematic.&lt;br /&gt;National debt isn’t worrisome.&lt;br /&gt;We can have economic strength without inflation.&lt;br /&gt;Interest rates can remain “lower for longer.”&lt;br /&gt;The inverted yield curve needn’t have negative implications.&lt;br /&gt;Companies and stocks can thrive even in the absence of profits.&lt;br /&gt;Growth investing can continue to outperform value investing in perpetuity.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely   participate in a meeting these days without someone asking about one or more of these &lt;br /&gt;propositions.  The bottom line is that for  any of   the nine to be true  , things really have to be &lt;br /&gt;different this time.  I’ll discuss the outlook for each below. &lt;br /&gt;The  avoidable recession –  The  questions I get most often these days   are “Is  the U.S. heading for a &lt;br /&gt;recession?” and “When will it start?”  My answer to the  first   is a simple “yes.”  (At least I can never &lt;br /&gt;be proved wrong.)  We’ve always had economic cycles, and I believe    we always will.  Eventually, &lt;br /&gt;favorable developments will lead people to engage in behavior premised on excessively optimistic &lt;br /&gt;assumptions, and eventually the over-optimism of those assumptions will be exposed and the &lt;br /&gt;e&lt;br /&gt;xcesses will correct in a period of negative growth.  Moreover, even economies that   aren’t marked &lt;br /&gt;by  excesses are subject to exogenous shocks.   &lt;br /&gt;When people ask about the coming recession, what they mostly    mean is “Might it be a long way &lt;br /&gt;off?”  Well, the longest U.S. recovery on record lasted ten years, and the current one is in the twelfth &lt;br /&gt;month of its  tenth year.  There’s no reason a recovery can’t  go beyond ten years; no gate will  come &lt;br /&gt;down on June 30, foreclosing further progress.  And it’s  important to note that since this has been the &lt;br /&gt;most    sluggish U.S. recovery since   World War II, it hasn’t  been characterized by excesses to the &lt;br /&gt;upside, meaning there needn’t be a recessionary correction on the usual schedule.   &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon, the current recovery is bound to become the longest in U.S. history.  However, I believe &lt;br /&gt;the odds are that it’s closer to the end than the beginning.  (We never know for sure what’s going to &lt;br /&gt;happen in the future.  At best we can think in terms of the probabilities.  That’s the thinking behind &lt;br /&gt;my latest book’s subtitle: Getting the Odds on Your Side.)  The recovery is likely to go on longer, but &lt;br /&gt;perhaps not much longer.  Still, I wouldn’t place a wager on when it will end. &lt;br /&gt;About a year and a half ago, following the enactment of President Trump’s stimulative tax cuts, &lt;br /&gt;people started to ask me whether the U.S. might emulate Australia, whose last recession was in 1990.  &lt;br /&gt;While not quite the same as asking “might there never be another recession?” the idea of 28 years &lt;br /&gt;between recessions would represent a radical difference this time. &lt;br /&gt;My answer to the above question is “probably not,” since there are significant differences between &lt;br /&gt;the two countries that probably render Australia’s example inapplicable to the U.S.:   &lt;br /&gt;A much bigger part of Australia’s GDP is based on exporting natural resources such as iron&lt;br /&gt;ore and coal, of which it has so much.  Thus in recent decades it has drafted off the unusually&lt;br /&gt;strong growth of its much larger neighbor to the north, China.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, “. . . having a conservative, domestically focused, highly concentrated banking&lt;br /&gt;system meant that Australia wasn’t stuck importing other countries’ financial contagions&lt;br /&gt;when crises hit.”  (The New York Times, April 7, 2019)&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I see in Australia a conservatism and discipline capable of extending financial good&lt;br /&gt;times without creating excesses.  My favorite example is the Australia Future Fund, which&lt;br /&gt;the government formed in 2006 to deal with the country’s pension liabilities, with funding&lt;br /&gt;that came from fiscal surpluses (!) and the privatization of Telstra, the formerly state-owned&lt;br /&gt;telecommunications company.  The fund’s assets, now standing at A$154 billion, were&lt;br /&gt;essentially put into a lockbox until 2020, which now appears likely to extend until at least&lt;br /&gt;2026.  What’s the likelihood that U.S. politicians would (a) fund government pension&lt;br /&gt;obligations up front, rather than deal with them on a pay-as-you-go basis, and (b) keep their&lt;br /&gt;hands off the assets for 20 years, rather than use them to pay for constituent-pleasing&lt;br /&gt;spending increases or tax cuts?&lt;br /&gt;So no, I don’t think the U.S. is    about to emulate Australia’s 28-years-and-counting recovery.  That I &lt;br /&gt;will   bet on.  &lt;br /&gt;Perpetual prosperity from quantitative easing – In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the &lt;br /&gt;Fed engaged in quantitative easing, a program  of purchasing bonds in the    open market.  The effect of &lt;br /&gt;the  Fed’s  purchases was to (a) inject bank reserves into the financial system, (b) strengthen the &lt;br /&gt;demand for bonds, thereby bringing down long-term interest rates (which are  unaffected by the Fed’s &lt;br /&gt;normal open market operations related to short-term rates), and (c) with prospective returns on high-&lt;br /&gt;quality bonds brought  down, reignite risk-bearing on the part of investors seeking higher returns, &lt;br /&gt;thereby causing the credit window to reopen.  QE was  a success in the    U.S., and the economy &lt;br /&gt;recovered.  Thus some people are now proposing  that   the  Fed could engage in QE forever, with &lt;br /&gt;similarly positive   results. &lt;br /&gt;First   , I think some part  of the impact of QE may  be psychological.  In other words, QE stimulates the &lt;br /&gt;economy in part because people accept that   QE is   stimulative.  If the Fed took exactly the same &lt;br /&gt;actions but did so without making an announcement, would the effect be the same?  (I believe there’s &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a self-fulfilling, placebo-like component to many of the  Fed’s  tactics.)  In this regard, I think its first &lt;br /&gt;round of QE w  as more effective than its s  e    cond, and its s ec ond round was more e ffective than its &lt;br /&gt;third.  Accordingly, there could be a d iminishing return from permanent QE, as    the psychological &lt;br /&gt;effect abates. &lt;br /&gt;And who knows exactly how QE works?  Last week, at a conference I attended, a participant &lt;br /&gt;suggested that under Modern Monetary Theory (see  more below ), the  Treasury could issue   a &lt;br /&gt;pot&lt;br /&gt;entially unlimited amount of debt, and if third-party buyers failed to take   it up, the Fed could buy &lt;br /&gt;it  under QE.  Does this seem   reasonable?  If the Fed  credits banks with reserves, the banks lend a &lt;br /&gt;multiple of those   reserves, and the borrowers use the loan proceeds to make purchases or &lt;br /&gt;investments, does the process  really   inject    money    into the economy, or is it mostly    a matter of &lt;br /&gt;bookkeeping?  Or are they one and the  same?  Of course, this questi  on is  relevant to all  nat&lt;br /&gt;ions with &lt;br /&gt;fiat   currencies.  &lt;br /&gt;Quantitative easing is generally considered to have contributed to the past  decade’s low prospective &lt;br /&gt;investment returns, resultant risk-taking, asset inflation, and increasing wealt  h divide. As with any &lt;br /&gt;other prescription, shouldn’t we worry about possible    side  effects like  these?  &lt;br /&gt;Can government actions permanently raise  the level of demand in an economy, or do they mostly &lt;br /&gt;accelerate future demand into the present?  If the latter, can QE elevate GDP  forever above what it &lt;br /&gt;otherwise would have been?  I doubt it.  But if it could, wouldn’t that   eventually cause   what   I call  an &lt;br /&gt;“excess,” leading to a recession?   &lt;br /&gt;Finally, when   I h ear   people talk about the possibility that the Fed will prevent a recession, I &lt;br /&gt;wonder whether it’s even   desirable for it to have that goal.  Per the above, are recessions really &lt;br /&gt;avoidable or merely postponable?  And if the latte  r, is  it better for them to occur naturally or be &lt;br /&gt;postponed unnaturally?   Might efforts to postpone them  create undue faith   in the power and &lt;br /&gt;intentions of the Fed, and thus a return of moral hazard?  And if the Fed  wards    off a series of &lt;br /&gt;little    recessions, mightn’t that just mean that, when the ability to keep doing so reaches its &lt;br /&gt;limit, the one that finally arrives will  be a doozy? &lt;br /&gt;Benign federal deficits –  Over the years, some in government have   pursued balanced federal budgets, &lt;br /&gt;or at    least have paid them lip service.  Democrats have generally been described as wanting to “tax &lt;br /&gt;and spend” in order to do more for &lt;br /&gt;citizens.  But they’ve sometimes spent before they’ve taxed.  &lt;br /&gt;Republicans, on the other hand, have positioned &lt;br /&gt;themselves as the party of fiscal restraint.  It’s  often &lt;br /&gt;bee  n their    off&lt;br /&gt;icial position  that there could be no increases in spending if not accompanied by &lt;br /&gt;corresponding increases in funding. &lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the  debate, federal budgets are  rarely   tendered on time or in balance these days.  We’ve &lt;br /&gt;had deficits in 46 of the last 50 years (with the exception of 1998-2001), and in recent years   they’ve &lt;br /&gt;rise  n as  a percentage of GDP  despite    the prosperity we’ve been enjoying.  Often there isn’t even a &lt;br /&gt;pretense of interest in fighting deficits.  Democrats have   big spending ideas even in the absence of &lt;br /&gt;ways to fund them.  And Republicans cut taxes but not always spending.   &lt;br /&gt;Both parties now seem to feel that the way to win elections is to simply ignore deficits.  In the &lt;br /&gt;1930s, John Maynard Keynes said that in periods when private economic activity isn’t generating &lt;br /&gt;enough demand to create full employment, governments should spend more than they take in, &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;counting on deficit spending to stimulate demand.  And then, during the resulting periods of growth, &lt;br /&gt;they should spend less than they take in, using the surplus to pay down the debt that was taken on to &lt;br /&gt;fund deficits.  But departing from this, at the end of 2017, in the ninth year of a recovery, the &lt;br /&gt;Republicans enacted sweeping tax-rate cuts capable of ballooning the deficit.   &lt;br /&gt;A new entrant in this area is receiving a lot of attention: Modern Monetary Theory (“MMT”).  One of &lt;br /&gt;its components is the belief that government deficits currently are too small, and in any event not a &lt;br /&gt;bad thing: &lt;br /&gt;Tax revenues are not what finance the government’s expenditures, argues Stephanie &lt;br /&gt;Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and one of the most influential &lt;br /&gt;modern monetary theorists.  What actually happens in a country that controls its own &lt;br /&gt;currency, she says, is that the government first decides what it’s going to spend.  In &lt;br /&gt;the United States, Congress agrees on a budget.  Then government agencies start &lt;br /&gt;handing out dollars to the public to pay for those tanks, earth movers and salaries. &lt;br /&gt;Afterward, it takes a portion back in the form of taxes.  If the government takes back &lt;br /&gt;less than it gave out, there will be a deficit. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;Ms. Kelton . . . points out that every dollar the government spends translates into a &lt;br /&gt;dollar of income for someone else.  So a deficit in the public sector simultaneously &lt;br /&gt;produces a surplus outside the government. . . .  (The New York Times, April 7, 2019) &lt;br /&gt;Thus, according to MMT, deficits are benign – not a sign of profligacy – and merely an &lt;br /&gt;indication that the government has put more money into the economy than it has taken out in &lt;br /&gt;taxes.  MMT is modern in that it has moved past the old-fashioned concept of balancing spending &lt;br /&gt;and revenues, opening the door for bigger deficits. &lt;br /&gt;Does Ms. Kelton think deficits don’t matter?  No, the Times article goes on: &lt;br /&gt;Of course they matter, she said. . . .  They can be too big, especially if they are not &lt;br /&gt;used to increase the nation’s productive capacity, or if there is a shortage of labor, &lt;br /&gt;raw materials and factories. &lt;br /&gt;In this connection, we should note that Ms. Kelton served as an economic adviser to Bernie Sanders &lt;br /&gt;in 2016.  Thus it may be reasonable to suspect that MMT is largely a rationale for governments to &lt;br /&gt;give away more free stuff, expanding their deficits.  Sometimes it can be hard to separate &lt;br /&gt;economic opinions from political leanings. &lt;br /&gt;This relaxed view of deficits reminds me of a hypothetical consumer who has a credit card with no &lt;br /&gt;credit limit.  He can spend whatever he wants without having to worry about paying off the balance.  &lt;br /&gt;In theory, this could work (although it’s challenging to figure out what’s in it for the card issuer).  &lt;br /&gt;But at a minimum it doesn’t allow for unforeseen developments.  I believe here, as elsewhere, the &lt;br /&gt;workings of economics are too uncertain for a perpetual motion machine like MMT to be relied &lt;br /&gt;upon.  In other words, Modern Monetary Theory is just that: a theory.  What if it’s wrong? &lt;br /&gt;. . . when the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business asked top scholars &lt;br /&gt;about a couple of [MMT’s] claims, they split between the 28 percent who disagreed &lt;br /&gt;and the 72 percent who strongly disagreed.

&lt;p&gt;Disregarded national debt – I recall a heated debate when I was young over whether it’s okay for &lt;br /&gt;nations to permanently be in debt.  More recently, any such doubt has been forgotten, and almost all &lt;br /&gt;nations are debtors.  The main issue became whether there can be a level of debt that’s too high.  But &lt;br /&gt;now, thanks to MMT, there’s a belief that there’s no such thing.  &lt;br /&gt;Continuing from the Times’s description of Modern Monetary Theory: &lt;br /&gt;“The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all of the dollars that &lt;br /&gt;were spent into the economy and not taxed back, and are currently being saved in the &lt;br /&gt;form of Treasury securities,” Ms. Kelton said. &lt;br /&gt;In other words, national debt is just a sign of all the government has accomplished. &lt;br /&gt;While I can’t prove that Modern Monetary Theory is off the beam, I also can’t see making it the &lt;br /&gt;economic law of the land.  Does it have a weakness?  I think there may be one hidden in the middle &lt;br /&gt;of the long quote above, regarding “a country that controls its own currency.”  I don’t know &lt;br /&gt;exactly what Ms. Kelton meant by this phrase, but it might be a reference to a country that can print &lt;br /&gt;as much money as it wants without having to worry about its currency depreciating, and thus one that &lt;br /&gt;is always able to issue and refinance debt without limits.   &lt;br /&gt;Today the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and there aren’t any obvious candidates to &lt;br /&gt;replace it.  Further, the U.S. benefits from an unlimited appetite for its debt, since it’s the safest of &lt;br /&gt;any major sovereign.  For these reasons, expanding the national debt isn’t a problem.  And like the &lt;br /&gt;cardholder described above, since there’s no limit to its credit, the U.S. can add the interest that &lt;br /&gt;accrues to the unpaid balance.   &lt;br /&gt;What happens if these conditions change?  Could a tipping point be reached at which there’s so &lt;br /&gt;much debt that people question the U.S.’s creditworthiness and ability to repay its borrowings?  &lt;br /&gt;In that case, the demanded interest rate would rise, meaning the debt and interest mightn’t be &lt;br /&gt;repayable without massive money printing that would result in debasement of the dollar.  Thus, could &lt;br /&gt;there come a day when it takes unacceptably more purchasing power to pay off U.S. debt &lt;br /&gt;denominated in dollars that have depreciated?   &lt;br /&gt;I put these questions to my friend Randy Kroszner, former member of the Fed’s Board of Governors &lt;br /&gt;and Deputy Dean at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.  Here’s his response: &lt;br /&gt;I think the last three decades for Japan and the last decade for the U.S. have shown &lt;br /&gt;(and continue to be showing) that countries with credible institutions can “get away &lt;br /&gt;with” higher debt levels without a raid by bond vigilantes than most had once &lt;br /&gt;thought.  That said, it leaves the country vulnerable to a change in sentiment, exactly &lt;br /&gt;as you describe.  “Getting away with it” for too long erodes the credibility of the &lt;br /&gt;institutions over time. &lt;br /&gt;Again, MMT might work, and vastly expanded national debt might prove viable or even &lt;br /&gt;advantageous.  But I wouldn’t bet the ranch on it.  &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic strength without inflation – For the last 60 years, there has been widespread (albeit not &lt;br /&gt;universal) acceptance of the so-called Phillips curve, which posits an inverse relationship between &lt;br /&gt;the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation.  In other words, as unemployment falls and the &lt;br /&gt;labor market tightens, workers gain bargaining power and employers have to compete for a declining &lt;br /&gt;number of available workers.  This results in rising wages, which translates into increasing inflation. &lt;br /&gt;The U.S. has seen unusually little unemployment during the Trump presidency, and today it’s at a &lt;br /&gt;50-year low.  Nevertheless, there hasn’t been much wage inflation until very recently, and there still&lt;br /&gt;isn’t much general inflation.&lt;br /&gt;There are reasons why the relationship underlying the Phillips curve as defined above might be &lt;br /&gt;different from what it was in the past: &lt;br /&gt;•Since the U.S. labor force participation rate (percentage of adults who are either employed or &lt;br /&gt;looking for work) is at its lowest level in more than 40 years, it might be more meaningful to &lt;br /&gt;look at the non-employment rate (the percentage of adults who aren’t working) rather than the &lt;br /&gt;unemployment rate (the percentage of adults looking for work who aren’t working).  By the &lt;br /&gt;former measure, the labor market isn’t so tight.&lt;br /&gt;•Inflation might be structurally lower now and in the future than it was in the past, altering its &lt;br /&gt;relationship to conditions in the labor market.  Automation, the shift of manufacturing to low-&lt;br /&gt;cost countries and the prevalence of free/cheap stuff in the digital age might help explain &lt;br /&gt;today’s unusually low rate of inflation.  For examples of the third of these, think about recent &lt;br /&gt;trends in the price of photographs, cellphone calls, messages (texts and emails versus &lt;br /&gt;telegrams and faxes) and books.&lt;br /&gt;•On the other hand, the cheapening of things like those listed just above could halt, and a more &lt;br /&gt;traditional relationship between inflation and unemployment could resume.&lt;br /&gt;Excessive inflation creates a number of serious economic and social problems,    typically requiring &lt;br /&gt;central banks  to raise interest rates  to cool it off, with the effect of dampening economic growth and &lt;br /&gt;job creation.  Likewise, rising inflation can cause investors to demand higher interest rates on bonds &lt;br /&gt;and loans to compensate for the risk of los&lt;br /&gt;ing purchasing power.  This can make it harder for &lt;br /&gt;borrowers to service thei  r debt  , causing defaults to rise and discouraging investors from taking risk &lt;br /&gt;and providing financing.  (On the other hand, the&lt;br /&gt;re’s   a level   of inflation that’s desired such that, &lt;br /&gt;among other things, workers will  see wage growth, and the U.S. can repay outstanding debt with &lt;br /&gt;dollars representing a reduced amount of purchasing  power.  Today that  desired rate is about 2%, and &lt;br /&gt;policymakers worry about the fact that it hasn’t materialized despite the low unemployment rate.) &lt;br /&gt;Rising inflation could be seen as  a potential contributor to the end of the recovery.  So far it hasn’t &lt;br /&gt;shown up despite the tightness of the labor market.  Has the Phillips curve   relationship been revoked &lt;br /&gt;for good, or is inflation in the offing?  Who knows? &lt;br /&gt;The word I use   to describe inflation is “mysterious.”  It’s rarely clear how it gets started, and in &lt;br /&gt;the 1970s and early ’80s, when it reached the mid-teens in the U.S., no one could figure out how to &lt;br /&gt;stop it until after Paul Volcker became Fed chair.  It’s mysterious why there’s so little inflation &lt;br /&gt;today, and whether there’ll be inflation in the future.  But I’m not confident that it’ll still be below &lt;br /&gt;2% a few years from now. &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistently low  interest rates – “Lower for longer” has been another rallying cry  of the bull market.  &lt;br /&gt;If interest rates remain low, economic growth is encouraged, defaults are scarce, risk-taking is &lt;br /&gt;encouraged and financing is easy.  So fa r – against the odds – the    strength of the U.S. economy &lt;br /&gt;hasn’t caused interest rates   to rise. &lt;br /&gt;The  Fed has raised interest rates  nine  times    since the end of 2015, taking the short-term fed funds rate &lt;br /&gt;from  roughly zero to 2¼-2½%, and in  late  2018 it s aid it would go further.  But in January, in &lt;br /&gt;response to fears   of ec&lt;br /&gt;onomic weakness that arose in 4Q2018, the Fed reversed course and declared &lt;br /&gt;that there would be no more increases for now.  Whereas the yield on the 10-yea  r Treasury note &lt;br /&gt;hitting 3¼% early last  October coincided with (and probably contributed to) the  start   of the stock &lt;br /&gt;market’s fourth-quarter swoon, the promise of low rates has  played a big part in the rally this year. &lt;br /&gt;In mid-2007, in a real economy that   felt  to me    a lot like this  one, the fed funds rate a  nd the yield on &lt;br /&gt;the 10-year Treasury note both were around 5¼%.  Today, with the fed funds rate and 10-year &lt;br /&gt;Treasury yield below 2½% instead, the Fed describes interest rates as “neutral”: neither low enough &lt;br /&gt;to be  stimulative nor high enough to be restrictive.  (I considered the 2007 rates to be neutral – how &lt;br /&gt;ca n that be true of rates at both levels?) &lt;br /&gt;Will    the Fed  leave    rates   low?  Can it do so if inflation strengthens?  Will it leave  rates so low &lt;br /&gt;that there’s little room to reduce them in the fu&lt;br /&gt;ture should stimulus be needed?  If deficits and &lt;br /&gt;deb  t grow faster than GDP, won’t that put upward pressure on interest rates?  Or if the Fed &lt;br /&gt;cuts   rates, as many people now consider likely, will   the mar&lt;br /&gt;kets   be cheered by the stimulus, or &lt;br /&gt;will   they fall in response to the economic concerns at which the rate cuts are directed?  &lt;br /&gt;Certainly no one can say. &lt;br /&gt;Equanimity regarding the inverted yield curve – Something else  we’ve   heard a lot about over the last &lt;br /&gt;couple of years is how risky   it is when the yield curve inverts.   &lt;br /&gt;The yield curve is usually upward-sloping, meaning lenders demand higher interest rates   when they &lt;br /&gt;lend for longer periods as compensation for the increased uncertainty (especially with regard to &lt;br /&gt;possible declines in the purchasing power of  the currency between the time   the loan is made and &lt;br /&gt;when it’s repaid).  But sometimes, long-term rates fall  below short-term rates, and the curve   is said to &lt;br /&gt;be “inverted.”  The curve has been unusually flat in recent mo&lt;br /&gt;nths, and today it’s  actually inverted. &lt;br /&gt;Because most   periods of inversion have been associated with recessions, the condition is considered &lt;br /&gt;worrisome.  In that regard, the Financial Times    noted on June 1 that “the [yield curve] has ‘inverted’ &lt;br /&gt;before every   US recession in 50 years.”  (Note, however, that this is different from saying every &lt;br /&gt;inversion has been followed by a recession.)  What people   should be focusing on isn’t the usual &lt;br /&gt;coincidence of inversions and recessions, but rather the  reason for this particular inversion.  &lt;br /&gt;Understanding the latte  r might allow observers to sense whether a recession is implied and avoid a &lt;br /&gt;“false positive.” &lt;br /&gt;The  explanation for inversions isn’t always clear, since interest rates  (like inflation) can be &lt;br /&gt;mysterious.  Today I would say the inversion of the curve may  be due to the    fact   that the Fed has &lt;br /&gt;brought short rates  up at the sa&lt;br /&gt;me time that (a) there’s a surplus of capital for investment at the  long &lt;br /&gt;end of the yield curve, putting downward pressure on rates there, and (b) there’s less reliance on &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;capital investment in the   information age  , so less demand for long-term debt capital.  One more thing &lt;br /&gt;that may be bringing down long-term yields   is  an increase in general worry among investors, and &lt;br /&gt;thus  a flight   to the safety  of  Treasurys.  When demand for bonds rises , sellers are able  to require &lt;br /&gt;buyers to pay   higher prices, which translate int o lowe   r y&lt;br /&gt;ields. &lt;br /&gt;I don’t fully   understand why an inverted yield curve should be a negative, but its fans  swear that it is.  &lt;br /&gt;I merely    can’t  prove that   it’s  not.   One possible ramifi&lt;br /&gt;cati  on is  the threat to bank profitability: an &lt;br /&gt;inverted yiel  d curve takes away banks’ a&lt;br /&gt;bility to make money simply by   borrowing short to lend &lt;br /&gt;long. &lt;br /&gt;Profitless success – Historically, companies have  been considered valuable primarily because they &lt;br /&gt;produce profits – if not immediately, then at least they were expected to do so in the foreseeable &lt;br /&gt;future.  Then the  view arose in the    tech-media-telecom bubble of the late  1990s that companies could &lt;br /&gt;be great   (and valuable) even in the absence of profits  for years to come.  Today, profitless companies &lt;br /&gt;are  bac k in vogue and sometimes valued in the tens of billions of doll&lt;br /&gt;ars. &lt;br /&gt;Tech     and venture investors have  made a lot  of money over the  last  ten years.  Thus there’s great &lt;br /&gt;interest in tec h companies (including ones like Uber and Lyft that   are &lt;br /&gt;applying technology to enable &lt;br /&gt;new   business    models   ) and  willingness to pay high prices today for the possibility of profits   far down &lt;br /&gt;the  road.  There’s nothing wrong with   this, as long as the possibility is real, not over-rated and &lt;br /&gt;not over-priced.  The issue for me is that in a period when profitless-ness isn’t  an impediment to &lt;br /&gt;investor affection – when projected tech-company profitability commencing years from now is&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;valued as high ly  as, or higher than, the current profits of more mundane firms – investing in these &lt;br /&gt;companies can be a b ig  mistake. &lt;br /&gt;Today there   are  a lot  of investors who weren’t around to see the 2000 bursting of the TMT   bubble, in &lt;br /&gt;which large numbers of Internet and e-commerce companies were  given the benefit    of the doubt, &lt;br /&gt;only   to end up worthless.  Venture capital funds showed triple-digit annual returns in the late 1990s, &lt;br /&gt;but the ones starte  d around 2000 performed very poorly   (and people began to as k me if venture &lt;br /&gt;capital was  a legitimate asset   class). &lt;br /&gt;Today, some tec h and venture investments have again produced great results, and the doubts  seem   to &lt;br /&gt;be gone.  In  investing, however, the truth usuall   y lies   somewhere between the extremes of &lt;br /&gt;infinite value  and worthlessness.  Investor sentiment seems to be closer to  the positive end of the &lt;br /&gt;pendulum’s  arc these days, but it’s  unlikely to stay   there in perpetuity. &lt;br /&gt;Growth investing preeminence   forever – Since future-oriented “growth investing” has   been so &lt;br /&gt;successful for so long, and has so seriously trounced “value investing,” people are asking me whether &lt;br /&gt;this will ever end.  In particular, value  investing is being  likened to the out-of-favor “cigar-butt” &lt;br /&gt;school of investing, in which people buy assets regardless of their quality just because they’re low-&lt;br /&gt;priced.  Critics of value investing argue that, since the technological leadership that’s often &lt;br /&gt;associated with growth stocks is so essential for success in today’s world, old-economy companies &lt;br /&gt;lacking it are unlikely to be  top performers in &lt;br /&gt;the  future. &lt;br /&gt;My   answer is simple: low price is very  different from good value, and those who pursue low price &lt;br /&gt;above all else can easily fall into “value traps.”  And certainly it’s true that old-economy companies &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are  less  likely    to be the fast  growers of the future or benefit as much from the “moats” that   protected &lt;br /&gt;them in the past.   &lt;br /&gt;It  may  also be true  that given the ease today of searching the univer  se  of securities, it may be harder &lt;br /&gt;than it used to be to find “value” c&lt;br /&gt;ompanies with current assets or earning powe r that   are broadly &lt;br /&gt;unrecognized and thus  underpriced.  Since the best  returns come   from buying  things whose   merits &lt;br /&gt;others aren’t aware of, it’s   certainly possible that easy, widespread access to data is making it harder &lt;br /&gt;for value investors to excel.   &lt;br /&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;n the other  hand, companies that do have better    technology, better earnings prospects and &lt;br /&gt;the ability to be disrupters rather than disrupted still aren’t worth infinity.  Thus it’s possible &lt;br /&gt;for them to become overpriced and dangerous as investments, even as they succeed as &lt;br /&gt;businesses (this was often the case with the Nifty-Fifty in 1968-73).  And I continue to believe &lt;br /&gt;th&lt;br /&gt;at eventually, after the mod&lt;br /&gt;ern   winners have been   lauded (and bid  up) to excess, there will &lt;br /&gt;come a time when companies lacking the same   advantages will  be so relatively cheap that they &lt;br /&gt;can represent better investments (see  value versus growth in 2000-02).   &lt;br /&gt;Understandably, the stocks of companies with bright futures are likely    to be outperformers in times &lt;br /&gt;of ec&lt;br /&gt;onomic growth and optimism, when investors are happy to pay up for potential.  But stocks of &lt;br /&gt;companies with tangible value in the here-and-now are likely    to hold up better in less positive   times &lt;br /&gt;because (a) they’ve previously been disrespected and valued lower and (b) the rationale underlying &lt;br /&gt;their prices is less  a matter    of c  onjecture and faith.  Thus a swing in favor of value may have  to await &lt;br /&gt;a period in which the “champions” lose some   of their luster, perhaps in a market correction (see &lt;br /&gt;4Q2018).  But it’ll   come. &lt;br /&gt;*           *            * &lt;br /&gt;What do all the theories propounded above have in common?  That’s easy: they’re optimistic.  &lt;br /&gt;Each one provides an explanation of why things should go well in the future, in ways that &lt;br /&gt;didn’t always go well in the past. &lt;br /&gt;In recent years, the U.S. has simultaneously experienced economic growth, low inflation, expanding &lt;br /&gt;deficits and debt, low interest rates and rising financial markets.  It’s important to recognize that &lt;br /&gt;these things are essentially incompatible.  They generally haven’t co-existed historically, and &lt;br /&gt;it’s not prudent to assume they will do so in the future. &lt;br /&gt;Many of the beliefs discussed above suggest we’re in a so-called “Goldilocks” environment: one &lt;br /&gt;that’s not too hot and not too cold.   &lt;br /&gt;Economic growth won’t be so strong that it brings on excessively high inflation, or so weak&lt;br /&gt;that it ends in recession.&lt;br /&gt;Inflation won’t be so low that the economy stagnates, or so high that it leads to burdensome&lt;br /&gt;increases in the cost of living and requires contractionary interest-rate increases to cool it off.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve   seen   times in the  past when people believed such an ideal    state would continue in perpetuity, but &lt;br /&gt;it has never worked out that way.  Maybe it will this time – no one can prove it  won’t until it doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– but certainly broad acceptance of such a proposition indicates that optimism prevails   in the current &lt;br /&gt;investment environment.&lt;br /&gt;We   keep an eye out for the widespread belief that   “this   time   it’s  different” because we want   to know &lt;br /&gt;if  markets are being lifted by bullishness, optimism, risk tolerance and low levels of skepticism.  &lt;br /&gt;Everything else   being equal, these things result in  asset prices that are high  relative to intrinsic &lt;br /&gt;values, and their  presence exposes us to the risk  that they’ll abate, taking asset prices down &lt;br /&gt;with them. &lt;br /&gt;In On the Couch (February 2016) I said: &lt;br /&gt;That’s one of the crazy things: in the real world, things generally fluctuate &lt;br /&gt;between “pretty good” and “not so hot.”  But in the world of investing, &lt;br /&gt;perception often swings from “flawless” to “hopeless.”  The pendulum careens &lt;br /&gt;from one extreme to the other, spending almost no time at “the happy medium” and &lt;br /&gt;rather little in the range of reasonableness.   &lt;br /&gt;Widespread attaching of “the four words” to bullish propositions suggests that the &lt;br /&gt;environment is being perceived as flawless.  When and if that swings to hopeless, the result is &lt;br /&gt;pain for investors.   &lt;br /&gt;Of course, no one can prove that the nine propositions discussed above won’t hold.  Economics and &lt;br /&gt;markets aren’t governed by immutable laws like the physical sciences, and there’s no schematic &lt;br /&gt;diagram that shows how they work.  Thus, I want as usual to make it explicit that these are the &lt;br /&gt;musings of someone who (a) isn’t an economist and (b) doesn’t claim to know exactly how economic &lt;br /&gt;and monetary mechanisms function.  But who does? &lt;br /&gt;Now, sometimes things really are different, as Templeton said.  (And in areas like technology and &lt;br /&gt;digital business models, I’d bet things will be different more than the 20% of the time Templeton &lt;br /&gt;cited.)  Certainly the world today is very different from that of the past.  As I’ve written before, 40 &lt;br /&gt;years ago it felt like the world was a stable place that was subject only to limited change in areas like &lt;br /&gt;scientific progress, fads and politics.  Today the idea of an unchanging world is out the window: &lt;br /&gt;things change every minute, and anyone who doesn’t keep up with the changes is fated to miss out.  &lt;br /&gt;Technological prowess can be essential for success, and every company or industry that lacks it is &lt;br /&gt;susceptible to being disrupted by those who possess it. &lt;br /&gt;I readily admit that, at my stage in life, I may not fully grasp the forces that will determine the future.  &lt;br /&gt;At times like this, when tech stocks are in the middle of a great run, I’m reminded of a classic book &lt;br /&gt;from my youth, The Money Game (1967).  In it, the pseudonymous Adam Smith introduced the Great &lt;br /&gt;Winfield, a veteran broker who, despite the limitations associated with having reached middle age, &lt;br /&gt;was minting money in the new tech stocks.  When asked about the source of his success, he &lt;br /&gt;introduced Smith to his traders:   &lt;br /&gt;“My boy,” said the Great Winfield over the phone, “Our trouble is that we are too &lt;br /&gt;old for this market.  The best players in this kind of a market have not passed their &lt;br /&gt;twenty-ninth birthdays.” &lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . “My solution to the current market,” the Great Winfield said.  “Kids.  This is a &lt;br /&gt;kids’ market.  This is Billy the Kid, Johnny the Kid, and Sheldon the Kid.” &lt;br /&gt;. . . “See?  See?” said the Great Winfield.  “The flow of the seasons!  Life begins &lt;br /&gt;again!  It’s marvelous!  It’s like having a son!  My boys!  My kids!” &lt;br /&gt;Of course, veteran that he was, the Great Winfield knew the truth.  Thus he went on: &lt;br /&gt;. . . “The strength of my kids is that they are too young to remember anything &lt;br /&gt;bad, and they are making so much money they feel invincible,” said the Great &lt;br /&gt;Winfield.  “Now you know and I know that one day the orchestra will stop &lt;br /&gt;playing and the wind will rattle through the broken window panes . . .” &lt;br /&gt;[Emphasis added] &lt;br /&gt;To close, I’ll return to a concept I consider indispensable for anyone hoping to succeed at investing – &lt;br /&gt;the three stages of a bull market: &lt;br /&gt;the first, when only a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get better,&lt;br /&gt;the second, when most investors realize improvement is actually underway, and&lt;br /&gt;the third, when everyone concludes that things can only get better forever.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly the few  who buy   in the   first   stage – when optimism is scarce and thus asset prices are low – &lt;br /&gt;ca n access great bargains.  But    those who buy in the last stage – out of a be lief that the news   will &lt;br /&gt;always be good – can be making a big  mistake.  The nine propositions reviewed above all &lt;br /&gt;represent variations on “things can only get better forever.”  If  they’re the ideas guidin&lt;br /&gt;g &lt;br /&gt;investors today, that should be considered worrisome. &lt;br /&gt;The  best investments often are made in times of fear a  nd desperation.  That’s rarely possible when &lt;br /&gt;investors are willing to blithely dismiss the limitations of the past  wit h the  words  “this   time it’s &lt;br /&gt;different.”  I would remind those investors of a quote usually attributed to Mark Twain: “History &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t repeat   itself, but it does rhyme.”     Of   course it’s important that investors keep   up with &lt;br /&gt;current developments and those th at will shape the future.  But it’s also essential that they not &lt;br /&gt;completely unlearn the lessons of the past. &lt;br /&gt;June 12, 2019&lt;br /&gt;2019 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients  &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: You Bet! &lt;br /&gt;As I’ve written in past memos, I have an indelible recollection of the first book I read as a Wharton &lt;br /&gt;freshman in 1963.  The book was Decisions Under Uncertainty: Drilling Decisions by Oil and Gas &lt;br /&gt;Operators by C. Jackson Grayson, Jr. (who in 1971 would take on the role of “price czar” in the&lt;br /&gt;Nixon administration’s efforts to get inflation under control).   &lt;br /&gt;The best and most lasting thing I took away from Grayson’s book – and the first thing I remember &lt;br /&gt;learning in college – was the observation that you can’t tell the quality of a decision from the &lt;br /&gt;outcome.  This revelation had a profound influence on me as a 17-year-old and represented the first &lt;br /&gt;critical building block in my understanding of how the world works.   &lt;br /&gt;As Grayson explained, you make the best decision you can based on what you know, but the success &lt;br /&gt;of your decision will be heavily influenced by (a) relevant information you may lack and (b) luck or &lt;br /&gt;randomness.  Because of these two factors, well-thought-out decisions may fail, and poor &lt;br /&gt;decisions may succeed.  While it might seem counterintuitive, the best decision-maker isn’t &lt;br /&gt;necessarily the person with the most successes, but rather the one with the best process and &lt;br /&gt;judgment.  The two can be far from the same, and especially over a small number of trials, it &lt;br /&gt;can be impossible to know who’s who.   &lt;br /&gt;By my stage in life – if not well before – one should have figured out his strengths and weaknesses &lt;br /&gt;and tilted his activities toward the former.  I’ve concluded that my strengths include the ability to: &lt;br /&gt;frame questions,&lt;br /&gt;logically organize data and weigh pros and cons,&lt;br /&gt;know what I don’t know,&lt;br /&gt;accept that future outcomes aren’t predictable,&lt;br /&gt;think about the future probabilistically, and&lt;br /&gt;make decisions incorporating all of the above (although far from always correctly).&lt;br /&gt;Also very important has been the ability to internalize Grayson’s point about decision quality (and &lt;br /&gt;thus live with my unsuccessful decisions from time to time).  This set of attributes equipped me for a &lt;br /&gt;career in investing . . . and for finding enjoyment in games of chance. &lt;br /&gt;My Life as a Gambler &lt;br /&gt;Although I’ve made reference to them in some past memos, games have played a bigger part in my &lt;br /&gt;life than you probably know.  Because of the many connections between investing and gambling, &lt;br /&gt;many of the investors I respect play blackjack, poker or backgammon.  You might enjoy learning &lt;br /&gt;about my past in this regard. &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people my age , I spent time as a chil  d playing card games like  “War” and “Old Maid” &lt;br /&gt;(there were  no videos to watch or video games to play, and my  parents    considered television a &lt;br /&gt;pernicious influence that had to be strictly rationed).  My    first   brush with “grown-up” games and &lt;br /&gt;betting involved gin rummy starting around age 12.  Hours spent playing with my three closest &lt;br /&gt;buddies e stablished a pattern for life. &lt;br /&gt;Whe  n I was  a sophomore in college (1964-65), card games at  the fraternity house took up an &lt;br /&gt;embarrassingly large   fraction of my time.  A different game occupied our afternoons each semester, &lt;br /&gt;including gin, pinochle, cribbage, hearts, &lt;br /&gt;casi  no, bi d whist, spades and tonk (many of these have &lt;br /&gt;since been relegated to the    dustbin of leisure-time history).  Most evenings were  devote  d to poker.  &lt;br /&gt;(You’re right to wonder when I s tud ied.  I a ctually can’t  remember doing much    of it that year.)  And &lt;br /&gt;when I eventually got serious about my studies as an upper-classman, I took up the commensurately &lt;br /&gt;serious game of bridge. &lt;br /&gt;The  next  big  step came in 1970-72, when I began to ski and was in&lt;br /&gt;troduced to backgammon back at &lt;br /&gt;the  lodge.  Although probably dismissed by non-game players as trivial, backgammon, like  bridge, is &lt;br /&gt;a game that requires a great   deal  of thought and one where study and pra&lt;br /&gt;ctice    can lead to a very high &lt;br /&gt;level    of skill.  More on it later. &lt;br /&gt;As you may know, I got   Citibank to move me to Los Angeles in 1980.  One of the  big ways this &lt;br /&gt;changed my life was that it le d me to meet my great friend Bruce Ne&lt;br /&gt;wberg, whose mind is  perfect    for &lt;br /&gt;handling the odds and strategies involved in games (as it is for investing).  Bruce and I have had &lt;br /&gt;thousands of hours of enjoyment playing backgammon and gin over the last 40 years.  We’re &lt;br /&gt;probably about even financially after all that time, and if not, the  winner’s   hourly rate  of pay is  in &lt;br /&gt;pennies.  All we get out of it is fun.  Our motto is, “The only  thing worse than   losing is not playing.”  &lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy visiting a casino once in a while  , and the opportunity to play blackjack.  In blackjack, &lt;br /&gt;you and the dealer are each dealt two cards.  You ca n “hit” or “stay” as you choose – take additional &lt;br /&gt;cards from the deck or decline to do so.  The dealer has no choice; he’s required to hit  (or forced to &lt;br /&gt;stay) depending on his card total.  In the end, whoever’s total is closer to 21 without going over is the &lt;br /&gt;winner.     &lt;br /&gt;Lots of people   go to casinos every year and lose money    at blackjack without knowing the first   thing &lt;br /&gt;about how to play successfully.  Instead, they count on luck and hunches and say they “just play to &lt;br /&gt;have    fun.”     But there are actions you can learn to take in blackjack – mostly regarding when to hit  or &lt;br /&gt;stay – that will improve your results.  These hav&lt;br /&gt;e bee   n codified into what’s called “basic strategy.”   &lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the key to further improving your probability of winning lies in the  fact   that, unlike &lt;br /&gt;most    games of chance, in blackjack the outcomes of future hands aren’t independent of the outcomes &lt;br /&gt;of past hands.  This is so   because in  blackjack the dealer deals several hands  in succession without &lt;br /&gt;returning the cards  that   have  been played to  the “shoe” from  which   he deals.  Thus, which cards have &lt;br /&gt;already been dealt directly determines which   cards remain to be dealt.  If you can trac&lt;br /&gt;k the   former &lt;br /&gt;through “card-counting,” you can have an idea about the latter.  But since the dealer’s shoe can &lt;br /&gt;contain six or eight 52-card decks, keeping track of the cards  playe  d in itself requires exceptional &lt;br /&gt;skill. &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Thorp wrote the definitive book on this, called Beat the Dealer.  When he won too much&lt;br /&gt;money, Ed was banned from the casinos and had to turn to “straight” pursuits.  As a result, he studied &lt;br /&gt;warrants on Japanese stocks and developed the art of arbitrage.  When I last saw Ed he was living an &lt;br /&gt;idyllic life in Newport Beach, prospering even in the absence of suits, ties or regular office hours. &lt;br /&gt;But let’s return to backgammon.  In this game, two opponents – one moving clockwise and the other &lt;br /&gt;counter-clockwise – try to bring their pieces around the board while simultaneously preventing the &lt;br /&gt;other from doing so, and then be the first to take them off the board.  Each player’s ability to move &lt;br /&gt;forward is determined by rolling a pair of dice.  It’s a total disaster if you’re ignorant of the &lt;br /&gt;probabilities governing rolls of the dice and instead rely on luck, gut instinct or what you think is &lt;br /&gt;your innate skill.  (In fact, the most important skill in backgammon consists of knowing these &lt;br /&gt;probabilities and thus what actions to take given your position.) &lt;br /&gt;More recently, through study Bruce has gotten too good for me at backgammon, so now we’re &lt;br /&gt;mostly down to gin.  In gin, each player is dealt 10 cards, and by alternatingly picking from the deck &lt;br /&gt;and discarding, you try to form them into “melds” of three or four cards of the same kind (such  &lt;br /&gt;as 9-9-9) or in a run of the same suit (such as 4-5-6-7 of spades).  As the hand goes on, you can opt to &lt;br /&gt;“knock” (if your un-melded cards add up to less than a certain number) or try to get “gin” (all 10 &lt;br /&gt;cards melded), which pays off in more points – unless your opponent knocks or gets gin first. &lt;br /&gt;An aside: when I speak to students, I often say, “For me, the thing that makes investing fascinating is &lt;br /&gt;the fact that there’s no action you can take that is sure to work, no strategy that’s always a winner.”  &lt;br /&gt;To illustrate, I go on: “It’s like gin.  Sometimes knocking is the best thing to do, and sometimes you &lt;br /&gt;should play for gin.”  And all I get are blank stares.  Few young people play cards anymore, and even &lt;br /&gt;fewer have ever heard of gin. &lt;br /&gt;Another aside.  While I don’t think they’re the result of conscious decisions, my life as a gambler has &lt;br /&gt;always exhibited two characteristics: &lt;br /&gt;First, I haven’t made a serious study of the games I play.  I feel if I want to work, I can go to&lt;br /&gt;the office.&lt;br /&gt;And second, I only play for small stakes.  Some people dream of big killings, and some like&lt;br /&gt;the frisson attached to risking large sums.  I’ve never felt that my enjoyment increased with&lt;br /&gt;the amount of money on the table.  I play for fun and to test my decision-making, not to win&lt;br /&gt;big money.  (Point of reference: back around 1990, I was visiting Ric Kayne at Lake Tahoe&lt;br /&gt;and he said, “Tonight I’m going to take you to the casino and make a man of you.  We’re&lt;br /&gt;going to play until you win or lose real money!”  So he called the casino host and asked him&lt;br /&gt;to arrange a $25,000 line of credit for me.  The host called back a few minutes later and said,&lt;br /&gt;“Sorry, Ric, I can’t justify a $25,000 line for someone whose average bet is $11.”)&lt;br /&gt;What about coming full  circle?  One of the best things I ever did was to teach my son Andrew to be a &lt;br /&gt;game player at an early   age.  I now have  a bui lt-in opponent for gin and backgammon.  There can be &lt;br /&gt;few sweeter memories than sitting on a log with him at Big Bear State Park playing War in 1992, &lt;br /&gt;when he was  five.  And it continues; my five-year-old granddaughter, Rosie, is  my  new opponent at &lt;br /&gt;War.  There’s nothing better! &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in Bets &lt;br /&gt;In a past memo, I told a story from my days as a buy-side analyst following the business equipment &lt;br /&gt;industry for First National City Bank.  In 1970, one of the bank’s portfolio managers asked me whom &lt;br /&gt;I considered to be the best brokerage-house analyst on Xerox.  “Well,” I answered, “the one who &lt;br /&gt;most agrees with me is so-and-so.” &lt;br /&gt;In other words, we tend to respect people who think like we do.  Did you ever hear someone say, “I &lt;br /&gt;think Bob’s a genius, and he thinks my views are all wrong”?  That’s something few people would &lt;br /&gt;ever say.  No, we tend to think highly of people whose opinions mirror ours. &lt;br /&gt;And that brings me to the source of the inspiration for this memo: a book called Thinking in Bets: &lt;br /&gt;Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts by Annie Duke.  (I provided a blurb&lt;br /&gt;for the dust jacket when it was published in 2018.)  Duke completed the coursework and dissertation &lt;br /&gt;for a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania but stopped short of receiving her &lt;br /&gt;degree, and for many years she was the best-known female professional poker player (with over $4 &lt;br /&gt;million of tournament winnings).  I was rereading Duke’s book while on vacation, and so many of &lt;br /&gt;her thoughts on poker and on decision-making in general agreed with mine that I became motivated &lt;br /&gt;to start on the memo you’re reading now.  Here are some excerpts that will show you why I was &lt;br /&gt;drawn to it [emphasis added]: &lt;br /&gt;Over time, those world-class poker players taught me to understand what a bet &lt;br /&gt;really is: a decision about an uncertain future. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;Thinking in bets starts   with recognizing that there are  exactly two things that &lt;br /&gt;determine how our lives turn out: the quality of our  decisions and luck.  Learning &lt;br /&gt;to recognize the difference betwee   n the two is wha&lt;br /&gt;t thinking in bets is all about. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;The  result    of each hand provides immediate feedback on how your decisions are &lt;br /&gt;faring.  But it’s a tricky kind of feedback because winning and losing are only loose &lt;br /&gt;signals of decision quality.  You can win lucky   hands and lose unlucky ones. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome.  A great   decision &lt;br /&gt;is  the result    of a good process, and that process   must include an attempt to accurately &lt;br /&gt;represent our own state of knowledge.  That state   of knowledge, in turn, is some &lt;br /&gt;variation of “I’m  not sure.” . . .  &lt;br /&gt;. . . we must   recognize that   no strategy can turn us into perfectly rational actors.  In &lt;br /&gt;addition, we can make th&lt;br /&gt;e best  possible    decisions and still not get  the  result   we want.  &lt;br /&gt;Improving decision quality is about increasing our   chances of good outcomes, &lt;br /&gt;not guaranteeing them. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;We   are discouraged [in life] from  saying “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure.”  We &lt;br /&gt;regard these expressions as vague, unhelpful and even evasive.  But getting &lt;br /&gt;comfortable with “I’m not sure”   is a vital   step in being a better decision-maker.  We &lt;br /&gt;have to make peace with not knowing. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good poker players and good decision-makers have in common is their &lt;br /&gt;comfort with the world being an uncertain and unpredictable place.  They &lt;br /&gt;understand that they can almost never know exactly how something will turn out.  &lt;br /&gt;They embrace that uncertainty and, instead of focusing on being sure, they try to &lt;br /&gt;figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that &lt;br /&gt;different outcomes will occur. . . . &lt;br /&gt;An expert in any field will have an advantage over a rookie.  But neither the veteran &lt;br /&gt;nor the rookie can be sure what the next flip will look like.  The veteran will just &lt;br /&gt;have a better guess. . . .    &lt;br /&gt;You don’t have to read far in Thinking in Bets before it becomes clear that Annie Duke shares Jack&lt;br /&gt;Grayson’s interest in decision-making under uncertainty.  Duke looked for real-world applications at &lt;br /&gt;the poker table, and Grayson in the oil patch.  But both worked on how to make decisions when &lt;br /&gt;faced with imperfect information and uncertain outcomes.  That brings me to the subject of &lt;br /&gt;investing . . . and this memo. &lt;br /&gt;Parsing the World of Gambling &lt;br /&gt;People who aren’t very familiar with games or who don’t dwell on them probably think they’re all &lt;br /&gt;variations on the same theme.  But actually there are big differences.  I want to touch on them so I &lt;br /&gt;can go on to create an effective analogy between gaming/gambling and investing.  Importantly, &lt;br /&gt;games vary in three primary dimensions: information availability, luck and skill. &lt;br /&gt;Some games (but not all) require players to deal with uncertainty.  Whether you or your opponent &lt;br /&gt;will win – or what action you should take – might hinge on information that’s not available to you, &lt;br /&gt;and about which you can make inferences or guesses at best.  Thus in some games, there’s &lt;br /&gt;important “hidden information,” and in others there isn’t.  In poker, blackjack and gin you don’t &lt;br /&gt;know what cards your opponent is holding.  But in chess and backgammon, everything’s plain to see: &lt;br /&gt;the position of the playing pieces on the board.  Nothing is hidden.  Obviously this is a big &lt;br /&gt;difference.  Where no information is hidden, the game is reduced to the other two elements.   &lt;br /&gt;After the conditions have been set (the cards have been dealt or the pieces are in their positions on &lt;br /&gt;the board), there’s another source of uncertainty.  In some games subsequent developments will be &lt;br /&gt;influenced by luck, and in some they won’t.  Take the two games I said don’t involve hidden &lt;br /&gt;information: chess and backgammon.  In chess, there’s no such thing as luck – no dice to throw or &lt;br /&gt;cards to draw; the key variable is the moves your opponent chooses to make.  (I guess there is one &lt;br /&gt;element of luck: how skillful is the opponent you’ve drawn?)   &lt;br /&gt;In backgammon, on the other hand, the moves a player gets to make are entirely determined by what &lt;br /&gt;numbers come up when he rolls the dice.  And in card games, what cards he and his opponent draw is &lt;br /&gt;subject to luck.  Sometimes these things are total unknowns – a matter of sheer randomness – and in &lt;br /&gt;others, while the outcome can’t be predicted with certainty, probabilities can be assigned.   &lt;br /&gt;In blackjack, for example, we can know something about the cards that will come out in the&lt;br /&gt;future if we can keep track of the ones that already have been played.&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in backgammon, we know with absolute certainty the probability of every possible result&lt;br /&gt;of rolling the dice: over a large number of rolls, the number seven will come up 16.7% of the&lt;br /&gt;time (six of the 36 possible outcomes on a roll of the dice), and the number twelve will come&lt;br /&gt;up only 2.8% of the time (one out of the 36).  Of course, even if we know the probabilities,&lt;br /&gt;we still don’t know which number will come up on any one roll.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in some games skill is important, and in others it isn’t.  There’s skill (albeit with varying &lt;br /&gt;degrees of difficulty) in all the games I’ve discussed so far: chess, backgammon, poker and gin.  &lt;br /&gt;Games with and without hidden information can entail skill, and games affected and unaffected by &lt;br /&gt;luck can entail skill.   &lt;br /&gt;But the role of skill isn’t universal in games/gambling.  Roulette and wheel-of-fortune are games of &lt;br /&gt;pure chance or luck.  The outcome is entirely a matter of random events that can’t be predicted at all, &lt;br /&gt;like which slot in a roulette wheel the ball will fall into when the wheel stops spinning.  And since &lt;br /&gt;there’s no ability to predict future developments, there’s no such thing as skill: only luck.   &lt;br /&gt;In the early 1980s, I used to go to Las Vegas with a now-departed friend.  He spent a lot of&lt;br /&gt;time (and money) on wheel-of-fortune, which is nothing but vertical roulette.  I used to tell&lt;br /&gt;him he was “the world’s greatest wheel-of-fortune player.”  Since he thought there actually&lt;br /&gt;was such a thing as playing the game well, he never got the joke.&lt;br /&gt;There’s a very interesting example in punto banco, a form of baccarat.  As Wikipedia says,&lt;br /&gt;“In punto banco, each player’s moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt.”  That is,&lt;br /&gt;there are no decisions to make, so clearly no such thing as skill in decision-making.  You sit&lt;br /&gt;down, place your bet, receive your cards, and either win or lose.  One version of history says&lt;br /&gt;baccarat was invented for the enjoyment of a king who wasn’t smart enough to learn to play&lt;br /&gt;games; thus one was developed that required no decisions . . . and thus entailed no skill.&lt;br /&gt;Note from the above the different types of games: &lt;br /&gt;No hidden information, no luck, skill.  (Chess)&lt;br /&gt;No hidden information, luck, skill.  (Backgammon)&lt;br /&gt;No hidden information, luck, no skill.  (Roulette)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden information, luck, skill.  (Blackjack, poker)&lt;br /&gt;Now we can drill down.  Here are some important observations:  &lt;br /&gt;Where there’s no skill involved, the outcome has to depend entirely on luck.&lt;br /&gt;But even if skill is involved, luck can still play a role.&lt;br /&gt;The presence of luck doesn’t necessarily preclude a role for skill.  In fact, making&lt;br /&gt;intelligent decisions when future events are uncertain is one of the greatest forms of&lt;br /&gt;skill.  It’s what Grayson’s and Duke’s books are all about.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the ability to deal intelligently with hidden information has to be based on&lt;br /&gt;skill.&lt;br /&gt;Creating this taxonomy, or “scheme of classification,” not only allows me a chance to educate non-&lt;br /&gt;game-players, but it also provides a framework for a comparison to investing (if you hadn’t noticed). &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Is Investing Like Gambling? &lt;br /&gt;Hidden information, luck and skill can play a part in investing.  In active investing involving public &lt;br /&gt;companies, for example, all three are involved. &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, no one knows all the relevant facts.  The SEC tries to make sure all investors have&lt;br /&gt;equal access to information, but not necessarily complete access.  For example, investors&lt;br /&gt;won’t know about first-quarter developments at a company until it reports earnings in May.&lt;br /&gt;And no one is supposed to know the results of drug trials and beta tests until they’re made&lt;br /&gt;public.&lt;br /&gt;Luck – random, unpredictable, often-exogenous events – affects companies and their stocks&lt;br /&gt;all the time.  Many aspects of corporate performance and profitability can be influenced by&lt;br /&gt;weather, for example.  And the TV network carrying the World Series is likely to enjoy much&lt;br /&gt;greater ad revenue if the teams playing come from major markets rather than small ones.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the superior investor has the skill required to better assess revenue and profit&lt;br /&gt;potential, where we stand in the cycle, the fairness of an asset’s price and the margin of&lt;br /&gt;safety it affords.  No one gets these things right all the time, but the superior investor does so&lt;br /&gt;more often than most.&lt;br /&gt;Not all investing, however, entails all – or necessarily any – of the three elements.  Take, for &lt;br /&gt;example, index investing.  The index fund manager’s job is to produce the same return as the relevant &lt;br /&gt;index. &lt;br /&gt;There’s no such thing as hidden information.  The only information the investor needs to&lt;br /&gt;succeed at his job relates to the composition of the index in question, and there’s no mystery&lt;br /&gt;in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, there’s no luck.  The forces that influence the securities in the index will have&lt;br /&gt;exactly the same influence on a properly constructed index fund.&lt;br /&gt;And finally, there’s no skill.  All it takes is a well-programmed computer to keep the fund’s&lt;br /&gt;portfolio in line with the index, and that isn’t hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;It’s worth delving into the matter of investing skill.  The efficient market hypothesis posits that (a) &lt;br /&gt;markets are “efficient,” (b) thus assets are priced fairly and there are no bargains or overpriced assets, &lt;br /&gt;and (c) as a result, there’s no scope for skill or “alpha,” defined as the ability to outperform by &lt;br /&gt;capitalizing on mispricings.  The traditional view of active investing, which ignores this hypothesis, &lt;br /&gt;is that investing is like blackjack, meaning it’s possible for some people to be better at it than others. &lt;br /&gt;But if the efficient market hypothesis is right, investing is like roulette, with investors’ returns &lt;br /&gt;beyond their control and solely a function of luck, or what the market does.  (Of course, a portfolio’s &lt;br /&gt;return can be amplified or diminished relative to the market’s return by the portfolio’s relative &lt;br /&gt;sensitivity to it: the “beta.”  And that leads to the question of whether investors have the skill to move &lt;br /&gt;beta up and down in a timely fashion.)  &lt;br /&gt;In most markets, the concept of efficiency is neither an absolute truth nor completely inapplicable.  &lt;br /&gt;Some markets may be less efficient than others; thus skill may be more relevant in some &lt;br /&gt;markets than in others.  Where skill is highly relevant, markets are called “alpha” markets.  Where &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s not – and the portfolio return is mostly a function of the market’s return and the portfolio’s &lt;br /&gt;sensitivity to market movements – they’re called “beta” markets.  Obviously it’s important to figure &lt;br /&gt;out which type of market you’re working in.  &lt;br /&gt;For years, people (whether consciously or not) treated the stock market as an “alpha” market, and &lt;br /&gt;equity portfolio managers were able to charge substantial management fees for their efforts.  But &lt;br /&gt;over time, it was increasingly observed that most active investors were incapable of consistently &lt;br /&gt;outperforming the market indices (especially after fees).  That meant skill was lacking: you could get &lt;br /&gt;the same result or better by passively emulating an index.  Investors concluded that they would no &lt;br /&gt;longer pay for alpha in a beta market, and that’s the main reason for the growth of passive investing.  &lt;br /&gt;Why pay someone to play for you in a game where there’s no such thing as skill?  &lt;br /&gt;What’s the bottom line?  In my view, the active investing I’m interested in – hopefully in &lt;br /&gt;markets that are less efficient – involves all three of the ingredients under discussion: hidden &lt;br /&gt;information, luck and skill.  Thus it’s most like poker and blackjack, not chess.  It’s in that vein &lt;br /&gt;that I’ll proceed. &lt;br /&gt;The Essence &lt;br /&gt;One of the most important aspects of skill in gambling consists of figuring out which possible &lt;br /&gt;outcome to bet on, and when to bet heavily and when not to.  This is where all facets of the decision &lt;br /&gt;come together. &lt;br /&gt;Gauging the likely outcome – How likely is one participant (you?) to win, and how likely is &lt;br /&gt;someone else?  Whether in card games, backgammon or sports betting, there are a number of factors &lt;br /&gt;to consider.  The most important are these: &lt;br /&gt;How good is your current position?&lt;br /&gt;How many paths do you have to winning (and to losing)?&lt;br /&gt;To what extent would it require good luck regarding throws of the dice or draws of the cards&lt;br /&gt;for you to win?  And what’s the probability your opponent will enjoy good-enough outcomes&lt;br /&gt;for him to be the winner instead?&lt;br /&gt;The job here is to “handicap” the outcome, defined by Merriam-Webster as “to assess the relative &lt;br /&gt;winning chances of (contestants) or the likely winner of (a contest).”  Which poker player has the &lt;br /&gt;best hand?  Who’s in the better position on the backgammon board?  Or for the bettor, which horse is &lt;br /&gt;likely to win the race, or which team is likely to win the game?  To put it simply, who’s the &lt;br /&gt;favorite?  &lt;br /&gt;Many people think figuring out who’s most likely to win is all you have to do to successfully bet &lt;br /&gt;on card games, backgammon or sports.  They’re missing a huge part of the matter, and &lt;br /&gt;perhaps the far more important part. &lt;br /&gt;Assessing the proposition – There’s usually not much mystery involved in identifying the favorite.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s pretty clear who’s ahead in backgammon.  It’s more of a challenge in card games, where players &lt;br /&gt;hold cards the others don’t know about, but still it’s possible to have a sense for how good one’s &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hand is in absolute terms.  And in most cases there’s a solid consensus around which horse or team is &lt;br /&gt;most likely to win.  &lt;br /&gt;But one of the most important things to know about gambling is that information that’s available to &lt;br /&gt;everyone isn’t likely to produce winnings.  Since most people know who the likely winner is in a &lt;br /&gt;hand of cards, a backgammon game that’s underway or a sports bet, that isn’t valuable information.  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone might like to bet on a favorite, but that means it’s unlikely they’ll be able to find &lt;br /&gt;someone to take the other side of the wager: to bet against the favorite without an inducement.  &lt;br /&gt;That inducement takes the form of a “proposition.”  Consider a football matchup in which Team &lt;br /&gt;A is considered twice as likely to win as Team B.  Stated another way, Team A is viewed as likely to &lt;br /&gt;win two times out of three, and Team B only once.  If it’s common knowledge that Team A is that &lt;br /&gt;much better, no one will bet on Team B unless the person who favors Team A is willing to “lay &lt;br /&gt;odds.”  That is, Joe might tell Ed, “I’ll give you 2-to-1 odds; I’ll bet $10 against your $5 that Team A &lt;br /&gt;will beat Team B.”  Assuming the outcomes go according to expectations, Joe wins $5 two times out &lt;br /&gt;of three and loses $10 one time.  Over three games, then, the two bettors come out even.  That means &lt;br /&gt;2-to-1 odds are “fair” in this situation.&lt;br /&gt;So here’s the bottom line: the goal isn’t to figure out who the favorite is and bet on it.  Rather, the &lt;br /&gt;goal is to figure out who the favorite is and whether the odds are fair or not.  &lt;br /&gt;If the odds are fair, as illustrated above, there’s no reason (other than sentiment) to bet on one&lt;br /&gt;team or the other.&lt;br /&gt;If the odds don’t penalize the favorite enough – let’s say the odds on the above matchup are&lt;br /&gt;only 6-to-5 – you should bet on the favorite.  Team A will win two-thirds of the time.  The&lt;br /&gt;one time out of three when they lose, the $6 you pay won’t offset the total of $10 you win on&lt;br /&gt;the two occasions when they come out ahead.&lt;br /&gt;But if the odds are tilted against the favorite – the odds are “too long,” maybe 4-to-1 – it’s&lt;br /&gt;better to bet on the underdog.  You’ll still lose $1 two times out of three (for a total of $2),&lt;br /&gt;but on the one game you win, the $4 payoff will more than compensate.&lt;br /&gt;A great example can be seen in the world of backgammon.  The player who’s ahead can offer to &lt;br /&gt;double the stakes from $5 to $10 by “turning the cube,” in which case the other player has to choose &lt;br /&gt;between surrendering for $5 or playing on for $10.  Since the leader offers to double because he’s &lt;br /&gt;ahead, does that mean it’s a mistake for the player who’s behind to accept?  Not necessarily.  &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, if the laggard surrenders, he loses $5.&lt;br /&gt;But what if, let’s say, he has a 25% chance of winning and plays on for $10?  In that case, his&lt;br /&gt;expected outcome is ($10 loss x .75) + ($10 gain x .25), which works out to the same $5 loss.&lt;br /&gt;The lesson from the above is that a player who is behind should accept a double whenever his chance &lt;br /&gt;of winning exceeds 25%, which would give him an expected loss that’s less bad than surrendering &lt;br /&gt;for $5.  Sometimes it’s a good idea to bet on an inferior position . . . even though doing so is &lt;br /&gt;expected to result in a loss most of the time.  It all depends on the proposition. &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends Matt Bensen and Corey Robinson provided an apt excerpt from a speech titled “The Art &lt;br /&gt;of Stock Picking” by Charlie Munger.  In it, Charlie compares investing with the pari-mutuel betting &lt;br /&gt;system at the racetrack, where the payoff for each horse winning is determined by how many people &lt;br /&gt;bet on it: &lt;br /&gt;If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there &lt;br /&gt;and bets and the odds change based on what’s bet. . . .  Any damn fool can see the &lt;br /&gt;horse carrying a light weight with a wonderful win rate and a good post position etc., &lt;br /&gt;etc. is way more likely to win than a horse with a terrible record and extra weight and &lt;br /&gt;so on and so on.  But if you look at the odds, the bad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the &lt;br /&gt;good horse pays 3 to 2.  Then it’s not clear which is statistically the best bet . . . &lt;br /&gt;Success in gambling doesn’t go to those who pick winners, but to those with the ability to &lt;br /&gt;identify superior propositions.  The goal is to find situations where the odds are generous to &lt;br /&gt;one side or the other, whether favorite or underdog.  In other words, a mispricing. &lt;br /&gt;It’s exactly the same in investing.  People often say to me, “XYZ is a great company with a bright &lt;br /&gt;future, so I bought the stock.”  They’re picking a favorite but ignoring the proposition.  The former &lt;br /&gt;alone isn’t enough; they should consider the latter as well.  &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, one might say that even the best venture capitalists are poor at picking winners, since a lot &lt;br /&gt;of their investments result in losses.  But the payoff on the ones that succeed is so large, it’s sufficient &lt;br /&gt;to pay for the losers many times over and make the overall effort a great success. &lt;br /&gt;While in investing we generally aren’t offered explicit odds, the attractiveness of the &lt;br /&gt;proposition is established by the price of the asset, the ratio of the potential payoff to the &lt;br /&gt;amount risked, and what we perceive to be the chance of winning versus losing. &lt;br /&gt;Superior investors may be superior because they can figure out which companies are likely to be &lt;br /&gt;winners.  But the best investors I know also have a sense – perhaps innate and instinctive – for &lt;br /&gt;situations where the proposition is too favorable relative to the underlying fundamentals.  It &lt;br /&gt;might be a company whose securities are cheap enough to more than compensate for its poor &lt;br /&gt;prospects, or one where the future is exceptionally bright, but its securities aren’t priced high enough &lt;br /&gt;to charge fully for that potential. &lt;br /&gt;In May 1968, when I showed up at First National City Bank for a summer job in the investment &lt;br /&gt;research department, the bank (and many other banks) invested primarily in the “Nifty Fifty.”  These &lt;br /&gt;were considered to be the best and fastest-growing companies in America: companies so good that &lt;br /&gt;there was “no price too high.”  And if you bought those stocks the day I arrived and held them firmly &lt;br /&gt;for five years, you lost almost all of your money . . . investing in the best companies in America.  &lt;br /&gt;All the companies were considered future winners.  Some actually were, but far from all.  (What &lt;br /&gt;happened to Kodak, Polaroid and my favorite, Simplicity Pattern?)  The proposition was wrong: they &lt;br /&gt;were priced as if they couldn’t lose, and it turned out several would. &lt;br /&gt;Then, in 1978, I switched to Citi’s bond department, and I was asked to start a high yield bond fund.  &lt;br /&gt;Now I was investing in the bonds of the worst public companies in America – all rated speculative &lt;br /&gt;grade, or “junk.”  And I was making good money safely and steadily.  Not because the companies &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;were flawless – in fact, about 4% by dollar amount would go on to default each year on average – but &lt;br /&gt;because “the price” was too favorable to those who bet on them.  &lt;br /&gt;This experience produced two of my most important observations: &lt;br /&gt;Success in investing doesn’t come from buying good things, but from buying things well,&lt;br /&gt;and it’s essential to know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It’s not a matter of what you buy, but what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;Nifty Fifty investors spent all of their time picking favorites and failed to notice that the prices they &lt;br /&gt;paid were too high.  Mostly winning companies, but poor investments. &lt;br /&gt;And because popular opinion was stacked so heavily against high yield bonds, those who invested in &lt;br /&gt;them received excessive compensation for taking the associated risk: the proposition was too good.  &lt;br /&gt;Moody’s defined a B-rated bond as one that “fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable &lt;br /&gt;investment.”  In other words, Moody’s panned those bonds because they were underdogs but never &lt;br /&gt;asked about the price.  It’s usually non-objective, too-positive or too-negative attitudes like these that &lt;br /&gt;give rise to propositions that are too good or too bad for the takers.  That’s what we should search for &lt;br /&gt;as investors. &lt;br /&gt;Guest Contributor &lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned on page three, one of the best things I ever did was to encourage my son Andrew to &lt;br /&gt;develop a love of games.  In Andrew’s case, he applied the same seriousness to games that he does to &lt;br /&gt;investing and his other pursuits.  This gave him the thought process of a gambler and enables him to &lt;br /&gt;suggest the following ways in which gambling has parallels to investing:   &lt;br /&gt;Game selection versus skill – When considering where to invest, it’s important to&lt;br /&gt;understand both how much of the requisite skill you possess and the quality of the&lt;br /&gt;competition.  Being a consistent winner among the best gamblers or in the most intensely&lt;br /&gt;competitive markets can be very difficult.  Instead, your energy might be better spent looking&lt;br /&gt;for less-efficient niches.  Unfortunately, it’s harder to find them than it was decades ago.&lt;br /&gt;Increasing efficiency/the tendency of markets to adapt – In the early days of online poker,&lt;br /&gt;it was easy for decent players to win, and a lot of amateurs were enticed to play by seeing a&lt;br /&gt;newcomer win the World Series of Poker.  After some time, however, the games became&lt;br /&gt;tougher as they attracted professional players, and the amateurs lost their money.  The new,&lt;br /&gt;more sophisticated generation of competitors learned their predecessors’ tendencies,&lt;br /&gt;improved on their strategies and started beating them.  In this way, changes in the arena and&lt;br /&gt;in participants’ behavior can cause what worked years ago to not work today.&lt;br /&gt;Circle of competence – Just because you’re great at gin rummy doesn’t mean you should&lt;br /&gt;play Texas Hold’em against a professional poker player.  It’s important to know your&lt;br /&gt;strengths and stick to them.&lt;br /&gt;Not having to play every hand – There’s no requirement to bet on every game or every&lt;br /&gt;hand.  You can wait until you get a particularly attractive proposition, one that you feel&lt;br /&gt;particularly capable of analyzing and understanding, and where the odds are on your side.  In&lt;br /&gt;the interim, it’s better to sit out and protect your bankroll.&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of not just winning and losing, but of maximizing wins and minimizing&lt;br /&gt;losses – The key is to bet big when you have a big edge and small when you have less of an&lt;br /&gt;edge . . . and to know the difference.  As Charlie Munger puts it, “The wise ones bet heavily&lt;br /&gt;when the world offers them that opportunity.  They bet big when they have the odds.  And&lt;br /&gt;the rest of the time, they don’t.  It’s just that simple.”  Everyone will have both winners and&lt;br /&gt;losers.  Various factors will determine the ratio.  But the ability to assess propositions can&lt;br /&gt;enable you to win more on your winners than you lose on your losers.  The size of your bet&lt;br /&gt;should take into account both the probability you are correct about who’s going to win and&lt;br /&gt;the asymmetry of the potential payout.  “Getting your money in” when you have a great hand&lt;br /&gt;is one of the most important keys to winning at poker.  You don’t get many great hands, so&lt;br /&gt;when you do, you have to be sure to take maximum advantage.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to make it through downturns – It’s important to have discipline when risking&lt;br /&gt;your capital, so that you can survive unfavorable periods and still be around when the&lt;br /&gt;winners show up.  You have to avoid the risk of ruin, and this requires solid discipline (you&lt;br /&gt;must “never forget the six-foot-tall man who drowned crossing the river that was five feet&lt;br /&gt;deep on average”).  To that end, good play isn’t just a function of relying on the expected&lt;br /&gt;value of your holdings and pure math, but also of thinking broadly about risk.  Would you bet&lt;br /&gt;all your money on an 80/20 favorite?&lt;br /&gt;Adjusting your play based on the environment – In poker, if your competition is weak,&lt;br /&gt;you may decide to play more hands regardless of their strength and bet more aggressively,&lt;br /&gt;while against strong players you may tighten up and only play premium hands.&lt;br /&gt;Overcoming emotion and biases – Human failings can cause gamblers to “chase” in poker&lt;br /&gt;(overstay in a hand in the hope of getting a lucky card), play loose (bet too much) when&lt;br /&gt;they’re “steaming” (smarting from losses and thus driven by heated emotion), and take bad&lt;br /&gt;doubles in backgammon.  Hope, emotion and optimism are the gambler’s enemies.&lt;br /&gt;Second-level thinking – It’s not just how good your hand is.  There’s much more.  How&lt;br /&gt;good does your opponent think your hand is?  How good do you think your opponent’s hand&lt;br /&gt;is?  How good does he think you think his is?  How is that motivating his actions?  The&lt;br /&gt;consistent winner has to be able to think at a higher, more complex level than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;All the ideas discussed above are important in investing, just as they are in gambling.  In both &lt;br /&gt;pursuits, it all comes down to Jack Grayson’s title: Decisions Under Uncertainty.  As I’ve learned in&lt;br /&gt;the 56 years since first reading his book: &lt;br /&gt;You have to be able to understand which companies or assets are favored and the&lt;br /&gt;attractiveness of the proposition.&lt;br /&gt;You need a sense for whether your holding is a good one and for the chance the competition&lt;br /&gt;–the market, which you’re playing against – might have better.&lt;br /&gt;You need the discipline to follow a process and the wisdom to accept that no process is sure&lt;br /&gt;to produce good results.&lt;br /&gt;You have to understand the significance of the information you have, as well as that which&lt;br /&gt;you don’t have.  You need the nerve to bet heavily based on what you think you know and a&lt;br /&gt;healthy respect for what you may not know.&lt;br /&gt;You need to control greed and fear, hopefulness and despondency.  You have to resist&lt;br /&gt;making an unwise bet just because it could enable you to catch up with the indices or the&lt;br /&gt;competition.&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since her book provided the impetus for this memo, I’ll let Annie Duke sum up.  She’ll be talking &lt;br /&gt;about poker, but it’ll sound a lot like investing [emphasis added]: &lt;br /&gt;When we think probabilistically, we are less likely to use adverse results alone as &lt;br /&gt;proof that we made a decision error, because we recognize the possibility that the &lt;br /&gt;decision might have been good but luck and/or incomplete information (and a sample &lt;br /&gt;size of one) intervened.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe we made the best decisions from a set of unappealing choices, none of which &lt;br /&gt;were likely to turn out well.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe we committed our resources on a long shot because the payout more than &lt;br /&gt;compensated for the risk, but the long shot didn’t come in this time.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe we made the best choice based on the available information, but decisive &lt;br /&gt;information was hidden and we could not have known about it.  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe we chose a path with very high likelihood of success and got unlucky. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;But it also means we must redefine “right.”  If we aren’t wrong just because things &lt;br /&gt;didn’t work out, then we aren’t right just because things turned out well. . . . &lt;br /&gt;First the world is a pretty random place.  The influence of luck makes it impossible to &lt;br /&gt;predict exactly how things will turn out, and all the hidden information makes it even &lt;br /&gt;worse.  If we don’t change our mindset, we’re going to have to deal with being wrong &lt;br /&gt;a lot. . . . &lt;br /&gt;Poker teaches that lesson.  A great poker player who has a good sized advantage over &lt;br /&gt;the other players at the table, making significantly better strategic decisions, will still &lt;br /&gt;be losing over 40% of the time at the end of eight hours of play.  That’s a whole lot &lt;br /&gt;of wrong.  And it’s not just confined to poker. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;How can we be sure that we are choosing the alternative that is best for us?  What if &lt;br /&gt;another alternative would bring us more happiness, satisfaction, or money?  The &lt;br /&gt;answer, of course, is we can’t be sure.  Things outside our control (luck) can &lt;br /&gt;influence the result.  The futures we imagine are merely possible.  They haven’t &lt;br /&gt;happened yet.  We can only make our best guess, given what we know and don’t &lt;br /&gt;know, at what the future will look like. . . .  When we decide, we are betting whatever &lt;br /&gt;we value . . . on one of a set of possible and uncertain futures.  That is where the &lt;br /&gt;risk is.  &lt;br /&gt;Investing is a game of skill – meaning inferior players can’t expect to be above average winners &lt;br /&gt;in the long run.  But it also includes elements of chance – meaning skill won’t win out every &lt;br /&gt;time.  In the long run, superior skill will overcome the impact of bad luck.  But in the short run, &lt;br /&gt;luck can overwhelm skill, and the two can be indistinguishable. &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things that make investing both challenging and stimulating.  They’re the reason I feel &lt;br /&gt;good about the way I chose to spend my career. &lt;br /&gt;January 13, 2020&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Uncertainty &lt;br /&gt;I wrote a memo a week for six weeks starting on March 3, but I’ve skipped the last three weeks.  &lt;br /&gt;First, the string had to end sometime.  And second, I try to adhere to the principle that if I don’t have &lt;br /&gt;anything additive to say, I don’t write.  Hopefully you’ll find this one worth reading. &lt;br /&gt;Our inability to know the future is a theme I’ve touched on repeatedly over the years, but now I’ve &lt;br /&gt;decided to devote an entire memo to it.  Being at home for nearly two months means I’ve had a lot of &lt;br /&gt;time on my hands, like everyone else.  And it’s a good thing, because getting philosophical musings &lt;br /&gt;down on paper is a lot harder than writing about current events and what to do about them.   &lt;br /&gt;And while I’m explaining myself, I’ll apologize up front for the number of citations and their length  &lt;br /&gt;–but there’s so much wisdom I want to share.&lt;br /&gt;All We Don’t Know &lt;br /&gt;As everyone knows, today we’re experiencing unprecedented (or at least highly exceptional) &lt;br /&gt;developments in four areas: the pandemic, the economic contraction, the oil price collapse and the &lt;br /&gt;Fed/government response.  Thus a number of considerations make the future particularly &lt;br /&gt;unpredictable these days: &lt;br /&gt;•The field of economics is muddled and imprecise, and there’s good reason it’s called “the&lt;br /&gt;dismal science.”  Unlike a “real” science like physics, in economics there are no rules that&lt;br /&gt;one can count on to consistently produce a given outcome, as in “if a, then b.”  There are only&lt;br /&gt;patterns that tend to repeat, and while they may be historical, logical and often-observed,&lt;br /&gt;they’re still only tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;•In some recent memos, I’ve mentioned Marc Lipsitch, Professor of Epidemiology at&lt;br /&gt;Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  In my version of his hierarchy, there are (a)&lt;br /&gt;facts, (b) logical inferences from past experience and (c) guesses.  Because of the imprecision&lt;br /&gt;of economics, there certainly are no facts about the economic future.  Economists and&lt;br /&gt;investors make inferences from past patterns, but these are unreliable at best, and I think in&lt;br /&gt;many cases their judgments fall under the heading of “guesses.”&lt;br /&gt;•These days I’m often asked questions like “Will the recovery be V-shaped, or a U, W or L?”&lt;br /&gt;and “Which of the crises you’ve lived through does this one most resemble?”  Answering&lt;br /&gt;questions like those requires a historical perspective.&lt;br /&gt;•Given the exceptional developments enumerated above, however, there’s little or no history&lt;br /&gt;that’s relevant to today.  That means we don’t have past patterns to fall back on or to&lt;br /&gt;extrapolate from.  As I’ve said, if you’ve never experienced something before, you can’t&lt;br /&gt;say you know how it’s going to turn out.&lt;br /&gt;•While unique developments like those of today make forecasting unusually difficult, the&lt;br /&gt;presence of all four elements at once probably renders it impossible.

&lt;p&gt;difficulty of understanding each of the four individually, we can’t be sure how they’ll &lt;br /&gt;interact.  For example: &lt;br /&gt;oWill the massive, multi-faceted Fed/Treasury program of loans, grants, stimulus and&lt;br /&gt;bond buying be sufficient to offset the unparalleled damage done to the economy by&lt;br /&gt;the fight against Covid-19?&lt;br /&gt;oTo what extent will reopening bring back economic activity, and to what extent will&lt;br /&gt;that cause the spread of the disease to resume, and the renewal of lock-downs?&lt;br /&gt;For investors, the future is determined by thousands of factors, such as the internal workings of &lt;br /&gt;economies, the participants’ psyches, exogenous events, governmental action, weather and other &lt;br /&gt;forms of randomness.  Thus the problem is enormously multi-variate.  Take the current situation, &lt;br /&gt;with its four major components (Covid-19, the economy, oil and the Fed), and consider just one: the &lt;br /&gt;disease.  Now think about all the questions surrounding it: &lt;br /&gt;•How many people have it, including those who are asymptomatic?&lt;br /&gt;•How likely is contact with someone who’s infected to create another case?&lt;br /&gt;•To what degree will distancing and masks deter its spread?&lt;br /&gt;•Will the cases be severe, mild or asymptomatic?  Why?&lt;br /&gt;•Will the supply of protective gear for medical personnel, hospital beds and ventilators be&lt;br /&gt;adequate?&lt;br /&gt;•Will a treatment be developed?  To what extent will it speed recovery and prevent fatalities?&lt;br /&gt;•What will the fatality rate be relative to age, gender and pre-existing conditions?  Will the&lt;br /&gt;impact of the disease on young people worsen?&lt;br /&gt;•Will people who’ve had it and recovered be immune?  Will their immunity be permanent?&lt;br /&gt;•Will the virus mutate, and will immunity cover the new forms?&lt;br /&gt;•Will it be possible to inject antibodies to prevent infection?&lt;br /&gt;•How many people have to be immune for herd immunity to effectively stop the further&lt;br /&gt;spread?&lt;br /&gt;•Will social distancing delay the achievement of herd immunity?  Is the Swedish approach&lt;br /&gt;better?&lt;br /&gt;•Will a vaccine be invented?  When?  How long will it take to produce and deliver the needed&lt;br /&gt;doses?  Where will the U.S. stand in the line to get it?&lt;br /&gt;•How many people will refuse to be vaccinated?  With what effect?&lt;br /&gt;•Will vaccination have to be renewed annually?&lt;br /&gt;•Will the virus succumb to warm weather and humidity?&lt;br /&gt;•Will the virus be with us permanently, and will it be controllable like “just another seasonal&lt;br /&gt;disease”?&lt;br /&gt;Where am I going with this?  My point is that very few people can balance all these considerations &lt;br /&gt;to figure out our collective risk.  And that’s just Covid-19.  Now think about the many questions that &lt;br /&gt;pertain to each of the three other factors.  Who can respond to this many questions, come up with &lt;br /&gt;valid answers, consider their interaction, appropriately weight the various considerations on &lt;br /&gt;the basis of their importance, and process them for a useful conclusion regarding the virus’s &lt;br /&gt;impact?  It would take an exceptional mind to deal with all these  factors simultaneously and reach a &lt;br /&gt;better conclusion than most other people.  (I believe a computer couldn’t do so either, especially &lt;br /&gt;given all the subjective decisions required in the absence of historic precedent.) &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge lies in trying to be above average in assessing the future.  Why is that so hard? &lt;br /&gt;First of all, forecasting is a competitive arena.  The argument for the difficulty of out-forecasting &lt;br /&gt;others is similar to the argument for market efficiency (and thus the limitations of active &lt;br /&gt;management).  Thousands of others are trying, too, and they’re not “empty suits.”  Many of them &lt;br /&gt;are educated, intelligent, numerate, hard-working, highly motivated and able to access vast amounts &lt;br /&gt;of data and computing power.  So by definition it shouldn’t be easy to be better than the average. &lt;br /&gt;In addition, since economics is imprecise, unscientific and inconsistent in its functioning, as &lt;br /&gt;described above, there can’t be a method or process for forecasting that works consistently.  To &lt;br /&gt;illustrate randomness, I say that if, when I graduated from business school, I was offered a huge &lt;br /&gt;budget, an army of PhDs and lavish financial incentives to predict the coin toss before each Sunday’s &lt;br /&gt;football games, I would have been a flop.  No one can succeed in predicting things that are &lt;br /&gt;heavily influenced by randomness and otherwise inconsistent. &lt;br /&gt;Now consider the possibility that reaching conclusions is especially difficult in times of stress like &lt;br /&gt;today: &lt;br /&gt;[Recent advances in neuroscience] suggest that   we are no more than “inference &lt;br /&gt;machines” with various degrees of sophistication in how we explain our thoughts.  In &lt;br /&gt;other words, we use a lot of pattern-driven guesswork as we go about our dail y lives &lt;br /&gt;or to fill    in the gaps in an incomplete narrative.   &lt;br /&gt;This   is especially true in times of stress, as many of the mental    processes that   govern &lt;br /&gt;our reactions are  associated with an urgent search for patterns to determine our &lt;br /&gt;moves.  That is our snap  reaction in economic or financial crises    and why we &lt;br /&gt;cling to our repertoire of charts of V, U or L-shapes of recovery, among many. &lt;br /&gt;But, in very dislocated environments, we find serious limitations to this approach. &lt;br /&gt;Looking at the current environment, with disruptions to supply, demand, health and &lt;br /&gt;liquidity tensions, we could build an ensemble of the Spanish flu, the Fukushima &lt;br /&gt;earthquake and components of the 2008 crisis, for example.  But   given the very &lt;br /&gt;specific contexts of each event, we may run into endless combinations of the lessons &lt;br /&gt;learnt from  these   events.   &lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact  , in a side-by-side    comparison  of many economic forecasts, &lt;br /&gt;even   similar assumptions drive  very different outcomes on how this crisis   will &lt;br /&gt;play out.  This   may be a c ase  of the “Anna Karenina principle” coined by Professor &lt;br /&gt;Yossi Sheffi    at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Paraphrasing Tolstoy, while &lt;br /&gt;happy economies are  all  alike, every unhappy economy is unhappy in its own way.   &lt;br /&gt;We   can’t   assume that   the response to public health or financial interventions will  be &lt;br /&gt;similar across vastly different contexts.  The   root cause    of this  mistake is to look at &lt;br /&gt;average responses from  past   events   .  But    the  reality is not like that.  (Juan-Luis &lt;br /&gt;Perez   , head of research, Evidence Lab and Analytics, at UBS, the Financial Times, &lt;br /&gt;April 22, emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forecasting is difficult for a large number of reasons, including our limited understanding &lt;br /&gt;of the processes that will produce the future, their imprecise nature, the lack of historical &lt;br /&gt;precedent, the unpredictability of people’s behavior and the role of randomness, and these &lt;br /&gt;difficulties are exacerbated by today’s unusual circumstances.  &lt;br /&gt;Senior economics consultant Neil Irwin put it together very well in The New York Times on&lt;br /&gt;April 16: &lt;br /&gt;The world economy is an infinitely complicated web of interconnections.  We each &lt;br /&gt;have a series of direct economic interrelationships we can see: the stores we buy &lt;br /&gt;from, the employer that pays our salary, the bank that gives us a home loan.  But once &lt;br /&gt;you get two or three levels out, it’s really impossible to know with any confidence &lt;br /&gt;how those connections work. &lt;br /&gt;And that, in turn, shows what is unnerving about the economic calamity &lt;br /&gt;accompanying the spread of the novel coronavirus. &lt;br /&gt;In the years ahead we will learn what happens when that web is torn apart, when &lt;br /&gt;millions of those links are destroyed all at once.  And it opens the possibility of a &lt;br /&gt;global economy completely different from the one that has prevailed in recent &lt;br /&gt;decades.   &lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t agree more with what Irwin says.  Or, to use one of my all-time favorite quotes, from John &lt;br /&gt;Kenneth Galbraith: &lt;br /&gt;We have two classes of forecasters: Those who don’t know – and those who don’t &lt;br /&gt;know they don’t know.  &lt;br /&gt;While I’m in the subject of favorite quotes, I’ll take advantage of the occasion to share some others &lt;br /&gt;on this subject that I’ve stored up over the years (I think the first one may be the greatest ever): &lt;br /&gt;No amount of sophistication is going to allay the fact that all of your knowledge &lt;br /&gt;is about the past and all your decisions are about the future.  &lt;br /&gt;Ian Wilson (former GE executive) &lt;br /&gt;Those who have knowledge don’t predict; those who predict don’t have knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;Lao Tzu &lt;br /&gt;People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes, and the &lt;br /&gt;most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome. &lt;br /&gt;George Orwell &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasts create the mirage that the future is knowable.  &lt;br /&gt;Peter Bernstein &lt;br /&gt;I never think of the future – it comes soon enough. &lt;br /&gt;Albert Einstein &lt;br /&gt;The future you shall know when it has come; before then forget it. &lt;br /&gt;Aeschylus &lt;br /&gt;Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future. &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett &lt;br /&gt;I think you get the point.  I seem to be in good company in my belief that the future is unknowable. &lt;br /&gt;Having made that assertion, I’ll admit that it’s an extreme oversimplification and not entirely &lt;br /&gt;correct.  There actually are things we know about the macro future.  The trouble is that, &lt;br /&gt;mostly, they’re things everyone knows.  Examples include the fact that U.S. GDP grows about 2% &lt;br /&gt;per year on average; heating oil consumption increases in winter; and a great deal of shopping is &lt;br /&gt;moving on-line.  But since everyone knows these things, they’re unlikely to be much help in the &lt;br /&gt;pursuit of above average returns.  As I’ve described before, the things most people expect to happen &lt;br /&gt;–consensus forecasts – are by definition incorporated into asset prices at any point in time.  Since the&lt;br /&gt;future is usually a lot like the past, most forecasts – and especially macro forecasts – are&lt;br /&gt;extrapolations of recent trends and current levels, and they’re built into prices.  Since extrapolation is&lt;br /&gt;appropriate most of the time, most people’s forecasts are roughly correct.  But because they’re&lt;br /&gt;already reflected in security prices, most extrapolations aren’t a source of above average returns.&lt;br /&gt;The forecasts that produce great profits are the ones that presciently foresee radical deviations from &lt;br /&gt;the past.  But that kind of forecast is, first, very hard to make and, second, rarely right.  Thus most &lt;br /&gt;forecasts of deviation from trend also aren’t a source of above average returns. &lt;br /&gt;So let me recap: (a) only correct forecasts of a very different future are valuable, (b) it’s hard to make &lt;br /&gt;forecasts like that, (c) such unconventional predictions are rarely right, (d) thus it’s hard to be an &lt;br /&gt;above average forecaster, and (e) it’s only above average forecasts that lead to above average returns. &lt;br /&gt;So there’s a conundrum: &lt;br /&gt;•Investing is the art of positioning capital so as to profit from future developments.&lt;br /&gt;•Most professional investors strive for above average returns (i.e., they want to beat the&lt;br /&gt;market and earn their fees).&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•However, according to the above logic, macro forecasts shouldn’t be expected to lead to&lt;br /&gt;above average returns.&lt;br /&gt;•Yet very few people are content to invest while practicing agnosticism with regard to the&lt;br /&gt;macro future.  They may on some level understand the difficulty entailed in forecasting, but&lt;br /&gt;their reluctance to admit their ignorance of the future (especially to themselves) usually&lt;br /&gt;overcomes that understanding with ease.&lt;br /&gt;•And so they keep trying to predict future events – and the investment industry produces a&lt;br /&gt;large volume of forecasts.&lt;br /&gt;As I’ve expressed in recent memos, I feel the process through which most of us arrive at our &lt;br /&gt;view of the future is highly reflective of our biases.  Given the unusually wide chasm between the &lt;br /&gt;optimistic and pessimistic cases at this time – and the impossibility of choosing between them based &lt;br /&gt;on facts and historical precedents (since there are none) – I continue to think about the role of bias.  &lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest mistakes an investor can make is ignoring or denying his or her biases.  If there &lt;br /&gt;are influences that make our processes less than objective, we should face up to this fact in order to &lt;br /&gt;avoid being held captive by them. &lt;br /&gt;Our biases may be insidious, but they are highly influential.  When I read articles about how difficult &lt;br /&gt;it will be to provide adequate testing for Covid-19 or to get support to small businesses, I’m pleased &lt;br /&gt;to see my wary views reinforced, and I find it easy to incorporate those things into my thinking.  But &lt;br /&gt;when I hear about the benefits of reopening the economy or the possibility of herd immunity, I find it &lt;br /&gt;just as easy to come up with counter-arguments that leave my concerns undented.  This is a clear &lt;br /&gt;example of “confirmation bias” at work: &lt;br /&gt;Once we have formed a view, we embrace information that confirms that view while &lt;br /&gt;ignoring, or rejecting, information that casts doubt on it.  Confirmation bias suggests &lt;br /&gt;that we don’t perceive circumstances objectively.  We pick out those bits of data that &lt;br /&gt;make us feel good because they confirm our prejudices.  Thus, we may become &lt;br /&gt;prisoners of our assumptions.  (Shahram Heshmat, Psychology Today, April 23,&lt;br /&gt;2015) &lt;br /&gt;As Paul Simon wrote 50 years ago for the song The Boxer, “. . . a man hears what he wants to hear and&lt;br /&gt;disregards the rest.” &lt;br /&gt;While I didn’t know the name for it, I’ve long been aware of my bias.  In a recent memo, I told the &lt;br /&gt;story from 50 years ago, when I was Citibank’s office equipment analyst, of being asked who the &lt;br /&gt;best sell-side analyst on Xerox was.  My answer was simple: “The one who agrees with me most is &lt;br /&gt;so-and-so.”  Most people are unlikely to think highly of anyone whose views they oppose.  So when &lt;br /&gt;we think about which economists we quote, which investors we respect, and where we get our &lt;br /&gt;information, it’s likely that their  views will parallel ours.   &lt;br /&gt;Of course, taken to an extreme, this has resulted in the unfortunate, polarized state in which we find &lt;br /&gt;the U.S. today.  News organizations realized decades ago that people would rather consume stories &lt;br /&gt;that confirm their views than those that challenge them (or are dully neutral).  Few people follow &lt;br /&gt;media outlets that reflect a diversity of opinion.  Most people stick to one newspaper, cable news &lt;br /&gt;channel or political website.  And few of those fairly present both sides of the story.  Thus most &lt;br /&gt;people hear a version of the news that is totally unlike the one heard by those on the other side of the &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;debate.  When all the facts and opinions you hear confirm your own beliefs, mental life is very &lt;br /&gt;relaxed but not very enriching. &lt;br /&gt;What’s the ideal?  A calm, open mind and an objective process.  Wouldn’t we all be better off if &lt;br /&gt;those things were universal? &lt;br /&gt;In Praise of Doubt &lt;br /&gt;Another favorite theme of mine – and I’m mildly apologetic for its repetition in these memos – is &lt;br /&gt;how important it is to acknowledge what we don’t know.   &lt;br /&gt;First of all, if we’re going to out-invest the rest, we need a game plan.  There are a lot of possible &lt;br /&gt;routes to success on which to base your process: in-depth research into companies, industries and &lt;br /&gt;securities; arbitrage; algorithmic investing; factor investing; even indexation.  But if I’m right about &lt;br /&gt;the difficulty of macro forecasting, for most people that shouldn’t be it. &lt;br /&gt;Second, and probably more importantly, excessive trust in forecasting can be dangerous to your &lt;br /&gt;financial health.  It’s never been put better than in the quote that’s often attributed to Mark Twain, &lt;br /&gt;but also to several others:  &lt;br /&gt;It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.  It’s what you know for &lt;br /&gt;sure that just ain’t so. &lt;br /&gt;Just a few words, but a great deal of wisdom.  No statement that starts with “I don’t know but . . .” or &lt;br /&gt;“I could be wrong but . . .” ever got anyone into big trouble.  If we admit to uncertainty, we’ll &lt;br /&gt;investigate before we invest, double-check our conclusions and proceed with caution.  We may sub-&lt;br /&gt;optimize when times are good, but we’re unlikely to flame out or melt down.  On the other hand, &lt;br /&gt;people who are sure may dispense with those things, and if they’re sure and wrong, as the &lt;br /&gt;quote suggests, the outcome can be catastrophic. &lt;br /&gt;Investing is challenging in this way, as in so many others.  Active investors have to be confident.  &lt;br /&gt;Yale’s David Swensen said it as well as it can be said (that’s why I go back to this quote so often in &lt;br /&gt;my memos and books): &lt;br /&gt;Establishing and maintaining an unconventional investment profile requires &lt;br /&gt;acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which frequently appear &lt;br /&gt;downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom.  (Pioneering Portfolio &lt;br /&gt;Management)&lt;br /&gt;To do better than most, you have to depart from the crowd.  As I said in my April 6 memo &lt;br /&gt;Calibrating, echoing Swensen, all great investments begin in discomfort, since the things everyone &lt;br /&gt;like s and feels good about ar e unlikely to be on the bargai  n counter.  But to inves   t in thi  ngs that are &lt;br /&gt;out of f  avor – at the risk of standing out from the crow d and appearing to have ma de a big mista   ke – &lt;br /&gt;take s confi&lt;br /&gt;denc  e and resolve.  It als o requires confidence to hold onto a position when it decline  s – &lt;br /&gt;and perha  ps add t&lt;br /&gt;o it at lowe  r pr ice s – in t  he period before one’s  wis  dom become   s clea r and it turns &lt;br /&gt;into a winner.  And it take s confidence to continue holding a highly appreciated investment you think &lt;br /&gt;still has upside potential, at the risk of possibly giving up some of the gains to date.   &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when does reason-based confidence turn into hubris and obstinateness?  That’s the key &lt;br /&gt;question.  Holding and adding to declining positions is only a good idea if the underlying thesis turns &lt;br /&gt;out to be right and things eventually go as expected.  In other words, when do you allow for the &lt;br /&gt;possibility that you’re wrong?   &lt;br /&gt;From the very beginning of my investing career, I’ve felt a sense of uncertainty.  But I don’t think &lt;br /&gt;that’s a bad thing: &lt;br /&gt;•“Investing scared” – a less glamorous term than “applying appropriate risk aversion” – will&lt;br /&gt;push you to do thorough due diligence, employ conservative assumptions, insist on an ample&lt;br /&gt;margin of safety in case things go wrong, and invest only when the potential return is at least&lt;br /&gt;commensurate with the risk.  In fact, I think worry sharpens your focus.  Investing scared&lt;br /&gt;will result in making fewer mistakes (although perhaps at the price of failing to take&lt;br /&gt;maximum advantage of bull markets).&lt;br /&gt;•When I started investing in high yield bonds in 1978, and when Bruce Karsh and I first&lt;br /&gt;targeted distressed debt in 1988, it seemed clear that the route to long-term success in such&lt;br /&gt;uncertain areas lay in limiting losses rather than targeting maximum gains.  That approach&lt;br /&gt;has permitted us to still be here, while many one-time competitors no longer are.&lt;br /&gt;•I can tell you that in the Global Financial Crisis, following the bankruptcy of Lehman&lt;br /&gt;Brothers, we felt enormous uncertainty.  If you didn’t, there was something wrong with you,&lt;br /&gt;since there was a meaningful possibility the financial system would collapse.  When we&lt;br /&gt;started buying, Bruce came to me often saying, “I think we’re going too slow,” and then the&lt;br /&gt;next day, “I think we’re going too fast.”  But that didn’t keep him from investing an average&lt;br /&gt;of $450 million per week over the last 15 weeks of 2008.  I think Bruce’s ability to grapple&lt;br /&gt;with his doubts helped him arrive at the right pace of investment.&lt;br /&gt;The topic of dealing with what you don’t know brings me to a phrase I came across a few years ago &lt;br /&gt;and think is very important: intellectual humility. &lt;br /&gt;Here’s part of the article that first brought it to my attention: &lt;br /&gt;“Intellectual humility” has been something of a wallflower among personality traits, &lt;br /&gt;receiving far less scholarly attention than such brash qualities as egotism or hostility. &lt;br /&gt;Yet this little-studied characteristic may influence people’s decision-making abilities &lt;br /&gt;in politics, health and other arenas, says new research from Duke University. . . . &lt;br /&gt;As defined by the authors, intellectual humility is the opposite of intellectual &lt;br /&gt;arrogance or conceit.  In common parlance, it resembles open-mindedness.  &lt;br /&gt;Intellectually humble people can have strong beliefs, but recognize their &lt;br /&gt;fallibility and are willing to be proven wrong on matters large and small, Leary &lt;br /&gt;said.  (Alison Jones, Duke Today, March 17, 2017, emphasis added)&lt;br /&gt;To get a little more technical, here are a couple of useful paragraphs from a discussion of the &lt;br /&gt;paper cited above: &lt;br /&gt;The  term, intellectual humility (IH), has been defined in several ways, but most &lt;br /&gt;definitions converge on the notion that IH involves recognizing that one’s beliefs and &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;opinions might be incorrect. . . .  Some definitions of IH include other features or &lt;br /&gt;characteristics – such as low defensiveness, appreciating other people’s intellectual &lt;br /&gt;strengths, or a prosocial orientation . . .  &lt;br /&gt;One conceptualization defines intellectual humility as recognizing that a &lt;br /&gt;particular personal belief may be fallible, accompanied by an appropriate &lt;br /&gt;attentiveness to limitations in the evidentiary basis of that belief and to one's &lt;br /&gt;own limitations in obtaining and evaluating relevant information.  This definition &lt;br /&gt;qualifies the core characteristic (recognizing that one’s belief may be wrong) with &lt;br /&gt;considerations that distinguish IH from mere lack of confidence in one’s knowledge &lt;br /&gt;or understanding.  IH can be distinguished from uncertainty or low self-confidence by &lt;br /&gt;the degree to which people hold their beliefs tentatively specifically because they are &lt;br /&gt;aware that the evidence on which those beliefs are based could be limited or flawed, &lt;br /&gt;that they might lack relevant information, or that they may not have the expertise or &lt;br /&gt;ability to understand and evaluate the evidence.  (The Psychology of Intellectual &lt;br /&gt;Humility, Mark Leary, Duke University, emphasis added)&lt;br /&gt;“Attentiveness to limitations in the evidentiary basis” (or to the limitations imposed by future &lt;br /&gt;uncertainty) is a very important further concept.  Here’s how I discussed it in my book Mastering the &lt;br /&gt;Market Cycle:&lt;br /&gt;Most people think the way to deal with the future is by formulating an opinion as to &lt;br /&gt;what’s going to happen, perhaps via a probability distribution.  I think there are &lt;br /&gt;actually two requirements, not one.  In addition to an opinion regarding what’s going &lt;br /&gt;to happen, people should have a view on the likelihood that their opinion will prove &lt;br /&gt;correct.  Some events can be predicted with substantial confidence (e.g., will a given &lt;br /&gt;investment grade bond pay the interest it promises?), some are uncertain (will &lt;br /&gt;Amazon still be the leader in online retailing in ten years?) and some are entirely &lt;br /&gt;unpredictable (will the stock market go up or down next month?)  It’s my point here &lt;br /&gt;that not all predictions should be treated as equally likely to be correct, and thus they &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t be relied on equally.  I don’t think most people are as aware of this as they &lt;br /&gt;should be. &lt;br /&gt;In short, we have to have a realistic view of the probability that we’re right before we choose a &lt;br /&gt;course of action and decide how heavily to bet on it.  And anyone who’s sure about what’s going to &lt;br /&gt;happen in the world, the economy or the markets is probably deceiving himself.  &lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to dealing with uncertainty.  To me, that starts with acknowledging uncertainty and &lt;br /&gt;having an appropriate degree of respect for it.  As I quoted Annie Duke this past January, in my &lt;br /&gt;memo You Bet!:&lt;br /&gt;What good poker players and good decision-makers have in common is their comfort &lt;br /&gt;with the world being an uncertain and unpredictable place.  They understand that they &lt;br /&gt;can almost never know exactly how something will turn out.  They embrace that &lt;br /&gt;uncertainty and, instead of focusing on being sure, they try to figure out how unsure&lt;br /&gt;they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur.  &lt;br /&gt;(Thinking in Bets)&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, intellectual humility means saying “I’m not sure,” “The other person could be &lt;br /&gt;right,” or even “I might be wrong.”  I think it’s an essential trait for investors; I know it is in &lt;br /&gt;the people I like to associate with. &lt;br /&gt;As so often happens when I’m thinking about a memo, I recently got an incredibly helpful note from &lt;br /&gt;my friend Leslie Lichtenstein at the University of Chicago, connecting the concept of humility to the &lt;br /&gt;current episode.  Here’s what she wrote: &lt;br /&gt;This morning I read an article from Behavioral Scientist by Erik Angner [professor of&lt;br /&gt;practical philosophy at Stockholm University] called “Epistemic Humility – Knowing &lt;br /&gt;Your Limits in a Pandemic,” which made me think of you and several of your recent &lt;br /&gt;memos.  The article opens with a quote from Charles Darwin in 1871 – “Ignorance&lt;br /&gt;more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”  It goes on to say, &lt;br /&gt;“Being a true expert involves not only knowing stuff about the world but also &lt;br /&gt;knowing the limits of your knowledge and expertise.”  (Emphasis in Leslie’s note) &lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t agree more.  People who are always sure are no more helpful than people who are never &lt;br /&gt;sure.  The real expert’s confidence is reason-based and proportional to the weight of the evidence.  &lt;br /&gt;Leslie’s note sent me to the original of the article she cited, and I found so much to share: &lt;br /&gt;In the middle    of a pandemic, knowledge is in short supply.  We   don’t know how &lt;br /&gt;many people are  infected, or how many people will  be.  We   have much to learn about &lt;br /&gt;how to treat the people   who are sick – and how to help prevent infection in those who &lt;br /&gt;aren’t.  There’s reasonable disagreement on the best  policies    to pursue, whether about &lt;br /&gt;health care, economics, or supply distribution.  Although scientists worldwide are &lt;br /&gt;working hard and in concert to address these   questions, final answers are some ways &lt;br /&gt;away. &lt;br /&gt;Another thing that’s in short supply is the realization of how little   we know.  . . . &lt;br /&gt;F&lt;br /&gt;requent expressions of supreme confidence might  seem odd in light of our obvious &lt;br /&gt;and inevitable ignorance about a new threat   .  The   thing about overconfidence, &lt;br /&gt;though, is that   it afflicts most   of us much of the time  .  That’s according to cognitive &lt;br /&gt;psychologists, who’ve studied the phenomenon systematically for half  a century.  &lt;br /&gt;Overconfidence has been called “the mother of a  ll  psychological biases.    . . .”     &lt;br /&gt;The  point is not that   true  experts should withhold their beliefs   or that   they should &lt;br /&gt;never speak with conviction.  Some beliefs   are  better   supported by the evi&lt;br /&gt;dence than &lt;br /&gt;others, after all, and we should not hesitate to say so.  The   point is that   true  experts &lt;br /&gt;express themselves with the proper    degree   of confidence – meaning with a degree   of &lt;br /&gt;confidence that’s justified given the evidence. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;[Compare what you hear on TV against a tweet from medical statistician Robert &lt;br /&gt;Grant]: “I’ve studied this stuff at university, done data analysis for decades, written &lt;br /&gt;several NHS guidelines (including one for an infectious disease), and taught it to &lt;br /&gt;health professionals.  That’s why you don’t see me making any coronavirus &lt;br /&gt;forecasts. . . .” &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of epistemic humility is . . . an intellectual virtue.  It is grounded in the &lt;br /&gt;realization that our knowledge is always provisional and incomplete – and that it &lt;br /&gt;might require revision in light of new evidence.  Grant appreciates the extent of our &lt;br /&gt;ignorance under these difficult conditions; the other characters don’t.  A lack of &lt;br /&gt;epistemic humility is a vice – and it can cause massive damage both in our private &lt;br /&gt;lives and in public policy. &lt;br /&gt;Calibrating your confidence can be tricky.  As Justin Kruger and David Dunning &lt;br /&gt;have emphasized, our cognitive and metacognitive skills are intertwined.  People who &lt;br /&gt;lack the cognitive skills required to perform a task typically also lack the &lt;br /&gt;metacognitive skills required to assess their performance.  Incompetent people are &lt;br /&gt;at a double disadvantage, since they are not only incompetent but also likely &lt;br /&gt;unaware of it [Galbraith’s forecasters “who don’t know they don’t know”!].  &lt;br /&gt;This has immediate implications for amateur epidemiologists.  If you don’t have the &lt;br /&gt;skill set required to do advanced epidemiological modeling yourself, you should &lt;br /&gt;assume that you can’t tell good models from bad. &lt;br /&gt;. . . it’s never been more important to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff – the &lt;br /&gt;experts who offer well-sourced information from the charlatans who offer little but &lt;br /&gt;misdirection.  The latter are sadly common, in part because they are in greater &lt;br /&gt;demand on TV and in politics.  It can be hard to tell who’s who.  But paying attention &lt;br /&gt;to their confidence offers a clue.  People who express themselves with extreme &lt;br /&gt;confidence without having access to relevant information and the experience and&lt;br /&gt;training required to process it can safely be classified among the charlatans until &lt;br /&gt;further notice. . . . &lt;br /&gt;Again, it is fine and good to have opinions, and to express them in public – even with &lt;br /&gt;great conviction.  The point is that true experts, unlike charlatans, express &lt;br /&gt;themselves in a way that mirrors their limitations.  All of us who want to be taken &lt;br /&gt;seriously would do well to demonstrate the virtue of epistemic humility.  (Erik &lt;br /&gt;Angner, Behavioral Scientist, April 13, emphasis added)&lt;br /&gt;The more I think about it, the bottom line is clear: &lt;br /&gt;•The world is an uncertain place.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s more uncertain today than at any other time in our lifetimes.&lt;br /&gt;•Few people know what the future holds much better than others.&lt;br /&gt;•And yet investing deals entirely with the future, meaning investors can’t avoid&lt;br /&gt;making decisions about it.&lt;br /&gt;•Confidence is indispensable in investing, but too much of it can be lethal.&lt;br /&gt;•The bigger the topic (world, economy, markets, currencies and rates), the less&lt;br /&gt;possible it is to achieve superior knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;•Even our decisions about smaller things (companies, industries and securities)&lt;br /&gt;have to be conditioned on assumptions regarding the bigger things, so they, too,&lt;br /&gt;are uncertain.&lt;br /&gt;•The ability to deal intelligently with uncertainty is one of the most important skills.&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•In doing so, we should understand the limitations on our foresight and whether a&lt;br /&gt;given forecast is more or less dependable than most.&lt;br /&gt;•Anyone who fails to do so is probably riding for a fall.&lt;br /&gt;As Neil Irwin wrote in the article cited on page 4: &lt;br /&gt;It would be foolish, amid such uncertainty, to make overly confident predictions &lt;br /&gt;about how the world economic order will look in five years, or even five months.  &lt;br /&gt;Or maybe Voltaire said it best 250 years ago: Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is &lt;br /&gt;absurd. &lt;br /&gt;May 11, 2020&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Uncertainty II &lt;br /&gt;I’ve  written a few  times    about the frequency with which I come   across something additive just   before &lt;br /&gt;finalizing a memo.  This time I wasn’t so lucky: my wife Nancy brought an important article to my &lt;br /&gt;attention two weeks after the publication of Uncertainty.  The article’s appearance, along with a &lt;br /&gt;sec ond potential addition, prompts me to write this post-script to that memo.  I have a f ew  thoughts &lt;br /&gt;to add, all generally related to the topic   of foreknowledge. &lt;br /&gt;No One Knows What’s    Going to Happen &lt;br /&gt;The  above heading was   the title of an excellent article by Mark Lilla, a professor of humanities at &lt;br /&gt;Columbia University, which appeared in The  New  York  Times    this   past  Sunday.  (You may remember &lt;br /&gt;my previous discussion of our tendency to think highly of people   who agree with us.  I r eadily admit &lt;br /&gt;that the reason I like this article so much may lie in the   fact   that   it confirms a great   deal  of what   I said &lt;br /&gt;in Uncertainty.)  Here are  some   excerpts from  that   article:&lt;br /&gt;The best prophet, Thomas Hobbes once wrote, is the best guesser.  That would &lt;br /&gt;seem to be the last word on our capacity to predict the future: We can’t. &lt;br /&gt;But it is a truth humans have never been able to accept.  People facing immediate &lt;br /&gt;danger want to hear an authoritative voice they can draw assurance from; they want &lt;br /&gt;to be told what will occur, how they should prepare, and that all will be well.  We are &lt;br /&gt;not well designed, it seems, to live in uncertainty.  Rousseau exaggerated only &lt;br /&gt;slightly when he said that when things are truly important, we prefer to be &lt;br /&gt;wrong than to believe nothing at all. . . . &lt;br /&gt;Apart from the actual biology of the coronavirus – which we are only beginning &lt;br /&gt;to understand – nothing is predestined.  How many people fall ill with it depends &lt;br /&gt;on how they behave, how we test them, how we treat them and how lucky we are &lt;br /&gt;in developing a vaccine. &lt;br /&gt;The result of those decisions will then limit the choices about reopening that &lt;br /&gt;employers, mayors, university presidents and sports club owners are facing.  Their &lt;br /&gt;decisions will then feed back into our own decisions, including whom we choose for &lt;br /&gt;president this November.  And the results of that election will have the largest impact &lt;br /&gt;on what the next four years will hold. &lt;br /&gt;The pandemic has brought home just how great a responsibility we bear toward the &lt;br /&gt;future, and also how inadequate our knowledge is for making wise decisions and &lt;br /&gt;anticipating consequences.  Perhaps that is why our prophets and augurs can’t keep &lt;br /&gt;up with the demand for foresight. &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some level, people must be thinking that the more they learn about what is &lt;br /&gt;predetermined, the more control they will have.  This is an illusion.  Human beings &lt;br /&gt;want to feel that they are on a power walk into the future, when in fact we are &lt;br /&gt;always just tapping our canes on the pavement in the fog. &lt;br /&gt;A dose of humility would do us good in the present moment.  It might also help &lt;br /&gt;reconcile us to the radical uncertainty in which we are always living.  Let us retire our &lt;br /&gt;prophets and augurs.  [Emphasis added] &lt;br /&gt;Lilla’s article pulls together in one place several themes from Uncertainty and other recent memos:&lt;br /&gt;•the very human hunger for forecasts to help us navigate the future,&lt;br /&gt;•the conditionality of the future on multiple future developments,&lt;br /&gt;•our own ability to influence the future through the decisions we make,&lt;br /&gt;•the unpredictability of each development,&lt;br /&gt;•thus the futility of forecasting,&lt;br /&gt;•the importance of accepting our ignorance of the future, and thus&lt;br /&gt;•the general importance of intellectual humility.&lt;br /&gt;Articles like this one and those cited in my last memo should drive home these points to everyone’s &lt;br /&gt;satisfaction.  But rarely will people fully accept that we must make decisions regarding the &lt;br /&gt;future without knowing it. &lt;br /&gt;The Future as Path-Dependent &lt;br /&gt;Forecasters seem to act as if the future already exists, and all we have to do is be smart enough to &lt;br /&gt;discern it.  But that ignores the fact that all of us – and many other influences – are constantly &lt;br /&gt;creating the future through our collective activity.  &lt;br /&gt;In his article, Lilla stated, “. . . the post-Covid future doesn’t exist.  It will exist only after we have &lt;br /&gt;made it.”  I think this is a very important concept.  We might predict the future today, and we might &lt;br /&gt;even correctly assess what today’s conditions and actions are likely to produce in the future.  But that &lt;br /&gt;prediction will be shown to have been right only if no one and nothing causes the future to become &lt;br /&gt;different between now and the day it arrives.  Thus I’ll repeat what I quoted from Lilla earlier: &lt;br /&gt;How many people fall ill with [the coronavirus] depends on how they behave, how &lt;br /&gt;we test them, how we treat them and how lucky we are in developing a vaccine. &lt;br /&gt;Not only how will the virus behave, morph, travel, react to warm weather and infect, but also how &lt;br /&gt;fast will we reopen the economy, how will people behave when we reopen it, and what will the virus &lt;br /&gt;do at that time?  Thomas Sowell, a Hoover Institution economist and social theorist, provided a &lt;br /&gt;glimpse at how these things work in another field: &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists are often asked to predict what the economy is going to do.  But &lt;br /&gt;economic predictions require predicting what politicians are going to do – and &lt;br /&gt;nothing is more unpredictable. &lt;br /&gt;The unpredictability of politicians is only one of the many variables complicating the future today.  &lt;br /&gt;Not only can’t we predict people’s actions and the many other things that will determine the course &lt;br /&gt;of the virus and its impact on the economy, but we also certainly can’t predict when they’ll take those &lt;br /&gt;actions – and that will count just as much. &lt;br /&gt;Which Expert to Follow? &lt;br /&gt;In the memo Uncertainty, I quoted at considerable length from an article by Erik Angner.  One of its &lt;br /&gt;most interesting points was as follows: &lt;br /&gt;People who lack the cognitive skills required to perform a task typically also lack the &lt;br /&gt;metacognitive skills required to assess their performance.  Incompetent people are at &lt;br /&gt;a double disadvantage, since they are not only incompetent but also likely unaware of &lt;br /&gt;it.  (Behavioral Scientist, April 13) &lt;br /&gt;By definition, people who lack the expertise in a given field required for superior judgments also lack &lt;br /&gt;the expertise required to assess their level of expertise.  As I mentioned, they qualify as John Kenneth &lt;br /&gt;Galbraith’s forecasters “who don’t know they don’t know.” &lt;br /&gt;While re-reading my memo, I realized I had left out an important further ramification.  Not only do &lt;br /&gt;most people fail to possess superior expertise – as well as the ability to know it – but they also lack &lt;br /&gt;the ability to figure out who does have it.  That’s the catch: you may have to be an expert in a &lt;br /&gt;field in order to be able to figure out who the true experts are.  That’s why research in most fields &lt;br /&gt;is subjected to “peer review,” meaning a review by experts (not to be confused with “a jury of one’s &lt;br /&gt;peers,” meaning other lay citizens).   &lt;br /&gt;And yet, where does the buck stop on the biggest of questions, like those of today?  The answer can’t &lt;br /&gt;be “with the experts.”  An article in The Wall Street Journal set out the dilemma: &lt;br /&gt;To govern, at least   at the level   of the presidency, is to make hard choices among &lt;br /&gt;competing options with incomplete information.  Easier problems are  resolved before &lt;br /&gt;they ever reach the Oval   Office.  Neither scientific data  nor public  sentiments can &lt;br /&gt;properly answer the questions that   face   elected officials.  Both are important and must &lt;br /&gt;be integrated into the judgments that   political    leaders make.  But neither can &lt;br /&gt;substitute for that crucial act of judgment. . . . &lt;br /&gt;The president’s job, and not only in times of crisis, frequently involves listening to &lt;br /&gt;experts disagree with one another and taking responsibility for &lt;br /&gt;choosing among them, &lt;br /&gt;plotting a course through opportunities and dangers.  &lt;br /&gt;The capacity to do this well &lt;br /&gt;involves its own sort of practical wisdom, an expertise in judging expertise. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;(“Experts Aren’t Enough,” May 16-17, emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, like everyone else, I’m bombarded with conflicting views regarding the wisdom of &lt;br /&gt;rapidly reopening the U.S. economy.  Yet I recognize that not only is my opinion on that topic of &lt;br /&gt;little value, but I also don’t have the expertise required to know for sure whose opinion does &lt;br /&gt;count.  What I do know is that the last thing I should do is choose an expert because his or her &lt;br /&gt;opinions agree with mine, and allow confirmation bias to affect my decision. &lt;br /&gt;Further, in considering expertise, we must be leery of some dangerous tendencies in our society: &lt;br /&gt;•to confuse general intelligence with knowledge of the facts relative to a given field,&lt;br /&gt;•to confuse factual knowledge with superior insight,&lt;br /&gt;•to conflate expertise and insight with the ability to predict the future,&lt;br /&gt;•to treat experts in one field as if they’re knowledgeable about all others, and&lt;br /&gt;•to credit rich and successful people with all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, as I’ve described in previous memos, when I travel abroad, I’m often asked what I think of my &lt;br /&gt;host countries’ economies and their    potential.  “Why ask me?”   I respond, “you live here.”     Just &lt;br /&gt;because I know something about investing and the U.S., why should I necessarily have meaningful &lt;br /&gt;insight into other fields   and countries? &lt;br /&gt;We s   ee doctors or public  health officials on TV who inveigh against quickl y reopening the economy.  &lt;br /&gt;They may well know much more than most about the medical and public hea&lt;br /&gt;lth aspects of the &lt;br /&gt;coronavirus and how it should be dealt  with, and their advice is likely to keep the most people ali&lt;br /&gt;ve.  &lt;br /&gt;But on the other   hand, since they’re not economists, we should assume they’re only answering from &lt;br /&gt;the  standpoint of minimizing deaths.  They may not take into consideration the importance of &lt;br /&gt;restarting the economy or how to balance the two considerations. &lt;br /&gt;On the other   hand, we  see  businesspeople and economists talking about the need t o reopen in order to &lt;br /&gt;minimize the damage done to the   economy by keeping it in a deep freeze.  But what do they know &lt;br /&gt;about the cost   in human lives?  And certainly there is no algorithm or accepted process for deciding &lt;br /&gt;between the two.  It’s a matter    of j  udgment, not expertise. &lt;br /&gt;I recently read an article about an often-cited libertarian lawyer and l&lt;br /&gt;egal scholar (unnamed here &lt;br /&gt;because of my general practice of not criticizing individuals) who predicted in mid-March that no &lt;br /&gt;more than 500 people would die from Covid-19 in the U.S. (revised upward to 5,000 when he later &lt;br /&gt;found a statistical error  in his analysis).  While he admitted to having no medical expertise, he said he &lt;br /&gt;did know more than the doctors about evolutionary theory and its applicability to the virus.  His &lt;br /&gt;opinion apparently carried great weight at the time i   n conservative quarters. &lt;br /&gt;Reporters, not being experts themselves, have to consult experts in order to write their   stories.  But &lt;br /&gt;how do they choose and vet the experts they cite?  And to what extent   are their selections a function &lt;br /&gt;of the biases  we  all tend to confirm and the conclusions they want to justify?  In my experience, the &lt;br /&gt;more I know about a subject, the less I’m impressed with related media coverage. &lt;br /&gt;And likewise, elected officials are rarely expert in the fields about which they have to make &lt;br /&gt;decisions.  They, too, have no choice but to depend on experts.  But how do they choose their &lt;br /&gt;experts?  Would they ever consult an expert who belongs to the other party?  I recently read a Wall &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street Journal op-ed piece by a conservative senator suggesting categorically that conservatives and&lt;br /&gt;liberals are different in how they weigh re-opening the economy versus minimizing infections.  Is &lt;br /&gt;such a sweeping (and probably unscientific) generalization more likely to be an appropriate &lt;br /&gt;observation or an example of intellectual bias stemming from ideological division? &lt;br /&gt;So (a) true expertise is scarce and limited in scope, (b) expertise and predictive ability are two &lt;br /&gt;different things, and (c) we all should be careful about whom we listen to and how much weight we &lt;br /&gt;give to their pronouncements. &lt;br /&gt;And one other thing: As Lilla wrote, “People facing immediate danger want to hear an authoritative &lt;br /&gt;voice . . .”  Thus they tend to put inordinate faith in a popular “prophet.”  And when he or she turns &lt;br /&gt;out to be a less-than-perfect forecaster, and thus only human, they go looking for the next one to &lt;br /&gt;anoint.  They never say, “I guess forecasting doesn’t work.”  I would say the same about people in &lt;br /&gt;general, including those looking for help making money without risk or effort.   &lt;br /&gt;A Living Example &lt;br /&gt;Finally, in a related vein, I want to mention a May 19 article by Morgan Housel of Collaborative &lt;br /&gt;Fund, an insightful commentator whose philosophical and behavioral observations tend to resonate &lt;br /&gt;with me.  In it, he told the story of two friends with whom he regularly took the risk of skiing out of &lt;br /&gt;bounds at the resort they frequented as teens.  One day, his friends went out for a second run while he &lt;br /&gt;begged off for no particular reason, and a freak avalanche took their lives.  Here’s his summation: &lt;br /&gt;I don’t know if Brendan and Bryan’s death actually affected how I invest.  But it &lt;br /&gt;opened my eyes to the idea that there are three distinct sides of risk: &lt;br /&gt;•The odds you will get hit.&lt;br /&gt;•The average consequences of getting hit.&lt;br /&gt;•The tail-end consequences of getting hit.&lt;br /&gt;The first two are easy to grasp.  It’s the third that’s hardest to learn, and can often &lt;br /&gt;only be learned through experience. &lt;br /&gt;We knew we were taking risks when we skied.  We knew that going out of bounds &lt;br /&gt;was wrong, and that we might get caught.  But at 17 years old we figured the &lt;br /&gt;consequences of risk meant our coaches might yell at us.  Maybe we’d get our season &lt;br /&gt;pass revoked for the year. &lt;br /&gt;Never, not once, did we think we’d pay the ultimate price. &lt;br /&gt;But once you go through something like that, you realize that the tail-end &lt;br /&gt;consequences – the low-probability, high-impact events – are all that matter. &lt;br /&gt;In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news &lt;br /&gt;headlines.  But the tail-end consequences of risk – like pandemics, and depressions – &lt;br /&gt;are what make the pages of history books.  They’re all that matter.  They’re all you&lt;br /&gt;should focus on.  We spent the last decade debating whether economic risk meant the &lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve set interest rates at 0.25% or 0.5%.  Then 36 million people lost their &lt;br /&gt;jobs in two months because of a virus. It’s absurd. &lt;br /&gt;Tail-end events are all that matter. &lt;br /&gt;Thi s introduces one of t  he grea t conundrums associated with investing.  Since we know nothing &lt;br /&gt;about the future, we have no choice but to rely on extrapolation of pas  t patterns.  By “past patterns,” &lt;br /&gt;we mean what has normally happened in the past and wit h what s  everity.  And yet, there’s no &lt;br /&gt;reason why (a) thi ngs can’  t happen that diffe   r fr om thos e tha t happened in the pas  t and ( b) future &lt;br /&gt;event  s can’  t be wors   e than those of t  he past in terms of s  everity and thus consequences.  While we &lt;br /&gt;look to the pas  t for guidance as to t he “worst case  ,” there’s no reason why futur  e experience should &lt;br /&gt;be limite   d to tha  t of the past.  B ut wit hout reliance on the past to inform us regarding the wors t case, &lt;br /&gt;we can’  t know much about how to inves   t &lt;br /&gt;our c   apita   l or li ve our l   ives.   &lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, my friend Ric Kayne pointed out that “95% of all financial history happens &lt;br /&gt;withi   n two standard deviations of normal, and everything interesting happens outsid  e of two &lt;br /&gt;standard deviations.”  Arguably, bubbles and crashes fal l outsi de of t  wo standard deviations, but &lt;br /&gt;they are the event  s that creat  e and eliminate the greates   t fortunes.  We can’  t know muc h in advance &lt;br /&gt;about their nature or dimensions.  Or about rare, exogenous events like pandemics. &lt;br /&gt;In 2001, I wrote a memo titled You Can’t Predict.  You Can Prepare.  At first glance, that seems &lt;br /&gt;like an oxymoron.  How can we prepare for something if we can’t predict it?  Turned around, if the &lt;br /&gt;grea&lt;br /&gt;tes t extremes and mos t influential exogenous event  s are unpredictable, how can w e prepar  e for &lt;br /&gt;them  ?  We can do so by recognizing that they inevitably will occur , and by making our portfolios &lt;br /&gt;mor e cauti   ous when economic developments and investor be  havi  or r  ende r m arket   s more vulnerable &lt;br /&gt;to dama   ge from untowa&lt;br /&gt;rd events.  &lt;br /&gt;Th at l  in e of r  easoning suggests a glimmer of good news  : we may not b e able to predict t he &lt;br /&gt;future, but that doesn’t mean we’re powerless to deal with it. &lt;br /&gt;May 28, 2020&lt;br /&gt;2020 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re: Something of Value &lt;br /&gt;If asked about possible silver linings to this pandemic, I would list first the chance to spend more time &lt;br /&gt;with family.  Our son Andrew and his wife and son moved in with Nancy and me in Los Angeles at the &lt;br /&gt;beginning of the pandemic, as they were renovating their house when Covid-19 hit, and we lived together &lt;br /&gt;for the next ten weeks.  There’s nothing like getting to spend months at a time building relationships with &lt;br /&gt;grandchildren, something we were privileged to do in 2020.  I’m sure the impact will literally last &lt;br /&gt;lifetimes. &lt;br /&gt;As I’ve previously reported, Andrew is a professional investor who focuses on making long-term &lt;br /&gt;investments in what the world calls “growth companies,” and especially technology companies.  He’s had &lt;br /&gt;a great 2020, and it’s hard to argue with success.  Our living together led me to talk with him and think a &lt;br /&gt;great deal about subjects on which I hadn’t previously spent much time, contributing a lot to what I’ll &lt;br /&gt;cover in this memo. &lt;br /&gt;* *  * &lt;br /&gt;I’ve written before about how the questions I’m asked give me a good sense for what’s really on people’s &lt;br /&gt;minds.  These days, one I frequently field is about the outlook for “value” investing.  “Growth” stocks &lt;br /&gt;have meaningfully outperformed “value” for the last 13 years – so long that people are asking me whether &lt;br /&gt;it’s going to be a permanent condition.  My extensive discussions with Andrew led me to conclude that &lt;br /&gt;the focus on value versus growth doesn’t serve investors well in the fast-changing world in which we live.  &lt;br /&gt;I’ll start by describing value investing and how investors might think about value in 2021. &lt;br /&gt;What is Value Investing? &lt;br /&gt;Value investing is one of the key disciplines in the world of investing.  It consists of quantifying what &lt;br /&gt;something is worth intrinsically, based primarily on its fundamental, cash flow-generating capabilities, &lt;br /&gt;and buying it if its price represents a meaningful discount from that value.  Cash flows are estimated as &lt;br /&gt;far into the future as possible and discounted back to their present value using a discount rate made up of &lt;br /&gt;the prevailing risk-free rate (usually the yield on U.S. Treasurys) plus a premium to compensate for their &lt;br /&gt;uncertain nature.  There are a lot of common valuation metrics, like the ratio of price to sales, or to &lt;br /&gt;earnings, but they’re largely subsumed by the discounted cash flow, or DCF, method.   &lt;br /&gt;Now, determining this value in practice is quite challenging, and the key to success lies not in the ability &lt;br /&gt;to perform a mathematical calculation, but rather in making superior judgments regarding the relevant &lt;br /&gt;inputs.  Simply put, the DCF method is the main tool of all value investors in their effort to make &lt;br /&gt;investment decisions based on companies’ long-term fundamentals. &lt;br /&gt;Importantly, value investors recognize that the securities they buy are not just pieces of paper, but rather &lt;br /&gt;ownership stakes in (or, in the case of credit, claims on) actual businesses.  These financial instruments &lt;br /&gt;have a fundamental worth, and it can be quite different from the price quoted in the market, which is &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;based on the manic-depressive ups and downs of a character Benjamin Graham called “Mr. Market.”  On &lt;br /&gt;any given day, Mr. Market can be exuberant or despondent, and he quotes prices for securities based on &lt;br /&gt;how he feels.  The value investor understands that – rather than informing us as to what a given asset’s &lt;br /&gt;value is – Mr. Market is there to serve us by offering up securities at prices, which can be meaningfully &lt;br /&gt;disconnected from the actual value of a stake or claim in the underlying business.  In doing so, he &lt;br /&gt;sometimes gives us the opportunity to snatch up shares or bonds at a meaningful discount from their &lt;br /&gt;intrinsic value.  This activity requires independent thought and a temperament that resists the emotional &lt;br /&gt;pull of the market cycle, making for decisions based solely on value. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, to me the essential underlying principles of value investing are these: &lt;br /&gt;•the understanding of securities as stakes in actual businesses,&lt;br /&gt;•the focus on true worth as opposed to price,&lt;br /&gt;•the use of fundamentals to calculate intrinsic value,&lt;br /&gt;•the recognition that attractive investments come when there is a wide divergence between the&lt;br /&gt;price at which something is offered in the market and the actual fundamental worth you’ve&lt;br /&gt;determined, and&lt;br /&gt;•the emotional discipline to act when such an opportunity is presented and not otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Value vs. Growth &lt;br /&gt;Over the last 80-90 years, two important developments occurred with regard to investing style.  The first &lt;br /&gt;was the establishment of value investing, as described above.  Next came “growth investing,” targeting a &lt;br /&gt;new breed of companies that were expected to grow rapidly and were accorded high valuation metrics in &lt;br /&gt;recognition of their exceptional long-term potential.   &lt;br /&gt;It seems likely that the label “value” was applied to the value school because one of its greatest early &lt;br /&gt;popularizers, Ben Graham, practiced a low-valuation style.  Deemed “cigar butt” investing by his protégé &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett, Graham’s style emphasized the search for pedestrian companies whose shares were &lt;br /&gt;selling at discounts from liquidation value based on the assets on their balance sheets, which Buffett &lt;br /&gt;likened to searching the street for used cigar butts that had one last puff left in them.  It is this style that &lt;br /&gt;Graham preached in his Columbia Business School classes and his books, Security Analysis and The &lt;br /&gt;Intelligent Investor, which are considered the bibles of  value investing.  His investment style relied on &lt;br /&gt;fixed formulas to arrive at measures of statistical cheapness.  Graham went on to achieve enviable &lt;br /&gt;investment performance although, funnily enough, he would later admit that he earned more on   one long-&lt;br /&gt;term investment in a growth company, GEICO, than in all his other investments combined.   &lt;br /&gt;Buffett, the patron saint of value investors, also practiced cigar butt investing with great success in  the &lt;br /&gt;first &lt;br /&gt;decades of his career, until his partner, Charlie Munger, convinced him to broaden his definition of &lt;br /&gt;“value” and shift his focu  s to “great businesses at fair prices,” in particular because doing so would enable &lt;br /&gt;him to deploy much more capital at high returns.   Thi  s led Buffett to invest in growing companies – such &lt;br /&gt;as Coca-Cola, GEICO and the Washington Post – that he could purchase at valuations that were not &lt;br /&gt;particularly low in the absolute, but that he   found attractive given his understanding of their competitive &lt;br /&gt;advantages and future earnings potential.  While Buffett has long understood that a company’s prospects &lt;br /&gt;are an enormous component of its value, his general avoidance of technology stocks throughout his career &lt;br /&gt;may have unintentionally caused most value investors to boycott those stocks.  Intriguingly, Buffett &lt;br /&gt;allows that his recent investment in Apple has been one of his most successful. &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, a subset of value investors adopted a harder-line approach, with a pronounced emphasis on &lt;br /&gt;low valuation metrics.  Graham and Buffett’s cigar butts had featured low valuation metrics, and this no &lt;br /&gt;doubt caused some value investors to elevate this characteristic to be the core consideration in their &lt;br /&gt;investment process.  It’s interesting to note that the methodology for populating the S&amp;P 500 Value Index &lt;br /&gt;relies solely on finding the one-third of the S&amp;P 500’s market capitalization with the highest ratio of &lt;br /&gt;Value Rank (based on the lowest average multiple of earnings, sales and book value) to Growth Rank &lt;br /&gt;(based on the highest three-year growth in sales and earnings and 12-month price change).  In other &lt;br /&gt;words, the stocks in the Value Index are those that are most characterized by “low-valuation parameters” &lt;br /&gt;and least characterized by “growth.”  But “carrying low valuation parameters” is far from &lt;br /&gt;synonymous with “underpriced.”  It’s easy to be seduced by the former, but a stock with a low p/e &lt;br /&gt;ratio, for example, is likely to be a bargain only if its current earnings and recent earnings growth are &lt;br /&gt;indicative of the future.  Just pursuing low valuation metrics can lead you to so-called “value traps”: &lt;br /&gt;things that look cheap on the numbers but aren’t, because they have operating weaknesses or because the &lt;br /&gt;sales and earnings creating those valuations can’t be replicated in the future.   &lt;br /&gt;The growth investing camp, on the other hand, came into existence during the “go-go” early years of the &lt;br /&gt;1960s, the decade in which I started my career in the equity research department at First National City &lt;br /&gt;Bank.  Investor interest in rapid growth led to anointment of the so-called Nifty Fifty stocks, which &lt;br /&gt;became the investment focus of many of the money-center banks (including my employer), which were &lt;br /&gt;the leading institutional investors of the day.  This group comprised the fifty companies believed to be the &lt;br /&gt;best and fastest-growing in America: companies that were considered so good that “nothing bad could &lt;br /&gt;happen to them” and “there was no price too high” for their shares.  Like the objects of most manias, the &lt;br /&gt;Nifty Fifty stocks showed phenomenal performance for years as the companies’ earnings grew and their &lt;br /&gt;valuations rose to nosebleed levels, before declining precipitously between 1972 and 1974.  Thanks to &lt;br /&gt;that crash, they showed negative holding-period returns for many years.  Their dismal performance cost &lt;br /&gt;me my job as director of equity research (and led to my being assigned to start funds for investment in &lt;br /&gt;high yield and convertible bonds – my lucky break).  It’s worth noting, however, that the truly durable &lt;br /&gt;growth companies among the Nifty Fifty – about half of them – compiled respectable returns for 25 years, &lt;br /&gt;even when measured from their pre-crash highs, suggesting that very high valuations can be &lt;br /&gt;fundamentally justified in the long term for the rare breed of company.  &lt;br /&gt;The two approaches – value and growth – have divided the investment world for the last fifty years. &lt;br /&gt;They’ve become not only schools of investing thought, but also labels used to differentiate products, &lt;br /&gt;managers and organizations.  Based on this distinction, a persistent scoreboard is maintained measuring &lt;br /&gt;the performance of one camp against the other.  Today it shows that the performance of value investing &lt;br /&gt;lagged that of growth investing over the past decade-plus (and massively so in 2020), leading some to &lt;br /&gt;declare value investing permanently dead while others assert that its great resurgence is just around the &lt;br /&gt;corner.  My belief, especially after some deep reflection over the past year – prompted by my &lt;br /&gt;conversations with Andrew – is that the two should never have been viewed as mutually exclusive to &lt;br /&gt;begin with.  We’ll get to that shortly. &lt;br /&gt;Vantage Points &lt;br /&gt;An interesting aspect of my discussions with Andrew has been our joint recognition of the fact that we &lt;br /&gt;come from very different backgrounds, and perhaps for that reason we look at investing from &lt;br /&gt;considerably different vantage points.  &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to form my investment philosophy in the 1960s.  Investment thought was much less developed at &lt;br /&gt;that time, and what did exist was heavily dominated by the philosophy espoused by Ben Graham.  Buffett &lt;br /&gt;wa s still searching for his last puff of “cigar butts” and had yet to coin the term “moat” in reference to the &lt;br /&gt;lasting competitive advantages that sustain high-quality businesses.  My philosophy was informed by the &lt;br /&gt;fact that I started   working in 1969, during the “Nifty Fifty” bubble, which I watched crash around me.  &lt;br /&gt;It was further shaped by my transition in 1978 from equities to fixed income investments in the form of &lt;br /&gt;convertible and high yield bonds.  Importantly, Graham and his less famous co-author, David Dodd, &lt;br /&gt;characterized bond management as a “negative art.”  What did they mean?  In general, bond investors’ &lt;br /&gt;return is capped at a yield that stems from the promised interest payments and payoff at par upon &lt;br /&gt;maturity; that’s why it’s called “fixed income.”  The upshot is that all bonds bought at a 6% yield will &lt;br /&gt;return 6% when held to maturity if they pay.  Bond   s that don’t pay, on the other hand, will produce losses &lt;br /&gt;of  varying magnitudes.  Thus, oversimplifying, you improve your performance in bonds not through &lt;br /&gt;which paying bonds you buy (since all 6% bonds that pay will have the same return), but through what &lt;br /&gt;you exclude (that is, whether you’re able to avoid the ones that don’t pay).  Clearly, this is very different &lt;br /&gt;from equities, where your upside is theoretically unlimited, requiring that investors intelligently  balance &lt;br /&gt;downside risk and upside potential.   &lt;br /&gt;To be a good equity investor, I think you have to be an optimist; certainly, it’s no activity for doomsayers. &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the term “optimistic bond investor” is practically an oxymoron.  Since bonds generally &lt;br /&gt;lack potential for long-term returns in excess of their promised yields, bond investing mostly requires &lt;br /&gt;skepticism and attention to the downside.  One of the reasons I did well in fixed income is that it played &lt;br /&gt;to my natural conservatism.  And since tech companies issue relatively few bonds, it also accommodated &lt;br /&gt;my lack of focus on technology, which has never been of particular interest to me and has always felt a bit &lt;br /&gt;“over my head.”  I’m certainly not an “early adopter,” nor do I have a history of recognizing emerging &lt;br /&gt;technological trends in their infancy. &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as a child of parents who were born in the early 1900s and thus were adults during the Great &lt;br /&gt;Depression, my thought process was shaped by the deprivation and fear they had experienced.  Because &lt;br /&gt;they had been made so painfully aware of the value of a dollar and how quickly things could change for &lt;br /&gt;the worse, they considered the future and the possibility of loss things to worry about.  Adages like “don’t &lt;br /&gt;put all your eggs in one basket” and “save for a rainy day” were watchwords I grew up with.  Thi  s is  very &lt;br /&gt;different from the experience of those whose parents were born a decade or two later than mine, never &lt;br /&gt;lived with deprivation, and may never have heard those words.  These influences and experiences led me &lt;br /&gt;to adopt a value approach and the persona of a “bargain hunter,” which has served me well in my chosen &lt;br /&gt;field, which now has come to be called “credit.” &lt;br /&gt;Andrew has a considerably different mindset.  Clearly, his early experience was very different from mine, &lt;br /&gt;not m&lt;br /&gt;arked by anything like the Depression.  He was bitten by the investment bug early, and from a &lt;br /&gt;young age investing dominated our conversations.  While he deeply appreciates some elements of my &lt;br /&gt;philosophy – such as t&lt;br /&gt;he importance of understanding investor psychology, focusing on fundamentals, &lt;br /&gt;and contrarianism – he ha   s &lt;br /&gt;forged his own path and ended up in a very different place.  Hi s first phase &lt;br /&gt;wa s spent as a “Buffett nerd,” consuming everything written by the Oracle and adhering strongly to his &lt;br /&gt;philosophy.  But over time, he has developed his own perspective and transitioned to investing primarily &lt;br /&gt;in technology and other growth-oriented companies.  He spends the vast majority of his time managing a &lt;br /&gt;venture firm called TQ Ventures with his two partners, but he also steers our family’s “upside-oriented &lt;br /&gt;investments” with great results.  (I, fittingly, handle our more conservative investments).  &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contrast of viewpoints, particularly in 2020, has created extraordinary opportunities for discussion &lt;br /&gt;and learning.  From this point on, most of what I write will consist of what Andrew has caused me to &lt;br /&gt;appreciate in my 75&lt;br /&gt;th&lt;br /&gt; year. &lt;br /&gt;The False Dichotomy of Value and Growth &lt;br /&gt;At some point, the camps of value and growth developed nearly the same fervent adherence as rival &lt;br /&gt;political factions.  You pledged allegiance to one or the other, and so went your future investing actions.  &lt;br /&gt;You believed your way was the only way and looked down on practitioners of the other.  I think investors &lt;br /&gt;–perhaps based on their emotional makeup, intellectual orientation and understanding of things like&lt;br /&gt;technological innovation – naturally gravitated toward one side of the stylistic divide or the other.  And&lt;br /&gt;there are notable differences:&lt;br /&gt;•Value stocks, anchored by today’s cash flows and asset values, should theoretically be “safer”&lt;br /&gt;and more protected, albeit less likely to earn the great returns delivered by companies that aspire&lt;br /&gt;to rapidly grow sales and earnings into the distant future.&lt;br /&gt;•Growth investing often entails belief in unproven business models that can suffer serious setbacks&lt;br /&gt;from time to time, requiring investors to have deep conviction so as to be able to hang on.&lt;br /&gt;•When they’re rising, growth stocks typically incorporate a level of optimism that can evaporate&lt;br /&gt;during corrections, testing even the most steeled investor.  And because growth stocks depend for&lt;br /&gt;most of their value on cash flows in the distant future that are heavily discounted in a DCF&lt;br /&gt;analysis, a given change in interest rates can have meaningfully greater impact on their valuations&lt;br /&gt;than it will on companies whose value comes mainly from near-term cash flows.&lt;br /&gt;Despite these points, I don’t believe the famous value investors who so influenced the field intended &lt;br /&gt;for there to be such a sharp delineation between value investing, with its focus on the present day, &lt;br /&gt;low price and predictability, and growth investing, with its emphasis on rapidly growing &lt;br /&gt;companies, even when selling at high valuations.  Nor i   s the distinction essential, natural or helpful, &lt;br /&gt;especially in the complex world in which we find ourselves today.  Both Graham and Buffett achieved &lt;br /&gt;success across a variety of styles and, more importantly, viewed value investing as consisting of &lt;br /&gt;adherence to fundamental business analysis, divorced from the study of market price action.  As Buffett &lt;br /&gt;put it, “We don’t consider ourselves to be value investors. . . .  Discounted cash proceeds is the &lt;br /&gt;appropriate way to value any business. . . .  There is no such thing in our minds as value and growth &lt;br /&gt;investing.”  It just so happened that considerable opportunity existed for them in the cigar butt arena at the &lt;br /&gt;time they operated – especially considering that both started with relatively small amounts of money with &lt;br /&gt;which to invest – so that’s what they emphasized.  But a   s the world evolved, the landscape of &lt;br /&gt;opportunities has changed significantly. &lt;br /&gt;There’s  a saying that “to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”  The widely discussed &lt;br /&gt;distinction between value and growth made some people believe they only had hammers, when in fact &lt;br /&gt;they potentially had access to a whole toolbox.  Now we live in a complex world where a range of tools &lt;br /&gt;is  required for success. &lt;br /&gt;A More Efficient World &lt;br /&gt;As mentioned earlier, the investment world back when Buffett and Graham were first practicing their &lt;br /&gt;version of value investing was considerably different from the current one.  First, the level of &lt;br /&gt;competition &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wa s much lower, almost unrecognizable when compared to today.  Investment management wasn’t a hot &lt;br /&gt;field in which many people aspired to spend their careers.  It was instead a cottage industry, with a small &lt;br /&gt;number of outfits practicing quite traditional activities.  Second, information was extremely hard to come &lt;br /&gt;by and process.  There were no computers, spreadsheets or databases.  Before researching a stock, you &lt;br /&gt;first had to find it in either the back of the newspaper (if it was a mainstream issue) or large books put &lt;br /&gt;together by firms like Moody’s and Value Line (if it was more thinly traded).  Then you had to either &lt;br /&gt;send a request to the company for the annual report or go to the library hoping to find a copy of the report &lt;br /&gt;or a broader publication that included the company’s financial statements.  And third, with the industry so &lt;br /&gt;small, nascent and unpopular, the investment thought process wasn’t something broadly developed or &lt;br /&gt;disseminated.  The key analytical frameworks were not yet codified, and folks like Graham and Buffett &lt;br /&gt;had a huge edge simply because they knew how to process the data they found.  In short, there were few &lt;br /&gt;people searching; the search process was quite difficult; and few people knew how to turn the data they &lt;br /&gt;did find into profitable investment conclusions.  In thi   s environment, bargains could literally be hiding in &lt;br /&gt;plain sight for anyone with the willingness to look and the capacity to analyze. &lt;br /&gt;When Buffett was applying his cigar butt approach to  running his early investment partnership – which &lt;br /&gt;racked up a tremendous record – he famously used to sit in his back room in Omaha, flipping through the &lt;br /&gt;thousands of pages of Moody’s Manual, and he would buy shares in small companies that were trading at &lt;br /&gt;enormous discounts from liquidation value for the simple reason that no   one    else paid attention to them.  &lt;br /&gt;In one cas&lt;br /&gt;e, that of National American Fire Insurance, Buffett was able to buy the stock at 1x earnings by &lt;br /&gt;driving around to farmers who had decades earlier been stuffed by promoters with stock they’d since &lt;br /&gt;forgotten about, and handing them cash on their front porch.   Thus, the Grahamian value framework was &lt;br /&gt;created at  a time when things could be stupidly cheap based on clearly observable facts, simply because &lt;br /&gt;the search process was very difficult and opaque.  &lt;br /&gt;As time went on, the diligent analyst’s information advantage began to slowly dissipate, but it  still existed &lt;br /&gt;for a good while.  Prior to the broad adoption of the Internet and the explosion of the investment industry &lt;br /&gt;in the early years of this century, information and analytical methods were still hard to come by.  One still &lt;br /&gt;had to mail away for annual reports as recently as the 1990s, and while more people may have known &lt;br /&gt;how to find pure balance sheet arbitrages like Graham practiced in the 1950 s and ’60s, seemingly basic &lt;br /&gt;analytical concepts like return on invested capital, competitive moats and the importance of free cash flow &lt;br /&gt;(rather than GAAP earnings) were not widely appreciated.  And certainly, most people didn’t understand &lt;br /&gt;the dynamics around what are called “special situations,” which become available when complex &lt;br /&gt;corporate actions create investment opportunities by giving rise to significant mispricings.  There was still &lt;br /&gt;the opp&lt;br /&gt;ortunity to find bargains in plain sight, albeit perhaps with an extra level of sophistication &lt;br /&gt;required. &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today, and everything has changed.  The investment industry is wildly competitive, with &lt;br /&gt;ten s of thousands of funds managing trillions of dollars.  Investment management is one of the most &lt;br /&gt;desirable careers, prompting complaints about “brain drain” as intellectual prodigies eschew careers as &lt;br /&gt;world-changing scientists or inventors in exchange for jobs on Wall Street.  Warren Buffett has evolved &lt;br /&gt;from a man buying cheap stocks in hi   s home office to an international celebrity, with 50,000 investors &lt;br /&gt;from around the world making the pilgrimage to Omaha each year for the Berkshire Hathaway annual &lt;br /&gt;meeting.  Information is incredibly ubiquitous, with seemingly endless amounts of data – not to mention &lt;br /&gt;books, articles, blogs and podcasts about investment methodologies and specific stock research – &lt;br /&gt;available on your mobile phone in seconds.  And, not only is information broadly available and easily &lt;br /&gt;accessed, but billions of doll&lt;br /&gt;ar s are spent annually on specialized data and computer  systems designed to &lt;br /&gt;suss out and act on any discernable dislocation in the marketplace.  All this is largely motivated by the &lt;br /&gt;fact that many of the greatest fortunes made in the last forty years belong to people in the investment &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;profession.  In contrast, when I entered the business in the late 1960s, few investors were “household &lt;br /&gt;names,” investment industry incomes were in line with those in other professions, and only a handful of &lt;br /&gt;investors had a “carried interest” in their clients’ profits. &lt;br /&gt;In the past, bargains could be available for the picking, based on readily observable data and basic &lt;br /&gt;analysis.  Today it seems foolish to think that such things could be found with any level of &lt;br /&gt;frequency.  If something about a company can be easily read in an annual report, or readily discovered by &lt;br /&gt;a mathematically competent analyst or a computer, it stands to reason that, in most cases, this should &lt;br /&gt;already be appreciated by the marketplace and thus incorporated in the prices of the company’s securities.  &lt;br /&gt;That’s the essence of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  Thus, in the world we live in today, investing on &lt;br /&gt;the basis of rote formulas and readily available fundamental, quantitative metrics should not be &lt;br /&gt;particularly profitable.  (This is not necessarily true during market downturns and panics, when selling &lt;br /&gt;pressure can cause prices to decouple from fundamentals.)  It also stands to reason that in a time when &lt;br /&gt;readily discernable quantitative data is unlikely to produce high-profit opportunities: &lt;br /&gt;•if something carries a low valuation, there’s probably a good reason, and&lt;br /&gt;•successful investing has to be more about superior judgments concerning (a) qualitative,&lt;br /&gt;non-computable factors and (b) how things are likely to unfold in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Grandfather’s Market &lt;br /&gt;Not only are the traditional staples of classic value investing (readily discernable quantitative measures of &lt;br /&gt;cheapness in the here-and-now) no longer likely to produce a sustainable edge on their own, but the world &lt;br /&gt;has gotten more complex, with many more dynamics that can drive a decoupling of near-term metrics &lt;br /&gt;from valuation, both to the positive and negative. &lt;br /&gt;Back in the old days, Warren Buffett could find businesses that clearly were likely to remain dominant for &lt;br /&gt;long periods of time and perform relatively straightforward analysis to assess their valuation.  For &lt;br /&gt;instance, he could look at something like the Washington Post, which essentially became the monopoly &lt;br /&gt;newspaper in a major city, and invest on the basis of reasonable, consistent assumptions regarding a few &lt;br /&gt;variables like circulation, subscription prices and ad rates.  It was a foregone conclusion that the paper &lt;br /&gt;would remain dominant because of its strong moat, and thus that the past would look very much like the &lt;br /&gt;future.  In contrast today: &lt;br /&gt;•Because markets are global in nature, and the Internet and software have vastly increased their&lt;br /&gt;ultimate profit potential, technology firms or technologically aided businesses can grow to be&lt;br /&gt;much more valuable than we previously could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;•Innovation and technical adoption are happening at a much more rapid pace than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;•It has never been easier to start a company, and there has never been more capital available to&lt;br /&gt;fund entrepreneurship.&lt;br /&gt;•There have also never been as many highly capable people focused on starting and building&lt;br /&gt;companies.&lt;br /&gt;•Since many of these companies are selling products primarily made with code, their costs and&lt;br /&gt;capital requirements are extremely low and their profitability – especially on incremental sales –&lt;br /&gt;is unusually high.  Thus, the economics of winners have never been more attractive, with very&lt;br /&gt;high profit margins and minimal capital requirements.&lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Because the friction and marginal cost of scaling over the Internet can be so low, businesses can&lt;br /&gt;grow much more rapidly than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;•It has never been more acceptable for public companies to lose money in the pursuit of a large&lt;br /&gt;prize down the road.  This in turn leads to obfuscation of the real potential economics of winners&lt;br /&gt;and makes differentiating between winners and losers difficult without great, insightful effort to&lt;br /&gt;peel back the onion.&lt;br /&gt;•As developing and scaling new products is much easier in the digital world (often requiring little&lt;br /&gt;more than engineers and code), it’s never been more possible for companies to develop&lt;br /&gt;completely new avenues of growth, further extending their runways (Amazon’s AWS and&lt;br /&gt;Square’s Cash App are two notable examples).  This gives real value to intangibles such as&lt;br /&gt;exceptional management, engineering talent and strategic positioning with customers.&lt;br /&gt;•The moats protecting today’s winners have never been stronger, and as Brian Arthur pointed out&lt;br /&gt;in “Increasing Returns and the New World of Business,” his amazing piece of almost 25 years&lt;br /&gt;ago, the winners often get stronger and more effective as they get bigger, rather than bloated and&lt;br /&gt;inefficient.&lt;br /&gt;•Conversely, the onslaught of startups with readily available capital and minimal barriers to&lt;br /&gt;scaling means that the durability of legacy businesses has never been more vulnerable or&lt;br /&gt;uncertain.&lt;br /&gt;•At the same time, however, it’s important to recognize that the leading tech firms face threats&lt;br /&gt;from trustbusters who believe these companies have developed excessive market power.&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, businesses are both more vulnerable and more dominant in today’s world, with much &lt;br /&gt;greater opportunities for dramatic changes in fortune, both positive and negative.  On the positive side, &lt;br /&gt;successful businesses have much more potential for long runways of high growth, superior economics, &lt;br /&gt;and significant durability, creating a huge pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and seemingly justifying &lt;br /&gt;valuations for the potentially deserving that are off-puttingly high by historical standards.  On the &lt;br /&gt;negative side, it also creates immense temptation for investors to overvalue undeserving companies.  And &lt;br /&gt;companies with here-and-now cash flows and seeming stability can see those evaporate as soon as a &lt;br /&gt;bunch of Stanford computer science students get funding and traction for their new idea. &lt;br /&gt;When I consider this new world, I think fundamental investors need to be willing to thoroughly &lt;br /&gt;examine situations – including those with heavy dependency on intangible assets and growth into &lt;br /&gt;the distant future – with the goal of achieving real insight.  However, this is, to an extent, &lt;br /&gt;antithetical to the value investor’s mentality.  Part of what makes up the value investor’s mindset is &lt;br /&gt;insistence on observable value in the here-and-now and an aversion to things that seem ephemeral or &lt;br /&gt;uncertain.  Many of the great bonanzas for value investors have come in periods of panic following &lt;br /&gt;the bursting of bubbles, and this fact has probably led value investors to be very skeptical of &lt;br /&gt;market exuberance, especially when concerning companies whose assets are intangible.  Skepticism &lt;br /&gt;is important for any investor; it’s always essential to challenge assumptions, avoid herd mentality and &lt;br /&gt;think independently.  Skepticism keeps investors safe and helps them avoid things that are “too good to &lt;br /&gt;be true.”   &lt;br /&gt;But I also think skepticism can lead to knee-jerk dismissiveness.  While it’s important not to lose your &lt;br /&gt;skepticism, it’s also very important in this new world to be curious, look deeply into things and seek to &lt;br /&gt;truly understand them from the bottom up, rather than dismissing them out of hand.  I worry that value &lt;br /&gt;investing can lead to the rote application of formulas and that, in times of great change, applying formulas &lt;br /&gt;that are based on past experience and models of the prior world can lead to massive error.  John &lt;br /&gt;Templeton warned about the risk that’s created when people say, “it’s different this time,” but he also &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;allowed that 20 percent of the time they’re   right.  Given the rising impact of technology in the 21st &lt;br /&gt;century, I’d bet that  percentage is a lot higher today. &lt;br /&gt;It’s also worth noting with regard to truly dominant companies that are able to achieve rapid, durable and &lt;br /&gt;highly profitable growth that it is very, very hard to overprice them based on near-term multiples.  The &lt;br /&gt;basic equations of finance were not built to handle high-double-digit growth as far as the eye can see, &lt;br /&gt;making the valuation of rapid growers a complicated matter.  As John Malone famously said, if your &lt;br /&gt;long-term growth rate exceeds your cost of capital, your present value is infinite.  However, this is only &lt;br /&gt;true for truly special companies, which are few and far between and certainly not as ubiquitous as &lt;br /&gt;is generally implied by the market in  times of ebullience.  It ’s  important to note, that when markets &lt;br /&gt;are  at extreme levels of optimism, as we saw in both the Nifty Fifty and Dot Com bubbles,   (a) every &lt;br /&gt;company in the affected field is treated as a long-term winner, (b) if bought in times of significant &lt;br /&gt;optimism and extreme valuations for growth, the stocks of even the greatest companies are likely to &lt;br /&gt;produce outcomes that are mediocre at best, and (c) in the crashes that follow most bubbles, enormous &lt;br /&gt;interim markdowns can befall good companies as well as bad, requiring sharp analysis to differentiate &lt;br /&gt;between them, and high conviction and an iron stomach to hold on.    &lt;br /&gt;I want to make very clear that I do   not intend this to imply an opinion about growth stocks’ &lt;br /&gt;valuations today.  I’ve heard a variet&lt;br /&gt;y of views, and while I have my own, I don’t want to make it the &lt;br /&gt;subject of this memo.  In the spirit of seeking to understand this new world, market commentators &lt;br /&gt;(including me) would be well served to understand the fundamentals underpinning the small number of &lt;br /&gt;companies that currently drive a huge percentage of the market, instead of basing top-down conclusions &lt;br /&gt;on purely historical valuation comparisons.  And it seems imprudent to opine on the level of the overall &lt;br /&gt;market without being fully informed regarding the tech companies that now account for so much of equity &lt;br /&gt;indices like the S&amp;P 500.  As Andrew repeatedly reminds me, it’s har&lt;br /&gt;d to make a convincing case that &lt;br /&gt;today’s market is too high if you can’t explain why its tech leaders are overvalued.   &lt;br /&gt;But by far the most important intention of this memo is to explore the mindset that I think will &lt;br /&gt;prove most successful for value investors over the coming decades, regardless of what the market &lt;br /&gt;does in the years just ahead.  It’s important to note that (a) the potential range of outcomes for many of &lt;br /&gt;today’s companies is very wide and (b) there are considerations with enormous implications for the &lt;br /&gt;ultimate value of many companies that do not show up in readily available quantitative metrics.  They &lt;br /&gt;include superior technology, competitive advantage, latent earning power, the value of human capital as &lt;br /&gt;opposed to &lt;br /&gt;capital equipment, and the potential option value of future growth opportunities.  In other &lt;br /&gt;words, determining the appropriateness of the market price of companies today requires deep micro-&lt;br /&gt;understanding, and that makes it virtually impossible to opine on the valuation of a rapidly growing &lt;br /&gt;company from 30,000 feet or by applying traditional value parameters to superficial projections.  Some of &lt;br /&gt;today’s lofty valuations are probably more than justified by future prospects, while others are &lt;br /&gt;laughable – just as certain companies that c&lt;br /&gt;arry low valuations can be facing imminent demise, &lt;br /&gt;while others are just momentarily impaired.  The key, as always, is to understand how today’s market &lt;br /&gt;price relates to the company’s broadly defined intrinsic value, including its prospects.   &lt;br /&gt;The Heart of the Problem &lt;br /&gt;Consider two companies.  Company A is a respected long-term competitor selling a widely consumed, &lt;br /&gt;fairly prosaic product.  It ha  s built a decades-long record that shows modest but steady sales growth and &lt;br /&gt;healthy profit margins.  It manufactures its product using heavy machinery located on its own premises.  &lt;br /&gt;Its stock sells at a modest multiple of earnings per share.   &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company B, on the other hand, was formed a few years ago with the goal of disrupting a legacy industry.  &lt;br /&gt;It has a brief but impressive record of sales growth, albeit at modest absolute dollar levels and with &lt;br /&gt;limited profitability.  It plans to accelerate its sales growth and build market share over the next several &lt;br /&gt;years, overtake its more traditional prey, and then expand its profit margins by tapering spending on R&amp;D &lt;br /&gt;and customer acquisition, raising prices, and scaling into its largely fixed cost structure.  Its products are &lt;br /&gt;constantly evolving and innovating, and they emerge not from factories, but rather the minds of engineers &lt;br /&gt;doing coding.  It has no current earnings, but because of its potential, sells at a lofty multiple of sales. &lt;br /&gt;Value investors are likely to consider it easy to predict and value Company A, with its time-tested &lt;br /&gt;product, stable revenues, well-established profit margins and valuable production facilities.  The process &lt;br /&gt;requires only a few simple assumptions: that something that has been successful will remain so; that next &lt;br /&gt;year’s sales will be equal to this year sales plus some modest growth; and that the profit margin will &lt;br /&gt;remain where it has been for years.  It seems intuitively obvious that chugging along as in the past is &lt;br /&gt;more predictable and reliable than rapid and durable growth, and thus that industrial stalwarts are &lt;br /&gt;more capable than innovators of being valued with precision. &lt;br /&gt;Company B, on the other hand, is at an early stage in its development, its profit margins are far from &lt;br /&gt;maximized, and its greatest assets go home every night rather than residing on the balance sheet.  Valuing &lt;br /&gt;it requires guesses about the ultimate success of its products; its ability to come up with new ones; the &lt;br /&gt;response from competitors and the targeted industry; its growth runway; and the extent to which it will be &lt;br /&gt;able to increase profitability once doing so becomes its focus.  Company B seems more conceptual in &lt;br /&gt;nature and more dependent on developments in the distant future that are subject to significant &lt;br /&gt;uncertainty, so valuing it might have to be done on the basis of broad ranges for future sales and &lt;br /&gt;profitability rather than reliable point estimates.  Assessing its value also requires conversance with a &lt;br /&gt;technologically complex field.  For all these reasons, value investors are likely to consider Company B &lt;br /&gt;hard to value, “speculative” and thus not investable under the canon.   &lt;br /&gt;Certainly, the range of potential outcomes – both good and bad – appears greater with respect to &lt;br /&gt;Company B than Company A, and thus Company B seems less predictable.  But Company A’s track &lt;br /&gt;record may suggest stability that could ultimately prove fleeting.  And even if one can’t exactly predict &lt;br /&gt;the future of Company B, British philosopher and logician Carveth Read reminds us that we’d rather be &lt;br /&gt;vaguely right than exactly wrong.  The ability to formulate precise forecasts does not necessarily make &lt;br /&gt;something a better or even a safer investment.   &lt;br /&gt;•First, the apparent ease of predicting traditional Company A’s future can be quite&lt;br /&gt;deceptive – for example, considerable uncertainty can exist regarding its risk of being disrupted&lt;br /&gt;by technology or seeing its products innovated out of existence.  On the other hand, while&lt;br /&gt;Company B is more nascent, its products’ strength and traction in the marketplace may make&lt;br /&gt;success highly likely.&lt;br /&gt;•Second, as noted earlier, if conclusions regarding Company A’s potential can easily be&lt;br /&gt;reached by a finance student with a laptop, how valuable can such conclusions be?&lt;br /&gt;Shouldn’t a deep understanding of a company’s qualitative dynamics and future potential be a&lt;br /&gt;greater source of advantage in making correct forecasts than data which is readily available to all?&lt;br /&gt;Value investing is thought of as trying to put a precise value on the low-priced securities of possibly &lt;br /&gt;mundane companies and buying if their price is lower.  And growth investing is thought of as buying on &lt;br /&gt;the basis of blue-sky estimates regarding the potential of highly promising companies and paying high &lt;br /&gt;valuations as the price of their potential.  Rather than being defined as one side of this artificial &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dichotomy, value investing should instead consist of buying whatever represents a better value &lt;br /&gt;proposition, taking all factors into account. &lt;br /&gt;Dealing with Winners &lt;br /&gt;A couple of times this past year, I’ve committed the sin of asking Andrew how he felt about selling &lt;br /&gt;part of some highly appreciated holdings and “taking some money off the table.”  The results &lt;br /&gt;haven’t been pretty; he has made plain my error, as described below. &lt;br /&gt;Much of value investing is based on the assumption of “reversion to the mean.”  In other words, &lt;br /&gt;“what goes up must come down” (and what comes down must go up).  Value investors often look &lt;br /&gt;for bargains among the things that have come down.  Their goal, of course, is to buy underpriced &lt;br /&gt;assets and capture the discounts.  But then, by definition, their potential gain is largely limited to the &lt;br /&gt;amount of the discount.  Once they’ve benefitted from the closing of the valuation gap, “the juice is &lt;br /&gt;out of the orange,” so they should sell and move on to the next situation.  &lt;br /&gt;In Graham’s day, cigar butts could be found in good supply, valued precisely, bought very cheaply &lt;br /&gt;with confidence, and then sold once the price had risen to converge with the value.  But Andrew &lt;br /&gt;argues that this isn’t the right way to think about today’s truly world-class companies, with their &lt;br /&gt;vast but unquantifiable long-term potential.  Rather, if an investor has studied a company, reached a &lt;br /&gt;deep understanding of it and concluded that it possesses great potential for growth and profitability, &lt;br /&gt;he’ll probably recognize that it’s impossible to accurately quantify that potential and know when it &lt;br /&gt;has been realized.  He also may realize that ultimate potential is a moving target, as the &lt;br /&gt;company’s strengths may allow it to develop additional avenues of growth.  Thus he might have &lt;br /&gt;to accept that the correct approach is to (a) hope he has the direction and quantum &lt;br /&gt;approximately right, (b) buy and (c) hold on as long as the evidence suggests the thesis is right &lt;br /&gt;and the trend is upward – in other words, as long as there’s still juice in the orange. &lt;br /&gt;My    2015 memo Liquidity included some observations from Andrew regarding point “c”: &lt;br /&gt;When you find an investment with the potential to compound over a long period of time, &lt;br /&gt;one of the hardest things is to be patient and maintain your position as long as doing so is &lt;br /&gt;warranted on the basis of the prospective return and risk.  Investors can easily be moved &lt;br /&gt;to sell by news, emotion, the fact that they’ve made a lot of money to date, or the &lt;br /&gt;excitement of a new, seemingly more promising idea.  When you look at the chart for &lt;br /&gt;something that’s gone up and to the right for 20 years, think about all the times a &lt;br /&gt;holder would have had to convince himself not to sell.  &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t changed his tune one bit over the last five years.  Andrew insists that when you’re &lt;br /&gt;talking about today’s great growth companies, the approach of “buy in cheap, set a target &lt;br /&gt;price, sell as it rises, and exit fully when it reaches the target” is dead wrong.  A dispassionate &lt;br /&gt;look at history makes clear that taking profits in a rapidly growing company with durable &lt;br /&gt;competitive advantages has often been a mistake.  Given the properties of today’s leading &lt;br /&gt;companies, it can be even more wrong now.  Instead, as he says, you have to talk yourself out of &lt;br /&gt;selling.  &lt;br /&gt;I think winners are sold for four primary reasons: (a) the investor concludes that the investment has &lt;br /&gt;accomplished everything it’s capable of, (b) she thinks it has appreciated to the point that its &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prospective return is only modestly attractive, (c) she realizes something in her investment thesis &lt;br /&gt;was incorrect or has changed for the worse or (d) she fears that the gains to date might be proved &lt;br /&gt;unwarranted and thus evaporate; in particular, she’s afraid she’ll end up kicking herself for not &lt;br /&gt;having taken profits while they were there.  But fear of making a mistake is a terrible reason to sell &lt;br /&gt;something of value. &lt;br /&gt;Here’s how Andrew puts it today: &lt;br /&gt;It’s important to understand the paramount importance of compounding, and how rare &lt;br /&gt;and special long-term compounders are.  This is antithetical to the “it’s up, so sell” &lt;br /&gt;mentality but, in my opinion, critical to long-term investment success.  As Charlie &lt;br /&gt;Munger says, “the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.” &lt;br /&gt;In other words, if you have a compounding machine with the potential to do so for &lt;br /&gt;decades, you basically shouldn’t think about selling it (unless, of course, your thesis &lt;br /&gt;becomes less probable).  Compounding at high rates over an investment career is very &lt;br /&gt;hard, but doing it by finding something that doubles, then moving on to another thing that &lt;br /&gt;doubles, and so on and so on is, in my opinion, nearly impossible.  It requires that you &lt;br /&gt;develop correct insights about a large number of investment situations over a long period &lt;br /&gt;of time.  It also requires that you execute well on both the buy and the sell each time.  &lt;br /&gt;When you multiply together the probabilities of succeeding at a large number of &lt;br /&gt;challenging tasks, the probability of doing them all correctly becomes very low.  It’s &lt;br /&gt;much more feasible to have great insights about a small number of potentially huge &lt;br /&gt;winners, recognize how truly rare such insights and winners are, and not counteract them &lt;br /&gt;up by selling prematurely. &lt;br /&gt;As I was working on this memo, I came across a very helpful article from the Santa Fe Institute: &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to investing and businesses, the mental models in our head help us &lt;br /&gt;answer the question, ‘what does the future hold?’. . .  [But] applying the mental &lt;br /&gt;model of ‘mean reversion’ for a ‘fade-defying’ business model will lead to an &lt;br /&gt;erroneous conclusion.  (Investment Master Class, December 21, 2020) &lt;br /&gt;The last sentence struck a very responsive chord in me.  It suggested to me that my background &lt;br /&gt;had biased me toward assuming “mean reversion” and thus sometimes caused me not to fully &lt;br /&gt;grasp the potential of “fade-defying business models.”  This bias caused me to conclude that one &lt;br /&gt;should “scale out” of things as they rose and “take some money off the table.”  I even formulated a &lt;br /&gt;saying on the subject: “If you sell half, you can’t be all wrong.”  But I now see that this high-&lt;br /&gt;sounding verbiage can lead to premature selling, and that cutting back a holding with great potential &lt;br /&gt;can be a life-altering mistake.  Note that, according to Charlie Munger, he’s made almost all his &lt;br /&gt;money from three or four big winners.  What if he had scaled out early? &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, (a) Oaktree’s business consists mostly of garnering valuation discrepancies; (b) because of &lt;br /&gt;their nature, our asset classes offer up relatively few opportunities to err by prematurely selling off &lt;br /&gt;potential mega-multiple winners; (c) Oaktree’s decentralized structure insulates our portfolio managers &lt;br /&gt;from the extremes of my caution; and (d) my colleagues do a better job of letting their winners run than I &lt;br /&gt;might have.  We might have done more if I didn’t have my   limitations.  Maybe I c&lt;br /&gt;ould have remained in &lt;br /&gt;equities, or even become a venture capitalist and seeded Amazon.  But I can’t complain – thing   s couldn’t &lt;br /&gt;have turned out better.   &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Value Mentality in Action &lt;br /&gt;Back in 2017, my memo There They Go Again . . . Again included a section on cryptocurrencies in &lt;br /&gt;which I expressed a high level of skepticism.  This view has been a source of much discussion for me &lt;br /&gt;and Andrew, who is quite positive on Bitcoin and several others and thankfully owns a meaningful &lt;br /&gt;amount for our family.  While the story is far from fully written, the least I can say is that my skeptical &lt;br /&gt;view &lt;br /&gt;has not borne out to date.  This brings up what Andrew considers a very important point about the &lt;br /&gt;value investor’s mentality and what is required for success as an investor in today’s world. &lt;br /&gt;As I  said before, the natural state for the value investor is one of skepticism.  Our default reaction is &lt;br /&gt;t&lt;br /&gt;o be deeply dubious when we hear “this time it’s different,” and we point to a history of speculative &lt;br /&gt;manias and financial innovations that left behind significant carnage.  It’s thi s skepticism that reduces the &lt;br /&gt;value investor’s probability of losing money.  &lt;br /&gt;However, in a world where so much innovation is happening at such a rapid pace, this mindset &lt;br /&gt;should be paired with a deep curiosity, openness to new ideas, and willingness to learn before &lt;br /&gt;forming a view.  The nature of innovation generally is such that, in the beginning, only a few believe in &lt;br /&gt;something that seems absurd when compared to the deeply entrenched status quo.     When innovations &lt;br /&gt;work, it’s  only later that what first seemed crazy becomes consensus.  Without attaining real knowledge &lt;br /&gt;of what’s going on and attempting to fully understand the positive case, it’s impossible to have a &lt;br /&gt;sufficiently informed view to warrant the dismissiveness that many of us exhibit in the face of &lt;br /&gt;innovation.   &lt;br /&gt;In the case of cryptocurrencies, I probably allowed my pattern recognition around financial innovation &lt;br /&gt;and speculative market behavior – along with my natural conservatism – to produce my skeptical &lt;br /&gt;position.  These things have kept Oaktree and me out of trouble many times, but they probably don’t help &lt;br /&gt;me think through innovation.  Thus, I’ve concluded (with Andrew’s help) that I’m not yet informed &lt;br /&gt;enough to form a firm view on cryptocurrencies.  In  the spirit of open-mi&lt;br /&gt;ndedness, I’m striving to learn.  &lt;br /&gt;Until I do, I’ll be referring all requests for comments on the subject to Andrew (although I’m sure he’ll &lt;br /&gt;decline). &lt;br /&gt;Back to the Original Question &lt;br /&gt;I’ll move toward ending this memo by turning to the question I mentioned at the outset: Is the recent &lt;br /&gt;underperformance of value investing a temporary phenomenon?  Will value stocks ever again have their &lt;br /&gt;day in the sun? &lt;br /&gt;First, I think the stocks of the tech leaders are clearly being aided by a virtuous circle created by the &lt;br /&gt;combination of their preeminence as companies, their recent eye-popping performance, their huge market &lt;br /&gt;capitalizations, and the strategic considerations of the fund business.  The companies’ preeminence and &lt;br /&gt;price momentum make them essential cornerstone holdings in many ETFs, and their enormous scale &lt;br /&gt;places them among the largest holdings.  They also dominate equity indices such as the S&amp;P 500.  Those &lt;br /&gt;two things mean that as long as money flows disproportionately into ETFs and index funds and the four &lt;br /&gt;factors enumerated above don’t change, the leading tech stocks will continue to attract more than their &lt;br /&gt;fair share of capital and perform better than stocks not as well represented in the indices and ETFs. &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is one of those trends that will continue until it stops.  To the extent investors’ expectations &lt;br /&gt;for these companies’ rapid growth are realized, they can continue to be great performers.  But at some &lt;br /&gt;point, if they keep appreciating faster than the rest of the stock market, there should come a time when &lt;br /&gt;even their superior growth rates are fully reflected in their stock prices and their performance should &lt;br /&gt;subside: their stock prices may grow “only” in line with their earnings or even slower.  And other stocks &lt;br /&gt;may come into favor and perhaps outperform.  But importantly, there’s no reason why this has to happen &lt;br /&gt;anytime soon. &lt;br /&gt;There are many similarities between today and past periods of optimism.  There’s immense excitement &lt;br /&gt;about investing in high-growth stocks, fueling continued rapid appreciation.  There’s very easy monetary &lt;br /&gt;policy, which adds fuel to the fire in any bull market.  There are pockets of extreme behavior, with 30-40x &lt;br /&gt;sales multiples not uncommon for software businesses, and with high-priced IPOs doubling on their first &lt;br /&gt;trading day.  But there are real differences as well.  We’ve rarely had businesses as dominant as the tech &lt;br /&gt;leaders, with the growth runways they have and the profit margins and capital efficiency they enjoy &lt;br /&gt;making them more dominant with each passing day.  We’ve never seen businesses with the ability to &lt;br /&gt;scale as rapidly and frictionlessly.  We’ve never had such a catalyst for technology adoption as we’ve had &lt;br /&gt;in the coronavirus pandemic.  We’ve had a boom of new public companies coming to market, both &lt;br /&gt;through IPOs and SPACs, reversing the long trend of a shrinkage in the number of public companies. &lt;br /&gt;We’ve never had interest rates as low as they are and as likely to stay low for as long as has been &lt;br /&gt;telegraphed.  The Internet has permeated the world and changed it, and business models have evolved in a &lt;br /&gt;way that makes today’s situation incomparable to the Nifty Fifty or the Dot Com Bubble of the late ’90s &lt;br /&gt;(for example, in 1998 there were 150 million Internet users globally; today there are more than that in &lt;br /&gt;Indonesia alone). &lt;br /&gt;I believe most types of investment are likely to go through periods of both outperformance and &lt;br /&gt;underperformance.  There are reasons to believe (with ample counterarguments) that as the tide turns on &lt;br /&gt;monetary policy (if it ever does), rising interest rates will disproportionately hurt growth stocks, just as &lt;br /&gt;they’ve been disproportionately helped during this period of easy money.  More importantly, it has long &lt;br /&gt;been true that when something works, people follow the herd, chase the gains, and bid it up to the point &lt;br /&gt;where prospective returns are paltry, thus positioning investments that have been out of favor to become &lt;br /&gt;the new outperformers.  But, as I said earlier, broad observations about historic valuations are not a &lt;br /&gt;sufficient foundation for market opinions today.  I also believe, as outlined earlier, that certain types of &lt;br /&gt;value opportunities have largely evaporated and, save for times of market panic when things become &lt;br /&gt;dislocated, are unlikely to deliver the returns they did in the past. &lt;br /&gt;In short, there are arguments for a resurgence in value investing and arguments for its permanent &lt;br /&gt;impairment.  But, I think this debate gives rise to a false and unhelpful narrative.  The value investor of &lt;br /&gt;today should dig in with an open mind and a desire to deeply understand things, knowing that in the &lt;br /&gt;world we live in, there’s likely more to the story than what appears on the Bloomberg screen.  The search &lt;br /&gt;for value in low-priced securities that are worth much more should be just one of many important &lt;br /&gt;tools in a toolbox, not a hammer constantly in search of a nail.  It doesn’t make sense for value &lt;br /&gt;investors to bar investments simply because (a) they involve high-tech companies that are widely &lt;br /&gt;considered to have unusually bright futures, (b) their futures are distant and hard to quantify, and &lt;br /&gt;(c)their potential causes their securities to be assigned valuations that are high relative to the&lt;br /&gt;historic averages.  The goal at the end of the day should be to figure out what all kinds of things are&lt;br /&gt;worth and buy them when they’re available for a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;* *  * &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end, I’ll pull together what I consider the key conclusions: &lt;br /&gt;•Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics.  Value can be found in many&lt;br /&gt;forms.  The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its&lt;br /&gt;success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of&lt;br /&gt;intrinsic value.&lt;br /&gt;•Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number.  As Albert Einstein purportedly&lt;br /&gt;said, “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”&lt;br /&gt;The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.&lt;br /&gt;•Since quantitative information regarding the present is so readily available, success in the highly&lt;br /&gt;competitive field of investing is more likely to be the result of superior judgments about&lt;br /&gt;qualitative factors and future events.&lt;br /&gt;•The fact that a company is expected to grow rapidly doesn’t mean it’s unpredictable, and the fact&lt;br /&gt;that another has a history of steady growth doesn’t mean it can’t run into trouble.&lt;br /&gt;•The fact that a security carries high valuation metrics doesn’t mean it’s overpriced, and the fact&lt;br /&gt;that another has low valuation metrics doesn’t mean it’s a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;•Not all companies that are expected to grow rapidly will do so.  But it’s very hard to fully&lt;br /&gt;appreciate and fully value the ones that will.&lt;br /&gt;•If you find a company with the proverbial license to print money, don’t start selling its shares&lt;br /&gt;simply because they’ve shown some appreciation.  You won’t find many such winners in your&lt;br /&gt;lifetime, and you should get the most out of those you do find.&lt;br /&gt;I once asked a well-known value investor how he could hold the stocks of fast-growing companies like &lt;br /&gt;Amazon – not today, when they’re acknowledged winners, but rather two decades ago.  Hi s answer was &lt;br /&gt;simple: “They looked like value to me.”  I guess the answer is “value is where you find it.” &lt;br /&gt;My conversations with Andrew over the ten months of the pandemic have represented a “voyage of &lt;br /&gt;discovery” and culminated in this memo.  I think we came to some important realizations regarding the &lt;br /&gt;question of value versus growth investing, and in the process, I learned a lot about myself.   &lt;br /&gt;I don’t mean to suggest that anything I’ve written here pertains to all val&lt;br /&gt;ue  or  all growth investors.  &lt;br /&gt;There’s a lot of generalizing, and we know how imperfect generalizations can be.  I also don’t insist that &lt;br /&gt;it’ s correct.  It’ s just the current state of my thinking.  Not only do I not insist that my version is the only &lt;br /&gt;one possible, but    I expect it to evolve further as the wo&lt;br /&gt;rld changes and I continue to learn.  I hope you’ll &lt;br /&gt;find this memo interesting and helpful, and I wish you all the best in 2021. &lt;br /&gt;January 11, 2021 &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.15All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendix:  Dealing with Winners in Practice &lt;br /&gt;The conclusions described above regarding how to deal with winners shouldn’t be taken to mean it was &lt;br /&gt;easy for Andrew and me to reach agreement on this subject.  The discussion here was our most spirited, &lt;br /&gt;and we returned to it many times.  Our talks usually went something like this: &lt;br /&gt;Howard: Hey, I see XYZ is up xx% this year and selling at a p/e ratio of xx.  Are you tempted to take &lt;br /&gt;some profi&lt;br /&gt;ts? &lt;br /&gt;Andrew: Dad, I’ve told you I’m not a seller.  Why would I sell? &lt;br /&gt;H: Well, you might sell some here because (a) you’re up so much, (b) you want to put some of the gain &lt;br /&gt;“in the books” to make sure you don’t give it all back and (c) at that valuation, it might be overvalued and &lt;br /&gt;precarious.  And, of course, (d) no one ever went broke taking a profit. &lt;br /&gt;A: Yeah, but on the other hand, (a) I’m a long-term investor, and I don’t think of shares as piece   s of paper &lt;br /&gt;to trade, but as part ownership in a business, (b) the company still has enormous potential, and (c) I can &lt;br /&gt;live with a short-term downward fluctuation, the threat of which is part of what creates opportunities in &lt;br /&gt;stock   s to begin with.  Ultimately, it’s only the long term that matters.  (There’s a lot of a-b-c in our house. &lt;br /&gt;I wonder where Andrew got that.) &lt;br /&gt;H: But if it’s potentially overvalued in the short term, shouldn’t you trim your holding and pocket some of &lt;br /&gt;the gain?  Then if it goes down, (a) you’ve limited your regret and (b) you can buy in lower. &lt;br /&gt;A: If I owned a stake in a private company with enormous potential, strong momentum and great &lt;br /&gt;management, I would never sell part of it just because someone offered me a full price.  Great &lt;br /&gt;compounders are extremely hard to find, so it’s usually a mistake to let them go.  Also, I think it’s much &lt;br /&gt;mor&lt;br /&gt;e straightforward to predict the long-term outcome for a company than short-term price movements, &lt;br /&gt;and it doesn’t make sense to trade off a decision in an area of high conviction for one about which you’re &lt;br /&gt;limited to low conviction.  &lt;br /&gt;H: Well for one thing, the p/e ratio is awfully high. &lt;br /&gt;A: The p/e ratio is just a very quick heuristic that doesn’t necessarily tell you much about the company.  &lt;br /&gt;You can’t say a stock is overvalued just because its p/e ratio is high relative to historic average p/e’s for &lt;br /&gt;the market.  All that matters is thinking about how much cash flow the company can produce over a long &lt;br /&gt;period &lt;br /&gt;of time, discounting that at a reasonable discount rate, and comparing the resultant present value &lt;br /&gt;against the current price.  There are lots of things – about both the company’s present condition and its &lt;br /&gt;future potential – that don’t get picked up in a p/e ratio, so a high multiple alone shouldn’t scare you off.  &lt;br /&gt;H&lt;br /&gt;: Aha!  That’s just what they said during the Nifty Fifty bubble around the time I started working.  “No &lt;br /&gt;price too high,” was a widespread mantra.  Coca-Cola reached 46x earnings at the height of the bubble in &lt;br /&gt;mid-1972 – 2.4x the p/e on the S&amp;P 500.  From there it fell 65% over the next year and a half.    &lt;br /&gt;A: First, saying a high p/e alone shouldn’t stop you from owning something doesn’t mean there’s no &lt;br /&gt;price too high.  It simply means that no single metric can hold the key to investment decisions, and the &lt;br /&gt;price of something should be weighed against its fundamental potential.  Coke may have been &lt;br /&gt;overvalued in 1972 at its p/e of 46.  In particular, since it dealt in a physical product and required &lt;br /&gt;incremental capital to grow, &lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.16All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it didn’t have potential for exponential growth.  But note that Coke holders did earn a compound return of &lt;br /&gt;16% percent a year for 26 years even if they bought at the 1972 pre-crash high.  So, even without the &lt;br /&gt;growth prospects of today’s best businesses, companies that can compound earnings at high rates can &lt;br /&gt;merit very high p/e ratios.  &lt;br /&gt;H: Aren’t you concerned that if the leading stocks of today go out of style, you could see XYZ down a &lt;br /&gt;third or more? &lt;br /&gt;A: Stocks can go in and out of style, causing their prices to fluctuate wildly.  And when a group is in &lt;br /&gt;vogue, it may be more likely to experience a reversal.  But, at the end of the day, all I care about is this &lt;br /&gt;specific company and its long-term potential which, even when using conservative assumptions, I find to &lt;br /&gt;be immense relative to its current price.  Seeing it fall wouldn’t be fun, but I think selling here and &lt;br /&gt;missing out on part of that future would be far worse.  Some years XYZ may do well, and some years it &lt;br /&gt;may do poorly (even perhaps very poorly).  But if I’m right, I think it has a great long-term future ahead &lt;br /&gt;of it.     The only way to be sure we participate in that future is to hold on throughout.  And, by the way, if &lt;br /&gt;you don’t sell, you get to compound without paying capital gains taxe  s until the end.  &lt;br /&gt;H: You run a concentrated portfolio.  XY Z wa s a big position when you invested, and it’s even bigger &lt;br /&gt;today, given the appreciation.  Intelligent investors &lt;br /&gt;concentrate portfolios and hold on to take advantage &lt;br /&gt;of what they know, but they diversify holdings and sell as things rise to limit the potential damage from &lt;br /&gt;what they don’t know.  Hasn’t the growth in this position put our portfolio out of whack in that regard? &lt;br /&gt;A: Perhaps that’   s true, depending on your goals.  But trimming would mean selling something I feel &lt;br /&gt;immense comfort with based on my bottoms-up assessment and moving into something I feel less good &lt;br /&gt;about or know less well (or cash).  To me, it’s far better to own a small number of things about which I &lt;br /&gt;feel strongly.  I’ll only have a few good insights over my lifetime, so I have to maximize the few I have. &lt;br /&gt;H: Isn’t there any point where you’d begin to sell? &lt;br /&gt;A: In theory there is, but it largely depends on (a) whether the fundamentals are playing out as I hope and &lt;br /&gt;(b)  how this opportunity compares to the others that are available, taking into account my high level of&lt;br /&gt;comfort with this one.&lt;br /&gt;H: If there’s a point at which you’d start to sell, what it is?  Isn’t setting a target price based on intrinsic &lt;br /&gt;value an important part of value investing? &lt;br /&gt;A: This company can’t be valued with a single number – and it’s not a mature company with a fixed value &lt;br /&gt;I’m trying to capture – so I can’t tell you where I’d start to sell.  There are a lot of moving parts; most &lt;br /&gt;importantly, it has very strong management that I believe will continue to leverage the company’s strong &lt;br /&gt;position in the marketplace to develop new avenues of growth.  I can’t say what those will be, or how &lt;br /&gt;they’ll be valued, but I’m confident the team will continue to add value.  Amazon is the classic example; &lt;br /&gt;it created a completely new business out of nothing, AWS, that today accounts for a large percentage of &lt;br /&gt;the company’s total market value.  Selling should be a function of watching how the future develops &lt;br /&gt;relative to your expectations and weighing the opportunity as it stands at any point in time against &lt;br /&gt;whatever else is out there.  &lt;br /&gt;H: Okay.  I’m convinced.  I hope you hold on!&lt;br /&gt;2021 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.17All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   I Beg to Differ &lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________ &lt;br /&gt;I’ ve&lt;br /&gt; w ritten many times about    havin   g joine  d the   investment industry in 1969, when t   he   “Nifty Fifty” &lt;br /&gt;stocks were   in full flowe&lt;br /&gt;r.   My first employer, First N   ational City Bank, as w ell   as  many of the   other &lt;br /&gt;“money-center   banks” (the leading investment managers of t  he d  ay)  , were  enthralled with these &lt;br /&gt;companies, with    their powerful bu siness models and flawless prospects.  Sentiment surrounding their &lt;br /&gt;stocks was  uniformly positive, and portfolio managers foun  d great    safety in numbers.  For example, a &lt;br /&gt;common r efrain at t  he t  ime was “  you c   an’t    be f  ired for buying IBM,” the   era’&lt;br /&gt;s  quintessential growth &lt;br /&gt;company.   &lt;br /&gt;I’ve also   written extensively about    the   fate o   f t hese    stocks.  In 1973-74, t   he O  PEC    oil   embargo and t he &lt;br /&gt;resultant recession took the S &amp;P 500 Index    down a tota  l  of  47%.  And many of  the   Nifty Fifty, for w  hich &lt;br /&gt;it had been   thought that “   no price was  too high,” did far worse, falling from peak   p/e r   atios    of  60-90 to &lt;br /&gt;trough m ultiples in t  he s  ingle    digits.  Thus, their    devotees lost   almost all  of t  heir money i n t he s  tocks of &lt;br /&gt;companies that   “everyone knew” were g   reat  .  This was m  y f irst  chance to s ee w  hat can   happen to as  sets &lt;br /&gt;that ar   e o n w hat I call “ th e pedestal of p opularity.”    &lt;br /&gt;In 1978, I  was    asked to move to the bank’s bond department to start    funds in convertible b onds a  nd, &lt;br /&gt;shortly&lt;br /&gt; thereafter, hig h yield bonds.   Now I was i  nvesting in securities most f  iduciaries considered &lt;br /&gt;“uninvestable” and which practically no o ne knew about, cared about, or deemed desirable . . .  and    I  was &lt;br /&gt;making money steadily and safely.  I quickly recognized that my s   trong performance resulted in &lt;br /&gt;large part f  rom    precisely that fact: I  w&lt;br /&gt;as   investing in  securities that practically no one knew a  bout, &lt;br /&gt;cared about, or deemed desirable.  This    brought home t   h    e key money-making lesson of  the   Efficient &lt;br /&gt;Market Hypothesis, which I had b   ee n introduced to at t he U niversity of  Chicago Business School: If yo u &lt;br /&gt;seek superior investment results,&lt;br /&gt; y ou have to invest in things tha t others haven’t flocked to a  nd caused to &lt;br /&gt;be   fully valued.  In other words, you h ave to do something different. &lt;br /&gt;The    Essential Difference &lt;br /&gt;In 2006, I wrote a memo called Dare to Be Great.  It was mostly about having high aspirations, and it &lt;br /&gt;inclu&lt;br /&gt;ded a r ant a   gainst confor&lt;br /&gt;mit  y and i   nvestment bureaucracy, as w  ell a  s  an   assertion that the r oute to &lt;br /&gt;superior returns by necessity runs    through unconventionality.  The e   lement of  that memo t   hat  people still &lt;br /&gt;talk t   o m e about is  a simpl   e two  -by-two matrix: &lt;br /&gt;Conventional &lt;br /&gt; Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Unconventional &lt;br /&gt;Behavior &lt;br /&gt;Favorable Outcomes    Average good results  Above average results &lt;br /&gt;Unfavorable Outcomes  Average bad results   Below average results &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I explained the situation: &lt;br /&gt;Of course&lt;br /&gt;, it’s not easy and clear-cut, but I think it’s the general situation.  If your &lt;br /&gt;behavior and that of your managers is conventional, you’re likely to get conventional &lt;br /&gt;results –  either good or bad.  Only if the behavior is unconventional is your performance &lt;br /&gt;likely to be unconventional . . . and only if the judgments are superior is your &lt;br /&gt;performance likely to be above average. &lt;br /&gt;The conse&lt;br /&gt;nsus opinion of market participants is baked into market prices.  Thus, if &lt;br /&gt;investors lack insight that is superior to the average of the people who make up the &lt;br /&gt;consensus, they should expect average risk-adjusted performance.   &lt;br /&gt;Many years ha&lt;br /&gt;ve passed since I wrote that memo, and the investing world has gotten a lot more &lt;br /&gt;sophisticated, but the message conveyed by the matrix and the accompanying explanation remains &lt;br /&gt;unchanged.  Talk about simple –  in the memo, I reduced the issue to a single sentence: “This just in: &lt;br /&gt;You can’t take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform.” &lt;br /&gt;The best w&lt;br /&gt;ay to understand this idea is by thinking through a highly logical and almost mathematical &lt;br /&gt;process (greatly simplified, as usual, for illustrative purposes): &lt;br /&gt;•A certai&lt;br /&gt;n (but unascertainable) number of dollars will be made over any given period by all&lt;br /&gt;investors collectively in an individual stock, a given market, or all markets taken together.  That&lt;br /&gt;amount will be a function of (a) how companies or assets fare in fundamental terms (e.g., how&lt;br /&gt;their profits grow or decline) and (b) how people feel about those fundamentals and treat asset&lt;br /&gt;prices.&lt;br /&gt;•On average, all investors will do average.&lt;br /&gt;•If you’re happy doing average, you can simply invest in a broad swath of the assets in question,&lt;br /&gt;buying some of each in proportion to its representation in the relevant universe or index.  By&lt;br /&gt;engaging in average behavior in this way, you’re guaranteed average performance.  (Obviously,&lt;br /&gt;this is the idea behind index funds.)&lt;br /&gt;•If you want to be above average, you have to depart from consensus behavior.  You have to&lt;br /&gt;overweight some securities, asset classes, or markets and underweight others.  In other words,&lt;br /&gt;you have to do something different.&lt;br /&gt;•The challenge lies in the fact that (a) market prices are the result of everyone’s collective thinking&lt;br /&gt;and (b) it’s hard for any individual to consistently figure out when the consensus is wrong and an&lt;br /&gt;asset is priced too high or too low.&lt;br /&gt;•Nevertheless, “active investors” place active bets in an effort to be above average.&lt;br /&gt;oInvestor A decides stocks as a whole are too cheap, and he sells bonds in order to&lt;br /&gt;overweight stocks.  Investor B thinks stocks are too expensive, so she moves to an&lt;br /&gt;underweighting by selling some of her stocks to Investor A and putting the proceeds into&lt;br /&gt;bonds.&lt;br /&gt;oInvestor X decides a certain stock is too cheap and overweights it, buying from investor&lt;br /&gt;Y, who thinks it’s too expensive and therefore wants to underweight it.&lt;br /&gt;•It’s essential to note that in each of the above cases, one investor is right and the other is&lt;br /&gt;wrong.   Now go back to the first bullet point above: Since the total dollars earned by all investors&lt;br /&gt;collectively are fixed in amount, all active bets, taken together, constitute a zero-sum game (or&lt;br /&gt;negative-sum after commissions and other costs).  The investor who’s right earns an above&lt;br /&gt;average return, and by definition the one who’s wrong earns a below average return.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus, every active bet placed in the pursuit of above average returns carries with it the risk&lt;br /&gt;of below average returns.  There’s no way to make an active bet such that you’ll win if it works&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but not lose if it doesn’t.  Financial innovations are often described as offering some version of &lt;br /&gt;this impossible bargain, but they invariably fail to live up to the hype. &lt;br /&gt;•The bottom line of the above is simple: You can’t hope to earn above average returns  if you&lt;br /&gt;don’t place active bets, but if your active bets are wrong, your return will be below average.&lt;br /&gt;Investing s&lt;br /&gt;trikes me as being very much like golf, where playing conditions and the performance of &lt;br /&gt;competitors can change from day to day, as can the placement of the holes.  On some days, one approach &lt;br /&gt;to the course is appropriate, but on other days, different tactics are called for.  To win, you have to either &lt;br /&gt;do a better job than others of selecting your approach or executing on it, or both. &lt;br /&gt;The s   ame is t&lt;br /&gt;rue for investors.  It’s simple: If you hope to distinguish yourself in terms of &lt;br /&gt;performance, you have to depart from the pack.  But,  having departed, the difference will only be &lt;br /&gt;positive if your choice of strategies and tactics is correct and/or  y ou’re able to execute better.   &lt;br /&gt;Second-L evel Thinking &lt;br /&gt;In 2009, whe&lt;br /&gt;n Columbia Business School Publishing was considering whether to publish my book The &lt;br /&gt;Most Important Thing, they asked to see a sample chapter.  As has often been my experience, I sat down &lt;br /&gt;and described a concept I hadn’t previously written about or named.  That description became the book’s &lt;br /&gt;first chapter, addressing one of its most important topics: second-level thinking.  It’s certainly the concept &lt;br /&gt;from the book that people ask me about most often. &lt;br /&gt;The idea of second-level thinking builds on what I wrote in Dare to Be Great.   First, I repeated my view &lt;br /&gt;that success in investing means doing better than others.  All active investors (and certainly money &lt;br /&gt;managers hoping to earn a living) are driven by the pursuit of superior returns. &lt;br /&gt;But that u&lt;br /&gt;niversality also makes beating the market a difficult task.  Millions of people &lt;br /&gt;are competing for each dollar of investment gain.  Who’ll get it?  The person who’s a step &lt;br /&gt;ahead.  In some pursuits, getting up to the front of the pack means more schooling, more &lt;br /&gt;time in the gym or the library, better nutrition, more perspiration, greater stamina or &lt;br /&gt;better equipment.  But in investing, where these things count for less, it calls for more &lt;br /&gt;perceptive thinking . . . at what I call the second level. &lt;br /&gt;The basic i&lt;br /&gt;dea behind second-level thinking is easily summarized: In order to outperform, your &lt;br /&gt;thinking has to be different and better. &lt;br /&gt;Remember,&lt;br /&gt; your goal in investing isn’t to earn average returns; you want to do better &lt;br /&gt;than average.  Thus, your thinking has to be better than that of others –  both more &lt;br /&gt;powerful and at a higher level.  Since other investors may be smart, well informed and &lt;br /&gt;highly computerized, you must find an edge they don’t have.  You must think of &lt;br /&gt;something they haven’t thought of, see things they miss, or bring insight they don’t &lt;br /&gt;possess.  You have to react differently and behave differently.  In short, being right may &lt;br /&gt;be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won’t be sufficient.  You have &lt;br /&gt;to be more right than others . . . which by definition means your thinking has to be &lt;br /&gt;different. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made the case, I went on to distinguish second-level thinkers from those who operate at the first &lt;br /&gt;level:    &lt;br /&gt;Firs  t- level t&lt;br /&gt;hinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad &lt;br /&gt;sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority).  All the first-level thinker needs is &lt;br /&gt;an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning the &lt;br /&gt;stock will go up.” &lt;br /&gt;Second-level&lt;br /&gt; thinking is deep, complex, and convoluted.  The second-level thinker takes &lt;br /&gt;a great many things into account: &lt;br /&gt;•What is the&lt;br /&gt; range of likely future outcomes?&lt;br /&gt;•What outcome do I think will occur?&lt;br /&gt;•What’s the probability I’m right?&lt;br /&gt;•What does the consensus think?&lt;br /&gt;•How does my expectation differ from the consensus?&lt;br /&gt;•How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the&lt;br /&gt;future, and with mine?&lt;br /&gt;•Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?&lt;br /&gt;•What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and&lt;br /&gt;what if I’m right?&lt;br /&gt;The difference&lt;br /&gt; in workload between first-level and second-level thinking is clearly &lt;br /&gt;massive, and the number of people capable of the latter is tiny compared to the number &lt;br /&gt;capable of the former. &lt;br /&gt;First  -level t&lt;br /&gt;hinkers look for simple formulas and easy answers.  Second-level &lt;br /&gt;thinkers know that success in investing is the antithesis of simple. &lt;br /&gt;Speaking about difficulty reminds me of &lt;br /&gt;an important idea    that arose in my discussions with my son &lt;br /&gt;Andrew during the pandemic (described in the memo Something of Value, published in January 2021).  &lt;br /&gt;In  the memo’s  extensive discussion of how    efficient most markets have   become in  recent decades, &lt;br /&gt;Andrew makes a terrific point&lt;br /&gt;:  “Readily available quantitative information with regard to the &lt;br /&gt;present cannot be the source of superior performance.”  After all,   everyone has access to this type &lt;br /&gt;of information – with regard to public U.S. securities, that’s the whole point of  the SEC’s Reg FD (for   fair &lt;br /&gt;disclosure) – and nowadays all investors&lt;br /&gt; should know how to manipulate data and run screens. &lt;br /&gt;So,  then, ho&lt;br /&gt;w&lt;br /&gt; ca n investors who are   intent on o  utperforming hope to reac   h their    goal?  As Andrew and I &lt;br /&gt;said on a podcast where w   e  discussed Something of Value,  the y have to g o beyond readil   y available &lt;br /&gt;quantitative information with regard to the   present.  Instead, their s   uperiorit   y has t   o c ome from an ability &lt;br /&gt;to: &lt;br /&gt;•better underst&lt;br /&gt;and the significance of the published numbers,&lt;br /&gt;•better assess the qualitative aspects of the company, and/or&lt;br /&gt;•better divine the future.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, none of&lt;br /&gt; these things can be determined with certainty, measured empirically, or processed &lt;br /&gt;using surefire formulas.  Unlike present-day quantitative information, there’s no source you can turn to &lt;br /&gt;for easy answers.  They all come down to judgment or insight.  Second-level thinkers who have better &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;judgment are likely to achieve superior returns, and those who are less insightful are likely to generate &lt;br /&gt;inferior performance. &lt;br /&gt;This all le&lt;br /&gt;ads me back to something Charlie Munger told me around the time The Most Important Thing &lt;br /&gt;was published: “It’s not supposed to be easy.  Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.”  Anyone who thinks &lt;br /&gt;there’s a formula for investing that   guarantees succe   ss (and that they can possess it) clearly doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;understand the complex, dynamic,  and competitive nature of the investing process.  The prize for &lt;br /&gt;superior investing can amount to a lot of money.  In the highly competitive investment arena, it simply &lt;br /&gt;can’t be easy to be the one who pockets the extra dollars. &lt;br /&gt;Contrariani&lt;br /&gt;sm  &lt;br /&gt;There’s a&lt;br /&gt; concept in the investing world that’s closely related to being different: contrarianism.  “The &lt;br /&gt;investment herd” refers to the masses of people (or institutions) that drive security prices one way or the &lt;br /&gt;other.  It’s their actions that take asset prices to bull market highs and sometimes bubbles and, in the other &lt;br /&gt;direction, to bear market territory and occasional crashes.  At these extremes, which are invariably &lt;br /&gt;overdone, it’s essential to act in a contrary fashion.   &lt;br /&gt;Joining in the swings described above causes people to own or buy assets at high prices and to sell or fail &lt;br /&gt;to buy at low prices.  For this reason, it can be important to part company with the herd and behave in a &lt;br /&gt;way that’s contrary to the actions of most others.   &lt;br /&gt;Contrariani&lt;br /&gt;sm received its own chapter in The Most Important Thing.  Here’s how I set forth the logic: &lt;br /&gt;•Markets sw&lt;br /&gt;ing dramatically, from bullish to bearish, and from overpriced to&lt;br /&gt;underpriced.&lt;br /&gt;•Their movements are driven by the actions of “the crowd,” “the herd,” and “most&lt;br /&gt;people.”  Bull markets occur because more people want to buy than sell, or the&lt;br /&gt;buyers are more highly motivated than the sellers.  The market rises as people switch&lt;br /&gt;from being sellers to being buyers, and as buyers become even more motivated and&lt;br /&gt;the   sellers less so.  (If buyers didn’t predominate, the market wouldn’t be rising.)&lt;br /&gt;•Market extremes represent inflection points.  These occur when bullishness or&lt;br /&gt;bearishness reaches a maximum.  Figuratively speaking, a top occurs when the last&lt;br /&gt;person who will become a buyer does so.  Since every buyer has joined the bullish&lt;br /&gt;herd by the time the top is reached, bullishness can go no further, and the market is&lt;br /&gt;as high as it can go.  Buying or holding is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;•Since there’s no one left to turn bullish, the market stops going up.  And if the next&lt;br /&gt;day one person switches from buyer to seller, it will start to go down.&lt;br /&gt;•So at the extremes, which are created by what “most people” believe, most&lt;br /&gt;people are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;•Therefore, the key to investment success has to lie in doing the opposite: in&lt;br /&gt;diverging from the crowd.  Those who recognize the errors that others make can&lt;br /&gt;profit enormously from contrarianism.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, if &lt;br /&gt;the extreme highs and lows are excessive and the result of the concerted, mistaken actions &lt;br /&gt;of most investors, then it’s essential to leave the crowd and be a contrarian. &lt;br /&gt;In his 2000 b&lt;br /&gt;ook, Pioneering Portfolio Management, David Swensen, the former chief investment officer &lt;br /&gt;of Yale University, explained why investing institutions are vulnerable to conformity with current &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consensus belief and why they should instead embrace contrarianism.  (For more on Swensen’s approach &lt;br /&gt;to  investing , see “A Case in Point” below.)  He also stressed the importance of building infrastructure that &lt;br /&gt;enables contrarianism to be employed successfully: &lt;br /&gt;Unless insti&lt;br /&gt;tutions maintain contrarian positions through difficult times, the resulting &lt;br /&gt;damage imposes severe financial and reputational costs on the institution. &lt;br /&gt;Casually re&lt;br /&gt;searched, consensus-oriented investment positions provide little prospect for &lt;br /&gt;producing superior results in the intensely competitive investment management world. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,&lt;br /&gt; overcoming the tendency to follow the crowd, while necessary, proves &lt;br /&gt;insufficient to guarantee investment success . . .  While courage to take a different path &lt;br /&gt;enhances chances for success, investors face likely failure unless a thoughtful set of &lt;br /&gt;investment principles undergirds the courage.  &lt;br /&gt;Before I leav&lt;br /&gt;e the subject of contrarianism, I want to make something else very clear.  First-l evel thinkers &lt;br /&gt;– to the extent they’re interested in the concept of contrarianism –  might believe contrarianism means&lt;br /&gt;doing the opposite of what most people are  doing, so selling when the market rises and buying when it&lt;br /&gt;falls.      But this overly simpl   istic definition of contrarianism is unlikely to be of much help   to investors.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the understanding of contrarianism itself    has to take place at a second level.&lt;br /&gt;In The Most Imp&lt;br /&gt;ortant Thing Illuminated, an annotated edition of my book, four professional investors &lt;br /&gt;and academics &lt;br /&gt;provided commentary on what I had written.  My good friend Joel Greenblatt, an &lt;br /&gt;exceptional equity investor, provided a very apt observation regarding knee-jerk contrarianism: “. . . just &lt;br /&gt;because no one else will jump in front of a Mack truck barreling down the highway doesn’t mean that you &lt;br /&gt;should.”  In other words, the mass of investors aren’t wrong all the time, or wrong so dependably that it’s &lt;br /&gt;always right to do the opposite of what they do.  Rather, to be an effective contrarian, you have to figure &lt;br /&gt;out:   &lt;br /&gt;•what the herd is doi&lt;br /&gt;ng;&lt;br /&gt;•why it’s doing it;&lt;br /&gt;•what’s wrong, if anything, with what it’s doing; and&lt;br /&gt;•what you should do about it.&lt;br /&gt;Like the second-level tho&lt;br /&gt;u&lt;br /&gt;g&lt;br /&gt;ht p  r&lt;br /&gt;ocess la&lt;br /&gt;id&lt;br /&gt; out i   n bullet points on page   four, intelligent contrarianism is &lt;br /&gt;deep an&lt;br /&gt;d complex.  It a  mounts to much more than simply doing the  opposite of the  crowd.  Nevertheless, &lt;br /&gt;g&lt;br /&gt;ood i   nvestment decisions made at the b  est   opp  ortunities – at the most   overdone market extremes – &lt;br /&gt;invariably include an   element of c ontrarian thinking. &lt;br /&gt;The Decision to Risk Being Wrong &lt;br /&gt;T&lt;br /&gt;here    are   only so many topics I find worth writing about, and s ince I know I  ’ll   never know  all t  here    is  to &lt;br /&gt;know about them, I return to some from time to time    and add to what I’ve written previously.  Thus, in &lt;br /&gt;2014, I followed up on 2006’s Dare to Be Great with a memo creatively titled Dare to Be Great II.  To &lt;br /&gt;begin,    I  repeated my insistence on the i   mportance of being different: &lt;br /&gt;If your portf&lt;br /&gt;oli&lt;br /&gt;o looks like everyone else’s, you may do well, or you may do poorly, but &lt;br /&gt;you can’t do different.  And being different is absolutely essential if you want a chance at &lt;br /&gt;being superior. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed that with a discussion of the challenges associated with being different: &lt;br /&gt;Most    great&lt;br /&gt; investments begin in discomfort.   The things most people feel good about – &lt;br /&gt;investments where the underlying premise is widely accepted, the recent performance has &lt;br /&gt;been positive, and the outlook is rosy –  are unlikely to be available at bargain prices.  &lt;br /&gt;Rather, bargains are usually found among things that are controversial, that people are &lt;br /&gt;pes simistic about, and that have been performing badly of late. &lt;br /&gt;But then, perha&lt;br /&gt;ps most importantly, I took the idea a step further, moving from daring to be &lt;br /&gt;different to its natural corollary: daring to be wrong.   Most investment books are about how to be &lt;br /&gt;right, not the possibility of being wrong.  And yet, the would-be active investor must understand that &lt;br /&gt;every attempt at success by necessity carries with it the chance for failure.  The two are absolutely &lt;br /&gt;inseparable, as I described at the top of page three. &lt;br /&gt;In a market that is even moderately efficient, everything you do to depart from the consensus in &lt;br /&gt;pursuit of above average returns has the potential to result in below average returns if  your &lt;br /&gt;departure turns out to be a mistake.   Overweighting something versus underweighting it; concentrating &lt;br /&gt;versus diversifying; holding versus selling; hedging versus not hedging –  these are all double-edged &lt;br /&gt;swords.  You gain when you make the right choice and lose when you’re wrong.   &lt;br /&gt;One of my f&lt;br /&gt;avorite sayings came from a pit boss at a Las Vegas casino: “The more you bet, the more you &lt;br /&gt;win when you win.”  Absolutely inarguable.  But the pit boss conveniently omitted the converse: “The &lt;br /&gt;more you bet, the more you lose when you lose.”  Clearly, those two ideas go together. &lt;br /&gt;In a prese&lt;br /&gt;ntation I occasionally make to institutional clients, I employ PowerPoint animation to &lt;br /&gt;graphically portray the essence of this situation:   &lt;br /&gt;•A bubble dro&lt;br /&gt;ps down, containing the words “Try to be right.”  That’s what active investing is all&lt;br /&gt;about.  But then a few more words show up in the bubble: “Run the risk of being wrong.”  The&lt;br /&gt;bottom line is that you simply can’t do the former without also doing the latter.  They’re&lt;br /&gt;inextricably intertwined.&lt;br /&gt;•Then another bubble drops down, with the label “Can’t lose.”  There are can’t-lose strategies in&lt;br /&gt;investing.  If you buy T-bills, you can’t have a negative return.  If you invest in an index fund,&lt;br /&gt;you can’t underperform the index.  But then two more words appear in the second bubble: “Can’t&lt;br /&gt;win.”  People who use can’t-lose strategies by necessity surrender the possibility of winning.  T-&lt;br /&gt;bill investors can’t earn more than the lowest of yields.  Index fund investors can’t outperform.&lt;br /&gt;•And that brings me to the assignment I imagine receiving from unenlightened clients: “Just apply&lt;br /&gt;the first set of words from each bubble: Try to outperform while employing can’t-lose strategies.”&lt;br /&gt;But that combination happens to be unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;The above s&lt;br /&gt;hows that active investing carries a cost that goes beyond commissions and management fees: &lt;br /&gt;heightened risk of inferior performance.  Thus, every investor has to make a conscious decision about &lt;br /&gt;which course to follow.  Pursue superior returns at the risk of coming in behind the pack, or hug &lt;br /&gt;the consensus position and ensure average performance.   It should be clear that you can’t hope to earn &lt;br /&gt;superior returns if you’re unwilling to bear the risk of sub-par results.   &lt;br /&gt;And that brings me to my favorite fortune cookie, which I received with dessert 40-50  years ago.  The &lt;br /&gt;message inside was simple: The cautious seldom err or write great poetry.  In my college classes in &lt;br /&gt;Japanese studies, I learned about the koan, which Oxford Languages defines as “a paradoxical anecdote &lt;br /&gt;or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enlightenment.”  I think of my fortune that way because it raises a question I find paradoxical and    capable &lt;br /&gt;of leading to enlightenment   .  &lt;br /&gt;But    what does the fortune mean?  That you should be cautious, because cautious people seldom make &lt;br /&gt;mistakes?  Or that you shouldn’t be cautious, because cautious people rarely accomplish great things? &lt;br /&gt;The fortune can be read both ways, and both conclusions seem reasonable.  Thus the key question is, &lt;br /&gt;“Which meaning is right for you?”  As   an investor, do you like the idea of  avoiding error, or would you &lt;br /&gt;rather try for superiority?  Which path is more likely to lead to success as you define it, and which is more &lt;br /&gt;feasible for you?  You can follow either path, but clearly not both simultaneously. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, invest&lt;br /&gt;ors&lt;br /&gt; have to answer what should be a very basic question: Will you (a) strive to be above &lt;br /&gt;average, which costs money, is far from sure to work, and can result in your being below average, or (b) &lt;br /&gt;accept average performance –  which helps you reduce  those costs but also means you’ll have to look on &lt;br /&gt;with envy as winners report mouth-watering successes.  Here’s how I put it in Dare to Be Great II: &lt;br /&gt;How much empha&lt;br /&gt;sis should be put on diversifying, avoiding risk, and ensuring against &lt;br /&gt;below-pack performance, and how much on sacrificing these things in the hope of doing &lt;br /&gt;better? &lt;br /&gt;And here’s ho&lt;br /&gt;w I described some of the considerations: &lt;br /&gt;Unconvention&lt;br /&gt;al behavior is the only road to superior investment results, but it isn’t &lt;br /&gt;for everyone.  In addition to superior skill, successful investing requires the ability &lt;br /&gt;to look wrong for a while and survive some mistakes.   Thus each person has to assess &lt;br /&gt;whether he’s temperamentally equipped to do these things and whether his circumstances &lt;br /&gt;– in terms of employers, clients and the impact of other people’s opinions –  will allow it&lt;br /&gt;. . . when the chips are down and the early going makes him look wrong, as it invariably&lt;br /&gt;will.&lt;br /&gt;You can’t have&lt;br /&gt; it both ways.  And as in so many aspects of investing, there’s no right or wrong, only &lt;br /&gt;right or wrong for you.   &lt;br /&gt;A Case in Poi&lt;br /&gt;nt &lt;br /&gt;The aforeme&lt;br /&gt;ntioned David Swensen ran Yale University’s endowment from 1985 until his passing in &lt;br /&gt;2021, an unusual 36-year tenure.  He was a true pioneer, developing what has come to be called “the Yale &lt;br /&gt;Model” or “the Endowment Model.”  He radically reduced Yale’s holdings of public stocks and bonds, &lt;br /&gt;and invested heavily in innovative, illiquid strategies such as hedge funds, venture capital, and private &lt;br /&gt;equity at a time when almost no other institutions were doing so.  He identified managers in those fields &lt;br /&gt;who went on to generate superior results, several of whom earned investment fame.  Yale’s resulting &lt;br /&gt;performance beat almost all other endowments by miles.  In addition, Swensen sent out into the &lt;br /&gt;endowment community a number of disciples who produced enviable performance for other institutions.  &lt;br /&gt;Many endowments emulated Yale’s approach, especially beginning around 2003-04, after these &lt;br /&gt;institutions had been punished by the bursting of the tech/Internet bubble.  But few if any duplicated &lt;br /&gt;Yale’s success.  They did the same things, but not nearly as early or as well. &lt;br /&gt;To sum up all&lt;br /&gt; the above, I’d say Swensen dared to be different.  He did things others didn’t do.  He did &lt;br /&gt;these things long before most others picked up the thread.  He did them to a degree that others didn’t &lt;br /&gt;approach.  And he did them with exceptional skill.  What a great formula for outperformance. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pioneering Portfolio Management, Swensen provided a description of the challenge at the core of &lt;br /&gt;investing –  especially institutional investing.  It’s one of the best paragraphs I’ve ever read and includes a &lt;br /&gt;two -word phrase (which I’ve bolded for emphasis) that for me reads like sheer investment poetry.  I’ve &lt;br /&gt;borrowed it countless times: &lt;br /&gt;. . . Active ma&lt;br /&gt;nagement strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from institutions, &lt;br /&gt;creating a paradox that few can unravel.  Establishing and maintaining an unconventional &lt;br /&gt;investment profile requires acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which &lt;br /&gt;freq  uently appear downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom.   &lt;br /&gt;As with ma&lt;br /&gt;ny great quotes, this one from Swensen says a great deal in just a few words.  Let’s parse its &lt;br /&gt;meaning: &lt;br /&gt;Idiosyncrat&lt;br /&gt;ic –  When all investors love something, it’s likely their buying will render it highly priced.  &lt;br /&gt;When they hate it, their selling will probably cause it to become cheap.  Thus,  it’s   preferable to buy things &lt;br /&gt;most people hate and sell things most people love.  Such    behavior is by definition highly idiosyncratic &lt;br /&gt;(i.e., “eccentric,” “quirky,”  or  “p eculiar”). &lt;br /&gt;Uncomforta&lt;br /&gt;ble –  The mass of investors take the positions they take   for reasons they find convincing.  &lt;br /&gt;We   witness the same developments they do and are impacted by the same news   .  Yet, we realize that   if &lt;br /&gt;we want to be above average, our reaction to those inputs –  and thus our behavior –  should in many &lt;br /&gt;instances be different from that of others.  Regardless of the reasons, if millions of investors are doing A, &lt;br /&gt;it may be quite uncomfortable to do B.   &lt;br /&gt;And if we&lt;br /&gt; do bring ourselves to do B,  our action is unlikely to prove correct right away.  After we’ve sold &lt;br /&gt;a market darling because we think it’s overvalued, its price probably won’t start to drop the next day.  &lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, the hot asset you’ ve sold will keep rising for a while, and sometimes a good while.  As &lt;br /&gt;John Maynard Keynes said, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”  And as &lt;br /&gt;the old adage goes, “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.”  These two &lt;br /&gt;ideas are closely related to another great Keynes quote: “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for &lt;br /&gt;reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.”  Departing from the mainstream can &lt;br /&gt;be embarrassing and painful.   &lt;br /&gt;Uninstitutional behavior from institutions –  We all know what Swensen meant by the word &lt;br /&gt;“institutions”: bureaucratic, hidebound,  conservative,  conventional, risk -averse,  and    ruled by consensus; &lt;br /&gt;in short, unlikely mavericks.  In such settings, the cost of being different and wrong can be viewed as &lt;br /&gt;highly unacceptable relative to the potential benefit from being different and right.  For the people &lt;br /&gt;involved, passing up profitable investments  (errors of omission) poses far less risk than making &lt;br /&gt;investments  that produce losses (errors of commission).  Thus, investing entities that behave &lt;br /&gt;“institutionally” are, by their nature, highly unlikely to engage in    idiosyncratic behavior. &lt;br /&gt;Early in&lt;br /&gt; his time at Yale, Swensen chose to: &lt;br /&gt;•minimize h&lt;br /&gt;oldings of public stocks;&lt;br /&gt;•vastly overweight strategies falling under the heading “alternative investments” (although he&lt;br /&gt;started to do so well before that label was created);&lt;br /&gt;•in so doing, commit a substantial portion of Yale’s endowment to illiquid investments for which&lt;br /&gt;there was no market; and&lt;br /&gt;•hire managers without lengthy track records on the basis of what he perceived to be their&lt;br /&gt;investment acumen.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use his words, these actions probably appeared “downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional &lt;br /&gt;wisdom.”  Swensen’s behavior was certainly idiosyncratic and uninstitutional, but he understood that the &lt;br /&gt;only way to outperform was to risk being wrong, and he accepted that risk with great results. &lt;br /&gt;One   Way to Diverge&lt;br /&gt; from the Pack &lt;br /&gt;To conclude&lt;br /&gt;, I want to describe a recent occurrence.  In mid-June,    we   held the London edition of &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree’s biannual conference, which followed on the heels of the Los Angeles version.  My   assigned &lt;br /&gt;topic at both conferences was the market environment.  I faced a dilemma while preparing for the London &lt;br /&gt;conference, because so much had changed between the two events: On May 19, the S&amp;P 500 was at &lt;br /&gt;roughly 3,900,  but   by June 21 it was at  approximately 3,750,  down almost 4% in roughly a month.  Here &lt;br /&gt;was my issue   :  Should I update my slides, which had become somewhat dated, or reuse the LA slides to &lt;br /&gt;deliver a consistent message to both audiences?   &lt;br /&gt;I decided to use&lt;br /&gt; the LA slides as the jumping-off point for a discussion of how much things had changed &lt;br /&gt;in that short period.  The key segment of my London presentation consisted of a stream-of-consciousness &lt;br /&gt;discussion of the concerns of the day.  I told the attendees that I pay close attention to the questions &lt;br /&gt;people ask most often at any given point in time, as the questions tell me what’s on people’s minds.  And &lt;br /&gt;the questions I’m asked these days overwhelmingly surround: &lt;br /&gt;•the outlook for i&lt;br /&gt;nflation,&lt;br /&gt;•the extent to which the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to bring it under control, and&lt;br /&gt;•whether doing so will produce a soft landing or a recession (and if the latter, how bad).&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards,&lt;br /&gt; I wasn’t completely happy with my remarks, so I rethought them over lunch.  And when it &lt;br /&gt;was time to resume the program, I went up on stage for another two minutes.  Here’s what I said: &lt;br /&gt;All the discuss&lt;br /&gt;ion surrounding inflation, rates,  and recession falls under the same heading: the short term. &lt;br /&gt;And yet: &lt;br /&gt;•We can’t know much about the short-term future (or, I should say, we can’t dependably know&lt;br /&gt;more than the consensus).&lt;br /&gt;•If we have an opinion about the short term, we can’t (or shouldn’t) have much confidence in it.&lt;br /&gt;•If we reach a conclusion, there’s not much we can do about it –  most investors can’t and won’t&lt;br /&gt;meaningfully revamp their portfolios based on such opinions.&lt;br /&gt;•We really shouldn’t care about the short term –  after all, we’re investors, not traders.&lt;br /&gt;I t hink it’s   the   last   point that m  atters most.     The    question is w hether you agree or n  ot. &lt;br /&gt;For e   xample, when asked whether we’re  heading towar   d a r e   cession, my usual answer is t hat w  henever &lt;br /&gt;we’re not   in  a  recession, we’re heading toward one.  The question is when.  I believe we’ll always have &lt;br /&gt;cycles, which means recessions and recoveries will always lie ahead.  Does    the fact that there’s a &lt;br /&gt;recessio&lt;br /&gt;n a head mean we s hould reduce our    investments or   alter    our portfolio allocation?  I  don’t &lt;br /&gt;think so.  Sinc  e 1920, ther e have been   17   recessions as w  ell as o ne Great Depression  , a World War  and &lt;br /&gt;several smaller wars, multiple periods of worry about global cataclysm, and now a pandemic.  And &lt;br /&gt;yet, as I  mentioned in my January memo, Selling Out, the S&amp;P 500    has returned about 10½% a year on &lt;br /&gt;average over t&lt;br /&gt;hat   century-plus.     Would investors&lt;br /&gt; have improved their performance by getting in and out of &lt;br /&gt;the   market to avoid those problem spots  .  .  .  or would doing so have diminished it?    Ever since I &lt;br /&gt;quoted Bill Miller in that memo, I’ve been impressed by his formulation that “it’s time, not timing” that &lt;br /&gt;leads to real &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wealth accumulation.  Thus, most investors would be better off ignoring short-term considerations if they &lt;br /&gt;want to enjoy the benefits of long-term compounding. &lt;br /&gt;Two of the six &lt;br /&gt;tenets of Oaktree’s investment philosophy say (a) we don’t base our investment decisions &lt;br /&gt;on macro forecasts and (b) we’re not market timers.  I told the London audience our main goal is to &lt;br /&gt;buy debt or make loans that will be repaid and to buy interests in companies that will do well and &lt;br /&gt;make money.  None of that has anything to do with the short term.    &lt;br /&gt;From tim&lt;br /&gt;e to time, when we consider it warranted, we do vary our balance between aggressiveness and &lt;br /&gt;defensiveness, primarily by altering the size of our closed-end funds, the pace at which we invest, and the &lt;br /&gt;level of risk we’ll accept.  But we do these things on the basis of current market conditions, not &lt;br /&gt;expectations regarding future events. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone a&lt;br /&gt;t Oaktree has opinions on the short-run phenomena mentioned above.  We just don’t bet &lt;br /&gt;heavily that they’re right.  During our recent meetings with clients in London, Bruce Karsh and I spent a &lt;br /&gt;lot of time discussing the significance of the short-term concerns.  Here’s how he followed up in a note to &lt;br /&gt;me:   &lt;br /&gt;. . . Will thi&lt;br /&gt;ngs be as bad or worse or better than expected?  Unknowable . . . and equally &lt;br /&gt;unknowable how much is priced in, i.e. what the market is truly expecting.  One would &lt;br /&gt;think a recession is priced in, but many analysts say that’s not the case.  This stuff is &lt;br /&gt;hard...!!!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bruce’s co&lt;br /&gt;mment highlights another weakness of having a short-term focus.  Even if we think we know &lt;br /&gt;what’s in store in terms of things like inflation, recessions,  and interest rates, there’s absolutely no way to &lt;br /&gt;know how market prices comport with those expectations.  This is more significant than most people &lt;br /&gt;realize.  If you’ve developed opinions regarding the issues of the day, or have access to those of pundits &lt;br /&gt;you respect, take a look at any asset and ask yourself whether it’s priced rich, cheap, or fair in light of &lt;br /&gt;those views.  That’s what matters when you’re pursuing investments that are reasonably priced.   &lt;br /&gt;The possibility –  or even the fact&lt;br /&gt; –  that    a negative event lies ahead isn’t in itself a reason to reduce &lt;br /&gt;risk;    investors s hould only do so if the event lies ahead and    it  is n’t appropriately reflected in asset &lt;br /&gt;prices.  But, as Bruce says, there’s usually no way to know. &lt;br /&gt;At the begin&lt;br /&gt;ning of&lt;br /&gt; my career, we thought in terms of investing in a stock for five or six years; something &lt;br /&gt;held for less than a year was considered a short-term trade.  One of the biggest changes I’ve witnessed &lt;br /&gt;since then is the incredible shortening of time horizons.  Money managers know their returns in real time, &lt;br /&gt;and many clients are fixated on how their managers did in the most recent quarter.   &lt;br /&gt;No strategy –&lt;br /&gt; and no level of brilliance –  will make every quarter or every year a successful one.  &lt;br /&gt;Strategies become more or less effective as the environment changes and their popularity waxes and &lt;br /&gt;wanes.  In fact, highly disciplined managers who hold most rigorously to a given approach will tend to &lt;br /&gt;report the worst performance when that approach goes out of favor.  Regardless of the appropriateness of &lt;br /&gt;a strategy and the quality of investment decisions, every portfolio and every manager will experience &lt;br /&gt;good and bad quarters and years that have no lasting impact and say nothing about the manager’s ability.  &lt;br /&gt;Often this poor performance will be due to unforeseen and unforeseeable developments.   &lt;br /&gt;Thus, what do&lt;br /&gt;es it mean that someone or something has performed poorly for a while?  No one should &lt;br /&gt;fire managers or change strategies based on short-term results.  Rather than taking capital away from &lt;br /&gt;underperformers, clients should consider increasing their allocations in the spirit of contrarianism (but &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;few do).  I  find it incredibly simple: If you wait    at a bus stop long enough, you’re guaranteed to &lt;br /&gt;catch a bus, but if you run from bus stop to bus stop, you may never catch a bus. &lt;br /&gt;I believe mos&lt;br /&gt;t investors have their eye on the wrong ball.  One quarter’s or one year’s performance is &lt;br /&gt;meaningless at best and a harmful distraction at worst.  But most investment committees still spend the &lt;br /&gt;first hour of every meeting discussing returns in the most recent quarter and the year to date.  If everyone &lt;br /&gt;else is focusing on something that doesn’t matter and ignoring the thing that does, investors can &lt;br /&gt;profitably diverge from the pack by blocking out short-term concerns and maintaining a laser focus &lt;br /&gt;on long-term capital deployment. &lt;br /&gt;A final quote f&lt;br /&gt;rom Pioneering Portfolio Management does a great job of summing up how institutions &lt;br /&gt;can pursue the superior performance most want.  (Its concepts are also relevant to individuals): &lt;br /&gt;Appropriate &lt;br /&gt;investment procedures contribute significantly to investment success, &lt;br /&gt;allowing investors to pursue profitable long-term contrarian investment positions.  By &lt;br /&gt;reducing pressures to produce in the short run, liberated managers gain the freedom to &lt;br /&gt;create portfolios positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by short-term &lt;br /&gt;players.  By encouraging managers to make potentially embarrassing out-of-favor &lt;br /&gt;investments, fiduciaries increase the likelihood of investment success. &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree is &lt;br /&gt;probably in the extreme minority in its relative indifference to macro projections, especially &lt;br /&gt;regarding the short term.  Most investors fuss over expectations regarding short-term phenomena, but I &lt;br /&gt;wonder whether they actually do much about their concerns, and whether it helps.   &lt;br /&gt;Many invest&lt;br /&gt;ors   –  and especially institutions such as pension funds, endowments, insurance &lt;br /&gt;companies, and sovereign wealth funds, all of which are relatively insulated from the risk of sudden &lt;br /&gt;withdrawals –  have the luxury of being able to focus exclusively on the long term . . . if they will &lt;br /&gt;take advantage of it.  Thus, my suggestion to you is to depart from the investment crowd, with its &lt;br /&gt;unhelpful preoccupation with the short term, and to instead join us in focusing on the things that really &lt;br /&gt;matter. &lt;br /&gt;July 26, 2022 &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   The Illusion of&lt;br /&gt; Knowledge &lt;br /&gt;I’ve    been expressing my disregard for forecasts for almost as long as I’ve been writing my memos, &lt;br /&gt;starting with The V&lt;br /&gt;alue of Predictions, or Where’d All This Rain Come From in February 1993.  Over &lt;br /&gt;the years s&lt;br /&gt;ince    then, I’ve explained at length why I’m not interested in forecasts – a few of my favorite &lt;br /&gt;quotes echoing my disdain head the sections below – but I’ve never devoted a memo to explaining why &lt;br /&gt;making helpful macro forecasts is so    difficult.  So here it is.   &lt;br /&gt;Fo od for T  hought &lt;br /&gt;There are two kinds&lt;br /&gt; of forecasters: those who don’t know, and those who don’t know &lt;br /&gt;they don’t know.  &lt;br /&gt;– John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after putting the   finishing touches on I Beg to Differ in July, I attended a lunch with a  number &lt;br /&gt;of  experienced investors, plus a few people from outside the investment industry.  It wasn’t organized &lt;br /&gt;as  a  social&lt;br /&gt; occasion but rather an opportunity for those present to exchange views regarding the &lt;br /&gt;investment environment.   &lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;t o ne po int,   the h   ost po  se d a  series of qu estions: What’s your    expectation regarding inflation?  Will &lt;br /&gt;there be a r   ecession, and if so,  how    bad?     How will t he w ar  in Ukraine end?     What do   you think is g  oing &lt;br /&gt;to happen in Taiwan?  What’s likely to be t  h&lt;br /&gt;e  impact of  the   2022     and ’24 U.S.   elections?  I  listened as a &lt;br /&gt;variety of opinions were e   xpressed.   &lt;br /&gt;Regular readers of m  y memos ca n imagine what w  ent   through my mind: “N   ot one   person in this r  oom    is &lt;br /&gt;an e  xpert o n foreign&lt;br /&gt; a ffairs or p  olitics.  N o one    present has   particular knowledge of these topics, and &lt;br /&gt;certainl y not more   tha n the   average intelligent person who read t   his m  orning’s news.”  None of t  he &lt;br /&gt;thoughts ex&lt;br /&gt;pressed, even on economic matters, seem  ed much more  persuasive than t   he   others, and I was &lt;br /&gt;absolutely convinced&lt;br /&gt; that none  were capable of i mproving investment results.  And that’s the p   oint. &lt;br /&gt;It w  as t  hat   lunch that started me  thinking about writing yet another memo    on the futility of macro &lt;br /&gt;forec   asting.  Soon thereafter a few additional inputs arrived – a  book, a piece i   n Bloomberg Opinion, and &lt;br /&gt;a newspaper article – all of whic   h supported my thesis (or perhaps pl  ayed to my “confirmation bias” – &lt;br /&gt;i.e., t   he t  endency to embrace and interpret new  infor  mation in a manner that   confirms one’s preexisting &lt;br /&gt;views).  Together, th e lunch and t  hes e items in&lt;br /&gt;spired this m  emo’s theme: the reasons why f  orecasts a  re &lt;br /&gt;rarely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;In order to produce something useful – be i  t  in m anufacturing, academia, or even    the   arts    – you  must have &lt;br /&gt;a r eliable process capable of c onverting the   required inputs into the desired output.  Th  e problem, in &lt;br /&gt;short, is  that    I d on’t t   hink    there can be a pr ocess capable of consistently turning the large number of &lt;br /&gt;variables    associated with e  conomies and f  inancial markets (the inputs) into    a useful macro forecast (the &lt;br /&gt;output).      &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Machine &lt;br /&gt;The greate&lt;br /&gt;st enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;– Daniel J. B&lt;br /&gt;oorstin&lt;br /&gt;In my first decade or so working at First National City Bank, a word was in vogue that I haven’t heard in &lt;br /&gt;a long time: econometrics.  This is the practice of looking for relationships within economic data that can &lt;br /&gt;lead to valid forecasts.  Or, to simplify, I’d say econometrics is concerned with building a mathematical &lt;br /&gt;model of an economy.  Econometricians were heard from a great deal in the 1970s, but I don’t believe &lt;br /&gt;they are any longer.  I take that to mean their models didn’t work. &lt;br /&gt;Forecasters&lt;br /&gt; have no choice but to base their judgments on models, be they complex or informal, &lt;br /&gt;mathematical or intuitive.   Models, by definition, consist of assumptions: “If A happens, then B will &lt;br /&gt;happen.”  In other words, relationships and responses.  But for us to willingly employ a model’s output, &lt;br /&gt;we have to believe the model is reliable.  When I think about modeling an economy, my first reaction is to &lt;br /&gt;think about how incredibly complicated it is. &lt;br /&gt;The U.S.&lt;br /&gt;, for example, has a population of around 330 million.  All but the very youngest and perhaps the &lt;br /&gt;very oldest are participants in the economy.  Thus, there are hundreds of millions of consumers, plus &lt;br /&gt;millions of workers, producers, and intermediaries ( many people fall into more than one category).  To &lt;br /&gt;predict the path of the economy, you have to forecast the behavior of these people –  if not for every &lt;br /&gt;participant, then at least for group aggregates.   &lt;br /&gt;A real s&lt;br /&gt;imulation of the U.S. economy would have to deal with billions of interactions or nodes, including &lt;br /&gt;interactions with suppliers, customers, and other market participants around the globe.  Is it possible to do &lt;br /&gt;this?  Is it possible, for example, to predict how consumers will behave (a) if they receive an additional &lt;br /&gt;dollar of income (what will be the “marginal propensity to consume”?); (b) if energy prices rise, &lt;br /&gt;squeezing other household budget categories; (c) if the price for one good rises relative to others (will &lt;br /&gt;there be a “substitution effect”?); or (d) if the geopolitical arena is roiled by events continents away?   &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, &lt;br /&gt;this level of complexity necessitates the frequent use of simplifying assumptions.  For example, it &lt;br /&gt;would make modeling easier to be able to assume that consumers won’t buy B in place of A if B isn’t &lt;br /&gt;either better or cheaper (or both).  And it would help to assume that producers won’t price X below Y if it &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t cost less to produce X than Y.  But what if consumers are attracted to the prestige of B despite (or &lt;br /&gt;even because of) its higher price?  And what if X has been developed by an entrepreneur who’s willing to &lt;br /&gt;lose   money for a few years to gain market share?  Is it possible for a model to anticipate the consumer’s &lt;br /&gt;decision to pay up and the entrepreneur’s decision to make less (or even lose) money? &lt;br /&gt;Further,&lt;br /&gt; a model will have to predict how each group of participants in the economy will behave in a &lt;br /&gt;variety of environments.  But the vagaries are manifold.   For example, consumers may behave one way at &lt;br /&gt;one moment and a different way at another similar moment.  Given the large number of variables &lt;br /&gt;involved, it seems impossible that two “similar” moments will play out exactly the same way, and thus &lt;br /&gt;that we’ll witness the same behavior on the part of participants in the economy.  Among other things, &lt;br /&gt;participants’ behavior will be influenced by their psychology (or should I say their emotions?), and their &lt;br /&gt;psychology can be affected by qualitative, non-economic developments.  How can those be modeled? &lt;br /&gt;How can a mode&lt;br /&gt;l of an economy be comprehensive enough to deal with things that haven’t been seen &lt;br /&gt;before, or haven’t been seen in modern times (meaning under comparable circumstances)?  This is yet &lt;br /&gt;another example of why a model simply can’t replicate something as complex as an economy. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a prime example of this is the Covid-19 pandemic.  It caused much of the world’s economy to &lt;br /&gt;be shut down, turned consumer behavior on its head, and inspired massive government largesse.  What &lt;br /&gt;aspect of a pre-existing model would have enabled it to anticipate the pandemic’s impact?  Yes, we had a &lt;br /&gt;pandemic in 1918, but the circumstances were so different (no iPhones, Zoom calls, etc. ad infinitum) as &lt;br /&gt;to render economic events during that time of little or no relevance to 2020. &lt;br /&gt;In addition &lt;br /&gt;to the matter of complexity and the difficulty of capturing psychological fluctuations and &lt;br /&gt;dynamic processes, think about the limitations that bear on an attempt to predict something that can’t be &lt;br /&gt;expected to remain unchanged.  Shortly after starting on this memo, I received my regular weekly edition &lt;br /&gt;of Morgan Housel’s always-brilliant newsletter.  One of the articles described a number of observations &lt;br /&gt;from other arenas that have relevance to our world of economics and investing.  Here are two, borrowed &lt;br /&gt;from the field of statistics, that I think are pertinent to the discussion of economic models and forecasts &lt;br /&gt;(“Little Ways the World Works,” Morgan Housel, Collaborative Fund, July 20, 2022): &lt;br /&gt;Stationarity:  An assumption that the past is a statistical guide to the future, based on the &lt;br /&gt;idea that the big forces that impact a system don’t change over time.  If you want to know &lt;br /&gt;how tall to build a levee, look at the last 100 years of flood data and assume the next 100 &lt;br /&gt;years will be the same.  Stationarity is a wonderful, science-based concept that works &lt;br /&gt;right up until the moment it doesn’t.  It’s a major driver of what matters in economics and &lt;br /&gt;politics.  [But in our world,] “Things that have never happened before happen all the &lt;br /&gt;time,” says Stanford professor Scott Sagan. &lt;br /&gt;Cromwell’s rule  : Never say something cannot occur . . . .  If something has a one-in-a-&lt;br /&gt;billion chance of being true, and you interact with billions of things during your lifetime, &lt;br /&gt;you are nearly assured to experience some astounding surprises, and should always leave &lt;br /&gt;ope n the possibility of the unthinkable coming true. &lt;br /&gt;Stationarity might be fairly assumed in the realm of the physical sciences.  For example, thanks to the law &lt;br /&gt;of universal gravitation, under given atmospheric conditions, the speed at which an object falls can &lt;br /&gt;always be counted on to accelerate at the same rate.  It always has, and it always will.  But few processes &lt;br /&gt;can be counted on to be stationary in our world, especially given the role played by psychology, emotion, &lt;br /&gt;and human behavior, and their propensity to vary over time. &lt;br /&gt;Take, for e&lt;br /&gt;xample, the relationship between unemployment and inflation.  For roughly the last 60 years, &lt;br /&gt;economists relied on the Phillips curve, which holds that wage inflation will rise as the unemployment &lt;br /&gt;rate declines, because when there are fewer idle workers on the sidelines, employees gain bargaining &lt;br /&gt;power and can successfully negotiate for higher wages.  It was also believed for decades that an &lt;br /&gt;unemployment rate around 5.5%   indicated “full employment.”  But unemployment fell below 5.5% in &lt;br /&gt;March 2015 (and reached a 50-year low of 3.5% in September 2019), yet there was no significant &lt;br /&gt;increase in inflation (in wages or otherwise) until 2021.  So the Phillips curve described an important &lt;br /&gt;relationship that was built into economic models for decades but, seemingly, didn’t apply over much of &lt;br /&gt;the last decade. &lt;br /&gt;Cromwell’&lt;br /&gt;s rule is also relevant.  Unlike in the physical sciences, in markets and economies there’s very &lt;br /&gt;little that absolutely has to happen or definitely can’t happen.  Thus, in my book Mastering the Market &lt;br /&gt;Cycle, I listed seven terms that investors should purge from their vocabularies: “never,” “always,” &lt;br /&gt;“forever,” “can’t,” “won’t,” “will,” and “has to.”  But if it’s true that those words have to be discarded, &lt;br /&gt;then so too must the idea that one can build a model that can dependably predict the macro future.  In &lt;br /&gt;other words, very little is immutable in our world. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unpredictability of behavior is a favorite topic of mine.  Noted physicist Richard Feynman once said, &lt;br /&gt;“Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.”  The rules of physics are reliable &lt;br /&gt;precisely because electrons always do what they’re supposed to do.  They never forget to perform.  They &lt;br /&gt;never rebel.  They never go on strike.  They never innovate.  They never behave in a contrary manner.  &lt;br /&gt;But none of these things is true of the participants in an economy, and for that reason their &lt;br /&gt;behavior is unpredictable.  And if the participants’ behavior is unpredictable, how can the &lt;br /&gt;workings of an economy be modeled? &lt;br /&gt;What we’re ta&lt;br /&gt;lking about here is the future, and there’s simply no way to deal with the future that &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t require the making of assumptions.   Small errors in assumptions regarding the economic &lt;br /&gt;environment and small changes in participants’ behavior can make differences that are highly &lt;br /&gt;problematic.  As mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz famously suggested, “The flapping of &lt;br /&gt;a butterfly’s wings in Brazil could set off a tornado in Texas.” (Historian Niall Ferguson references this &lt;br /&gt;remark in the article I discuss below.) &lt;br /&gt;Thinking &lt;br /&gt;about all the above, can we ever consider a model of an economy to be reliable?  Can a model &lt;br /&gt;replicate reality?  Can it describe the millions of participants and their interactions?  Are the processes it &lt;br /&gt;attempts to model dependable?  Can the processes be reduced to mathematics?  Can mathematics capture &lt;br /&gt;the qualitative nuances of people and their behavior?  Can a model anticipate changes in consumer &lt;br /&gt;preferences, changes in the behavior of businesses, and participants’ reactions to innovation?  In other &lt;br /&gt;words, can we trust its output?   &lt;br /&gt;Clearly, eco&lt;br /&gt;nomic relationships aren’t hard-wired, and economies aren’t governed by schematic diagrams &lt;br /&gt;(which models try to simulate).  Thus, for me, the bottom line is that the output from a model may &lt;br /&gt;point in the right direction much of the time, when the assumptions aren’t violated.  But it can’t &lt;br /&gt;always be accurate, especially at critical moments such as inflection points . . . and that’s when &lt;br /&gt;accurate predictions would be most valuable.   &lt;br /&gt;The Inputs &lt;br /&gt;No amount of&lt;br /&gt; sophistication is going to allay the fact that all of your knowledge is about &lt;br /&gt;the past and all your decisions are about the future.  &lt;br /&gt;– Ian H. Wils&lt;br /&gt;on (former GE executive)&lt;br /&gt;Having consi&lt;br /&gt;dered the incredible complexity of an economy and the need to make simplifying &lt;br /&gt;assumptions that decrease any economic model’s accuracy, let’s now think about the inputs a model &lt;br /&gt;requires –  the raw materials from which forecasts are manufactured.  Will the estimated inputs prove &lt;br /&gt;valid?  Can we know enough about them for the resulting forecast to be meaningful?  Or will we simply &lt;br /&gt;be reminded of the ultimate truth about models: “garbage in, garbage out”?  Clearly, no forecast can &lt;br /&gt;be better than the inputs on which it’s based.   &lt;br /&gt;Here’s wh&lt;br /&gt;at Niall Ferguson wrote in Bloomberg Opinion on July 17: &lt;br /&gt;Consider for  a  moment what    we are  implicitly asking when    we pose   the  question: Has   &lt;br /&gt;inflation peaked?   We   are  not only   asking about   the  supply of and   demand for &lt;br /&gt;94,000 different commodities, manufactures and    services.   We are  also  asking about  the  &lt;br /&gt;future path   of interest rates   set  by the  Fed,    which –  despite the  much   -vaunted policy of &lt;br /&gt;“forward guidance” –  is  far  from   certain.   We are  asking about    how   long  the  strength of &lt;br /&gt;the  dollar will   be sustained, as it  is  currently holding down the  price    of U.S.    imports. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  there’s more.   We   are  at  the  same    time   implicitly asking how long   the  war   in Ukraine &lt;br /&gt;will   last,   as the  disruption caused since    February by the  Russian invasion has   &lt;br /&gt;significantly exacerbated energy and   food  price    inflation.   We   are  asking whether oil -&lt;br /&gt;producing countries such   as Saudi   Arabia will   respond to pleas  from   Western &lt;br /&gt;governments to pump more    crude. . . . &lt;br /&gt;We   should probably also   ask  ourselves what    the  impact on Western labor  markets will   be &lt;br /&gt;of   the  latest Covid omicron sub  -variant, BA.5.  UK   data   indicate that   BA.5    is  35%  more   &lt;br /&gt;transmissible than   its  predecessor BA.2, which in turn   was   over    20%   more    transmissible &lt;br /&gt;than    the  original omicron. &lt;br /&gt;Good   luck   adding all  those    variables to  your   model.   It is  in fact   just  as  impossible to be &lt;br /&gt;sure   about   the  future path   of inflation as it is  to  be sure   about    the  future path   of the  war   in &lt;br /&gt;Ukraine and   the  future path   of the  Covid pandemic. &lt;br /&gt;I found Ferguson’s article so relevant to the subject of this    memo that I’m including a link to it here.     It &lt;br /&gt;makes a l  ot  of i  mportant points, although I b eg   to differ in one regard.  Fer  gu son s   ays   above, “It  is  in  fact &lt;br /&gt;just    as  impossible to  be   sure    about the   future path    of  inflation as  it  is  to  be   sure    about the   future path    of &lt;br /&gt;the   war in  Ukraine and    the   future path    of  the   Covid pandemic.”  I think accurately predicting inflation is &lt;br /&gt;“more impossible” (if  there    is&lt;br /&gt; such    a thing) than    predicting the outcomes of  the   other     two,    since    doing so &lt;br /&gt;requires being right    about both    of  those outcomes and    a thousand other things.  How    can   anyone possibly &lt;br /&gt;get   a&lt;br /&gt;ll  these things right? &lt;br /&gt;Here’s m y rough description of t  he f  orecasting process from The Value of Predictions: &lt;br /&gt;I imagine that &lt;br /&gt;for most money managers, the process goes like this: “I predict the &lt;br /&gt;economy will do A.  If A happens, interest rates should do B.  With interest rates of B, &lt;br /&gt;the stock market should do C.  Under that environment, the best performing sector should &lt;br /&gt;be D, and stock E should rise the most.”  The portfolio expected to do best under that &lt;br /&gt;scenario is then assembled. &lt;br /&gt;But how likely &lt;br /&gt;is E anyway?  Remember that E is conditioned on A, B, C and D.  Being &lt;br /&gt;right two-thirds of the time would be a great accomplishment in the world of forecasting.  &lt;br /&gt;But if each of the five predictions has a 67% chance of being right, then there is a 13% &lt;br /&gt;probability that all five will be correct and that the stock will perform as expected.   &lt;br /&gt;Predicting event E  on the basis of  assumptions concerning A, B, C and    D is what I call single-&lt;br /&gt;scenario forecasting.  &lt;br /&gt;In other words, if what was assumed regarding A, B, C  or   D turns out to have &lt;br /&gt;been    erroneous, the forecasted outcome for E is unlikely to materialize.  All    of  the   underlying forecasts &lt;br /&gt;have    to be   right in or&lt;br /&gt;der   for E to turn out as predicted, and that’s highly improbable.  No  one can invest &lt;br /&gt;intelligently without considering (a)  the   other possible outcomes for e  ac h element, (b) t  he l ikelihood of &lt;br /&gt;these alternative scenarios, (c) w  hat w  ould have to happen for one of t  hem   to be    the a   ctual    outcome, and &lt;br /&gt;(d)   what  the i   mpact on E would    be.&lt;br /&gt;Ferguson’s article raises an interesting question about economic modeling:  What’s to  be a  s    sumed &lt;br /&gt;regarding the general macro environment under  which economic participants will    operate?  Doesn’t this &lt;br /&gt;question indicate an insoluble feedback loop: To p redict the overall performan   ce of t  he e  conomy, &lt;br /&gt;we need to m ake    assumptions about, for example, consumer behavior.  But t   o  predict consumer &lt;br /&gt;behavior, d&lt;br /&gt;on’t we need to make assumptions regarding the overall economic environment? &lt;br /&gt;In Nobody Knows II (March 2020), my first memo of the pandemic, I mentioned that    in a discussion of &lt;br /&gt;the c   oronavirus, Harvard epidemiologist Marc   Lipsitch had s  aid   there     are (a) facts,   (b) informed &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extrapolations from analogies to other viruses, and (c) opinion or speculation.  This is standard fare when &lt;br /&gt;we deal with uncertain events.  In the case of economic or market forecasts, we have a vast trove of &lt;br /&gt;history and lots of analogous past events from which to extrapolate (neither of which was the case with &lt;br /&gt;Covid-19).  But even when these things are used as inputs for a well-constructed forecasting machine, &lt;br /&gt;they’re still highly unlikely to be predictive of the future.  They may be useful fodder, or they may be &lt;br /&gt;garbage.   &lt;br /&gt;To illustrat&lt;br /&gt;e, people often ask me which of the past cycles I’ve experienced was most like this one.  My &lt;br /&gt;answer is that current developments bear a passing resemblance to some past cycles, but there is no &lt;br /&gt;absolute parallel.  The differences are profound in every case and outweigh the similarities.  And &lt;br /&gt;even if we could find an identical prior period, how much reliance should we put on a sample size of &lt;br /&gt;one?  I’d say not much.  Investors rely on historical references (and the forecasts they foster) &lt;br /&gt;because they fear that without them they’d be flying blind.  But that doesn’t make them reliable. &lt;br /&gt;Unpredictab&lt;br /&gt;le Influences &lt;br /&gt;Forecasts crea&lt;br /&gt;te the mirage that the future is knowable. &lt;br /&gt;– Peter   Bernstein&lt;br /&gt;We can’t con&lt;br /&gt;sider the reasonableness of forecasting without first deciding whether we think our &lt;br /&gt;world is one of order or of randomness.   Put simply, is it entirely predictable, entirely unpredictable, or &lt;br /&gt;something in between?  The bottom line for me is that it’s in between, but unpredictable enough that most &lt;br /&gt;forecasts are unhelpful.  And since our world is predictable at some times and unpredictable at others, &lt;br /&gt;what good are forecasts if we can’t tell which is which?  &lt;br /&gt;I learned a ne&lt;br /&gt;w word from reading Ferguson’s article: “deterministic.”  It’s defined by Oxford Languages &lt;br /&gt;as “ causally determined by preceding events or natural laws.”  The world is much simpler when we deal &lt;br /&gt;with things that function according to rules . . . like Feynman’s electrons.  But, clearly, economies and &lt;br /&gt;markets aren’t governed by natural laws –  thanks to the involvement of people –  and preceding events &lt;br /&gt;may “set the stage” or “tend to repeat,” but events rarely unfold in the same way twice.  Thus, I believe &lt;br /&gt;the processes that constitute the operation of economies and markets aren’t deterministic, meaning they &lt;br /&gt;aren’t predictable. &lt;br /&gt;Further, the   inputs clearly    are u   ndependable.  Many are subject to  randomness, such as weather, &lt;br /&gt;eart  h&lt;br /&gt;quakes, accidents, and deaths.  Others i  nvolve political and geopolitical issues – ones we’r e aware of &lt;br /&gt;and ones  that haven’t yet  surfaced.   &lt;br /&gt;In his Bloomberg Opinion article, Ferguson mentioned the English writer G. K. Chesterton.  That &lt;br /&gt;reminded me to include a Chesterton quote that I used in Risk Revisited Again (June 2015): &lt;br /&gt;The real tr&lt;br /&gt;ouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even &lt;br /&gt;that   it is a reasonable one.  The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, &lt;br /&gt;but not quite.  Life is not an illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians.  It looks just a little &lt;br /&gt;more mathematical and regular than it is; its exactitude is obvious, but its &lt;br /&gt;inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait.   (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;Going back to the lunch described on page one, the host opened the proceedings roughly as follows: “In &lt;br /&gt;recent years, we’ve experienced the Covid-19 pandemic, the surprising success of the Fed’s rescue &lt;br /&gt;actions, and the invasion of Ukraine.  This has been a very challenging environment, since all of these &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;developments arrived out of the blue.”  I imagine the implication for him was that the attendees should let &lt;br /&gt;themselves off the hook for the inaccuracy of their 2020-22 forecasts and go back to work predicting &lt;br /&gt;future events and betting on their judgments.  But my reaction was quite different: “The list of events that &lt;br /&gt;shaped the current environment is quite extensive.   Doesn’t the fact that no one was able to predict any &lt;br /&gt;of them convince those present that they should give up on forecasting?”  &lt;br /&gt;For another exam&lt;br /&gt;ple, let’s think back to the fall of 2016.  There were two things that almost everyone was &lt;br /&gt;sure of: (a) Hillary Clinton would be elected president and (b) if for some reason Donald Trump were &lt;br /&gt;elected instead, the markets would tank.  Nonetheless, Trump won, and the markets soared.  The impact &lt;br /&gt;on the economy and markets over the last six years was profound, and I’m confident no forecast that &lt;br /&gt;took a conventional view of the coming 2016 election got the period since then correct.  Again, &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t that be enough to convince people that (a) we don’t know what’s going to happen and (b) we &lt;br /&gt;don’t know how the markets will react to what happens? &lt;br /&gt;Do Forecasts Add   Value? &lt;br /&gt;It ain’t wha&lt;br /&gt;t you don’t know that gets you into trouble.  It’s what you know for sure that &lt;br /&gt;just ain’t so. &lt;br /&gt;– Mark Twain&lt;br /&gt;As   I mentioned in  my   recent memo Thinking About Macro, in  the   1970s we   used    to  describe an &lt;br /&gt;economist as “a  portfolio manager who  never    marks to market.”   In other    words, economists make    &lt;br /&gt;forecasts; events prove them   either    wrong or right;    they   go on to make    new  forecasts; but  they   don’t    keep   &lt;br /&gt;track    of how   often    they   get   it  right    (or  they   don’t    publish the  stats). &lt;br /&gt;Can   you    imagine hiring a  money manager (or  being    hired, if  you    are  a  money manager) without reference &lt;br /&gt;to  a  track    record?   And   yet,   economists and   strategists stay   in business, presumably because there    are  &lt;br /&gt;customers for  their    forecasts, despite there   being    no published records. &lt;br /&gt;Are   you a  consumer of forecasts?   Are   there   forecasters and   economists on staff    where you    work?   Or do &lt;br /&gt;you     to their    publications and   invite    them   in for  briefings, as was   the  case    with   my previous &lt;br /&gt;employers?   If  so,   do you    know   how   often    each   has  been   right?   Have you found a  way   to rigorously &lt;br /&gt;determine which ones    to rely   on   and   which to ignore?   Is there    a  way   to  quantify their    contributions to &lt;br /&gt;your   investment returns?   I  ask  because I’ve   never    seen   or heard    of any   research along    these   lines.      The   &lt;br /&gt;world seems incredibly  short    on information regarding the  value    added by macro forecasts, especially &lt;br /&gt;given the  large    number of people involved in  this   pursuit. &lt;br /&gt;Despite the l&lt;br /&gt;ack of evidence regarding its value, macro forecasting goes on.  Many of the forecasters are &lt;br /&gt;part of teams managing equity funds, or they provide advice and forecasts to those teams.  What    we know &lt;br /&gt;for sure is that actively managed equity funds have been losing market share to index funds and other &lt;br /&gt;passive vehicles for decades due to the poor performance of active management,  and   as a result,  actively &lt;br /&gt;managed funds now account for less than half of the capital in U.S. equity mutual funds.  Could the &lt;br /&gt;unhelpful nature of macro forecasts be part of the reason? &lt;br /&gt;The  only   place  I  know   to look  for  quantification regarding this   issue    is  the  performance of so-called &lt;br /&gt;macro hedge funds.   Hedge Fund    Research (HFR) publishes broad    hedge fund   performance indices as  &lt;br /&gt;well    as a  number of sub -indices.   Below is the  long -term  p erformance of a  broad hedge fund   index, a &lt;br /&gt;macro fund   sub -index, and   the  Standard &amp;   Poor’s 500  Index.  &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFRI Hedge Fund &lt;br /&gt;Index* &lt;br /&gt;HFRI Macro (Total) &lt;br /&gt;Index &lt;br /&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index &lt;br /&gt;5-year annualized return*5.2% 5.0% 12.8% &lt;br /&gt;10-year annualized return* 5.1 2.8 13.8 &lt;br /&gt;* Performance through July   31,   2022.     The  broad hedge fund   index    shown is  the  Fund    Weighted&lt;br /&gt;Composite Index.&lt;br /&gt;What the &lt;br /&gt;table above shows is that, according to HFR, the average hedge fund woefully underperformed &lt;br /&gt;the S&amp;P 500 in the period under study, and the average macro fund did considerably worse (especially in &lt;br /&gt;the period from 2012 to 2017).  Given that investors continue to entrust roughly $4.5 trillion of capital to &lt;br /&gt;hedge funds, they must deliver some benefit other than returns, but it’s not obvious what that could be.  &lt;br /&gt;This seems to be especially true for the macro funds. &lt;br /&gt;To support&lt;br /&gt; my opinion regarding forecasts, I’ll cite a rare example of self-assessment: a seven-page &lt;br /&gt;feature that appeared in the Sunday Opinion section of The New York Times on July 24 titled “I Was &lt;br /&gt;Wrong.”  In it, eight Times opinion writers opened up about incorrect predictions they made and flawed &lt;br /&gt;advice they had given.  The most relevant here is Paul Krugman, who wrote a confession titled “I Was &lt;br /&gt;Wrong About Inflation.”  I’ll string together some excerpts: &lt;br /&gt;In early &lt;br /&gt;2021, there was an intense debate among economists about the likely &lt;br /&gt;consequences of the American Rescue Plan . . . .  I was on [the side that was less &lt;br /&gt;concerned about the impact on inflation].  As it turned out, of course, that was a very bad &lt;br /&gt;call. . . .   &lt;br /&gt;. . . his&lt;br /&gt;tory wouldn’t have led us to expect this much inflation from overheating.  So &lt;br /&gt;something was wrong with my model . . . .  One possibility is that history was &lt;br /&gt;misleading . . . .  Also, disruptions associated with adjusting to the pandemic and its &lt;br /&gt;aftermath may still be playing a large role.  And of course both Russia’s invasion of &lt;br /&gt;Ukraine and China’s lockdown of major cities have added a whole new level of &lt;br /&gt;disruption. . . . &lt;br /&gt;In any case, t&lt;br /&gt;he whole experience has been a lesson in humility.  Nobody will believe &lt;br /&gt;this, but in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, standard economic models performed pretty &lt;br /&gt;well, and I felt comfortable applying these models in 2021.  But in retrospect I should &lt;br /&gt;have realized that in the face of the new world created by Covid-19, that kind of &lt;br /&gt;extrapolation wasn’t a safe bet.  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;I salute Kr&lt;br /&gt;ugman for this incredible bout of candor (although I have to say I don’t remember a lot of &lt;br /&gt;2009 -10 market forecasts that were optimistic enough to capture the reality of the subsequent decade).  &lt;br /&gt;Krugman’s explanation for his error is fine as far as it goes, but I don’t see any mention of &lt;br /&gt;abstaining from modeling, extrapolating, or forecasting in the future.  &lt;br /&gt;Humility m&lt;br /&gt;ay even be seeping into one of the world’s biggest producers of economic forecasts, the U.S. &lt;br /&gt;Federal Reserve, home of more than 400 Ph.D. economists.  Here’s what economist Gary Shilling wrote &lt;br /&gt;in Bloomberg Opinion on August 22: &lt;br /&gt;The    Federal Reserve’s forward guidance program has been a disaster, so much so that it &lt;br /&gt;has strained the central bank’s credibility.  Chair Jerome Powell seems to agree that &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;providing estimates of where the Fed sees interest rates, economic growth and inflation at &lt;br /&gt;different points in the future should be junked. . . . &lt;br /&gt;The basic problem with forward guidance is that it depends on data that the Fed &lt;br /&gt;had a miserable record of forecasting.   It was consistently too optimistic about an &lt;br /&gt;economic recovery after the 2007-2009 Great Recession.  In September 2014, policy &lt;br /&gt;makers forecast real gross domestic product growth in 2015 of 3.40% but were forced to &lt;br /&gt;constantly crank their expectations down to 2.10% by September 2015. &lt;br /&gt;The federal funds rate is not a market-determined interest rate but is set and &lt;br /&gt;controlled by the Fed, and nobody challenges the central bank.  Yet the FOMC &lt;br /&gt;members were infamously terrible at forecasting what they themselves would do . . .    &lt;br /&gt;In 2015, their average projection of the 2016 federal funds rate was 0.90% and 3.30% in &lt;br /&gt;2019.  The actual numbers were 0.38% and 2.38%. . . . &lt;br /&gt;To be sure, many current events today have caused uncertainty in markets, but the Fed &lt;br /&gt;has been in there hot and heavy with its forward guidance.  Recall that early this year the &lt;br /&gt;central bank believed that inflation caused by frictions in reopening the economy after the &lt;br /&gt;pandemic and supply-chain disruptions was temporary.  Only belatedly did it reverse &lt;br /&gt;gears, raise rates and signal that further substantial hikes are coming.  Faulty Fed &lt;br /&gt;forecasts resulted in faulty forward guidance and increased financial market volatility. &lt;br /&gt;(Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;Lastly on th&lt;br /&gt;is subject, where are the people who’ve gotten famous (and rich) by profiting from macro &lt;br /&gt;views?  I certainly don’t know everyone in the investment world, but among the people I do know or am &lt;br /&gt;aware of, there are only a few highly successful “macro investors.”  When the number of instances of &lt;br /&gt;something is tiny, it’s an indication, as my mother used to say, that they’re “the exceptions that prove the &lt;br /&gt;rule.”  The rule in this case is that macro forecasts rarely lead to exceptional performance.  For me, &lt;br /&gt;the exceptionalness of the success stories proves the general truth of that assertion. &lt;br /&gt;Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;s’ Need to Predict &lt;br /&gt;Forecasts us&lt;br /&gt;ually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future. &lt;br /&gt;– Warren Buffet&lt;br /&gt;t&lt;br /&gt;How many peo&lt;br /&gt;ple are capable of making macro forecasts that are valuable most of the time?  Not many, I &lt;br /&gt;think.  And how many investment managers, economists,  and forecasters try?  Thousands, at a minimum.  &lt;br /&gt;That raises an interesting question: why?  If macro forecasts don’t add to investment success over time, &lt;br /&gt;why do so many members of the investment management industry espouse belief in forecasts and pursue &lt;br /&gt;them?  I think the reasons probably center on these: &lt;br /&gt;•It’s part of t&lt;br /&gt;he job.&lt;br /&gt;•Investors have always done it.&lt;br /&gt;•Everyone I know does it, especially my competitors.&lt;br /&gt;•I’ve always done it –  I can’t quit now.&lt;br /&gt;•If I don’t do it, I won’t be able to attract clients.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Since investing consists of positioning capital to benefit from future events, how can anyone&lt;br /&gt;expect to do a good job without a view regarding what those events will be?  We need forecasts,&lt;br /&gt;even if they’re imperfect.&lt;br /&gt;This summe&lt;br /&gt;r, at the suggestion of my son Andrew, I read an extremely interesting book: Mistakes Were &lt;br /&gt;Made (but Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts, written by &lt;br /&gt;psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson.  Its topic is self-justification.  The authors explain that &lt;br /&gt;“cognitive dissonance” arises when people are confronted with new evidence that calls into question &lt;br /&gt;their pre-existing positions and that when it does, unconscious mechanisms enable them to justify &lt;br /&gt;and uphold those positions.  Here are some selected quotes: &lt;br /&gt;If you hold a se&lt;br /&gt;t of beliefs that guide your practice and you learn that some of them are &lt;br /&gt;incorrect, you must either admit you were wrong and change your approach or reject the &lt;br /&gt;new evidence.  &lt;br /&gt;Most people,&lt;br /&gt; when directly confronted by evidence that they are wrong, do not change &lt;br /&gt;their point of view or plan of action but justify it even more tenaciously.   &lt;br /&gt;Once we ar&lt;br /&gt;e invested in a belief and have justified its wisdom, changing our minds is &lt;br /&gt;literally hard work.  It’s much easier to slot that new evidence into an existing framework &lt;br /&gt;and do the mental justification to keep it there than it is to change the framework.  &lt;br /&gt;The mechani&lt;br /&gt;sms that people generally employ when responding to evidence that throws their beliefs into &lt;br /&gt;doubt include these (paraphrasing the authors’ words): &lt;br /&gt;•an unwilli&lt;br /&gt;ngness to heed dissonant information;&lt;br /&gt;•selectively remembering parts of their lives, focusing on those parts that support their own points&lt;br /&gt;of view; and&lt;br /&gt;•operating under cognitive biases that ensure people see what they want to see and seek&lt;br /&gt;confirmation of what they already believe.&lt;br /&gt;I have litt&lt;br /&gt;le doubt that these are among the factors that cause and enable people to continue making and &lt;br /&gt;consuming forecasts.  What specific form might they take in this case? &lt;br /&gt;•thinking of macr&lt;br /&gt;o forecasts as an indispensable part of investing;&lt;br /&gt;•pleasantly recalling correct forecasts, especially any that were bold and non-consensus;&lt;br /&gt;•overestimating how often forecasts were right;&lt;br /&gt;•forgetting or minimizing the ones that were wrong;&lt;br /&gt;•not keeping records regarding forecasts’ accuracy or failing to calculate a batting average;&lt;br /&gt;•focusing on the “pot of gold” that will reward correct forecasts in the future;&lt;br /&gt;•saying “everyone does it”; and&lt;br /&gt;•perhaps most importantly, blaming unsuccessful forecasts on having been blindsided by random&lt;br /&gt;occurrences or exogenous events.  (But, as I said earlier, that’s the point: Why make forecasts if&lt;br /&gt;they’re so easily rendered inaccurate?)&lt;br /&gt;Most people –&lt;br /&gt; even honest people with good intentions –  take positions or actions that are in their own &lt;br /&gt;interests, sometimes at the expense of others or of objective truth.  They don’t know they’re doing it; they &lt;br /&gt;think it’s the right thing; and they have tons of justification.  As Charlie Munger often says, quoting &lt;br /&gt;Demosthenes, “Nothing is easier than self-deceit.  For what every man wishes, that he also believes to be &lt;br /&gt;true .”   &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t thi&lt;br /&gt;nk of forecasters as crooks or charlatans.  Most are bright, educated people who think they’re &lt;br /&gt;doing something useful.  But self-interest causes them to act in a certain way, and self-justification &lt;br /&gt;enables them to stick with it in the face of evidence to the contrary.  As Morgan Housel put it in a &lt;br /&gt;recent newsletter: &lt;br /&gt;The  inability to forecast the  past   has  no impact on our   desire to forecast the  future. &lt;br /&gt;Certainty is so valuable that we’ll never give up the quest for it, and most people couldn’t &lt;br /&gt;get out of bed in the morning if they were honest about how uncertain the future is.   (“Big &lt;br /&gt;Beliefs,” Collaborative Fund, August 24, 2022) &lt;br /&gt;For my bi&lt;br /&gt;rthday several years ago, my Oaktree co-founder Richard Masson gave me one of his typical &lt;br /&gt;quirky gifts.  In this case, it consisted of some bound copies of The New York Times.  I’ve been waiting &lt;br /&gt;for an opportunity to write about my favorite sub-headline from the issue    dated October 30, 1929, which &lt;br /&gt;followed two days on which the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by a total of 23%.  It read, &lt;br /&gt;“Bankers Optimistic.”  (Less than three years later, the Dow was roughly 85% lower.)  Most bankers – &lt;br /&gt;and most money managers –  seem to be congenitally optimistic about the future.  Among other things, it’s &lt;br /&gt;in their best interests, as it helps them do more business.  But their optimism certainly shapes their &lt;br /&gt;forecasts and their resulting behavior. &lt;br /&gt;Can They or Can’t&lt;br /&gt; They? &lt;br /&gt;I never thin&lt;br /&gt;k about the future –  it comes soon enough. &lt;br /&gt;– Albert E&lt;br /&gt;instein&lt;br /&gt;Consider t&lt;br /&gt;he following aspects of macro forecasting: &lt;br /&gt;•the number of&lt;br /&gt; assumptions/inputs that are required,&lt;br /&gt;•the number of processes/relationships that have to be incorporated,&lt;br /&gt;•the inherent undependability and instability of those processes, and&lt;br /&gt;•the  role of randomness and the likelihood of surprises.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom&lt;br /&gt; line for me is that forecasts can’t be right often enough to be worthwhile.  I’ve described it &lt;br /&gt;many times, but just for the sake of completeness, I’m going to restate my view of the utility (or rather, &lt;br /&gt;futility) of macro forecasts: &lt;br /&gt;•Most forec&lt;br /&gt;asts consist of extrapolation of past performance.&lt;br /&gt;•Because macro developments usually don’t diverge from prior trends, extrapolation is usually&lt;br /&gt;successful.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus   ,  most forecasts are correct.  But since extrapolation is usually anticipated by security prices,&lt;br /&gt;those who follow expectations based on extrapolation don’t enjoy unusual profits when it holds.&lt;br /&gt;•Once in a while, the behavior of the economy does deviate materially from past patterns.  Since&lt;br /&gt;this deviation comes as a surprise to most investors, its occurrence moves markets, meaning an&lt;br /&gt;accurate prediction of the deviation would be highly profitable.&lt;br /&gt;•However, since the economy doesn’t diverge from past performance very often, correct forecasts&lt;br /&gt;of deviation are rarely made and most forecasts of deviation turn out to be incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Thus, we have (a) extrapolation forecasts, most of which are correct but unprofitable, and (b)&lt;br /&gt;potentially profitable forecasts of deviation, which are rarely correct and thus are generally&lt;br /&gt;unprofitable.&lt;br /&gt;•Q.E.D.: Most forecasts don’t add to returns.&lt;br /&gt;At the lunch described at the beginning of this memo, people were asked what they expected in terms of, &lt;br /&gt;for example, Fed policy, and how that influenced their investment stance.  One person replied with &lt;br /&gt;something like, “I think the Fed will remain very worried about inflation and thus will raise rates &lt;br /&gt;significantly, bringing on a recession.  So I’m in risk-off mode.”  Another said, “I foresee inflation &lt;br /&gt;moderating in the fourth quarter, allowing the Fed to turn dovish in January.  That will allow them to &lt;br /&gt;bri ng interest rates back down and stimulate the economy.  I’m very bullish on 2023.”   &lt;br /&gt;We hear statements like these all the time.  But it must be recognized that these people are applying &lt;br /&gt;one -factor models: The speaker is basing his or her forecast on a single variable.  Talk about simplifying &lt;br /&gt;assumptions: These forecasters are implicitly holding everything constant other than Fed policy.  They’re &lt;br /&gt;playing checkers when they need to be playing 3-D chess.  Leaving aside the impossibility of predicting &lt;br /&gt;Fed behavior, the reaction of inflation to that behavior, and the reaction of markets to inflation, what &lt;br /&gt;about all the other things that matter?  If a thousand things play a part in determining the future direction &lt;br /&gt;of the economy and markets, what about the other 999?  What about the impact of wage negotiations, the &lt;br /&gt;mid  -term elections, the war in Ukraine, and the price of oil?   &lt;br /&gt;The truth&lt;br /&gt; is that humans can hold only a few things in their minds at any given time.  It’s hard to factor &lt;br /&gt;in a large number of considerations and especially to understand how a large number of things will &lt;br /&gt;interact (correlation is always the real stumper).    &lt;br /&gt;Even if you so&lt;br /&gt;mehow manage to get an economic forecast correct, that’s only half the battle.   You still &lt;br /&gt;need to anticipate how that economic activity will translate into a market outcome.  This requires an &lt;br /&gt;entirely different forecast, also involving innumerable variables, many of which pertain to psychology &lt;br /&gt;and thus are practically unknowable.  According to his student Warren Buffett, Ben Graham said, “In the &lt;br /&gt;short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”  How can &lt;br /&gt;investors’ short-run choices be predicted?  Some economic forecasters correctly concluded that the &lt;br /&gt;actions of the Fed and Treasury announced in March 2020 would rescue the U.S. economy and &lt;br /&gt;trigger an economic recovery.  But I’m not aware of anyone who predicted the torrid bull market &lt;br /&gt;that lifted off well before the recovery got underway. &lt;br /&gt;As I’ve des&lt;br /&gt;cribed before, in 2016 Buffett shared with me his view of macro forecasts.  “For a piece of &lt;br /&gt;information to be desirable, it has to satisfy two criteria: It has to be important, and it has to be &lt;br /&gt;knowable.”   &lt;br /&gt;•Of course, t&lt;br /&gt;he macro outlook is important.  These days it seems as if investors hang on every&lt;br /&gt;forecaster’s word, macro event, and twitch on the part of the Fed.  Unlike my early days in this&lt;br /&gt;business, it seems like macro is everything and corporate developments count for relatively little.&lt;br /&gt;•But I agree strongly with Buffett that the macro future isn’t knowable, or   at least almost no&lt;br /&gt;one can consistently know more about it than the mass of investors, which is what matters in&lt;br /&gt;trying to gain a knowledge advantage and make superior investment decisions.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly,  Buf&lt;br /&gt;fett’s name goes at the top of the list of investors who’ve succeeded by shunning macro &lt;br /&gt;forecasts and instead focusing on learning more than others about “the micro”: companies, industries and &lt;br /&gt;securities. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*  *        *&lt;br /&gt;In a 2001 memo called What’s It All About, Alpha?, I  introduced the concept of  the “I know” school and &lt;br /&gt;the   “I  don’t&lt;br /&gt; know” school, and in 2004, I elaborated on this at length in Us and Them.  To close the &lt;br /&gt;current m emo, I’m   goin  g to i  nsert some    of w  hat I wrote    in t  h&lt;br /&gt;e l atter    about the t wo schools: &lt;br /&gt;Most of the inv&lt;br /&gt;estors I’ve met over the years have belonged to the “I know” school.  This &lt;br /&gt;was particularly true in 1968-78, when I analyzed equities, and even in 1978-95, when I &lt;br /&gt;had switched to non-mainstream investments but still worked at equity-centric money &lt;br /&gt;management firms. &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to &lt;br /&gt;identify members of the “I know” school: &lt;br /&gt;•They think knowledge of the future direction of economies, interest rates,&lt;br /&gt;markets and widely followed mainstream stocks is essential for investment&lt;br /&gt;success.&lt;br /&gt;•They’re confident it can be achieved.&lt;br /&gt;•They know they can do it.&lt;br /&gt;•They’re aware that lots of other people are trying to do it too, but they figure&lt;br /&gt;either (a) everyone can be successful at the same time, or (b) only a few can be,&lt;br /&gt;but they’re among them.&lt;br /&gt;•They’re comfortable investing based on their opinions regarding the future.&lt;br /&gt;•They’re also glad to share their views with others, even though correct forecasts&lt;br /&gt;should be of such great value that no one would give them away gratis.&lt;br /&gt;•They rarely look back to rigorously assess their record as forecasters.&lt;br /&gt;“Confident” i&lt;br /&gt;s the key word for describing members of this school.  For the “I don’t &lt;br /&gt;know” school, on the other hand, the word –  especially when dealing with the macro-&lt;br /&gt;future –  is “guarded.”  Its adherents generally believe you can’t know the future; you &lt;br /&gt;don’t have to know the future; and the proper goal is to do the best possible job of &lt;br /&gt;investing in the absence of that knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;As a member&lt;br /&gt; of the “I know” school, you get to opine on the future (and maybe have &lt;br /&gt;people take notes).  You may be sought out for your opinions and considered a desirable &lt;br /&gt;dinner guest . . . especially when the stock market’s going up.   &lt;br /&gt;Join the “I don’t &lt;br /&gt;know” school and the results are more mixed.  You’ll soon tire of saying &lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know” to friends and strangers alike.  After a while, even relatives will stop &lt;br /&gt;asking where you think the market’s going.  You’ll never get to enjoy that 1-in-1,000 &lt;br /&gt;moment when your forecast comes true and The Wall Street Journal runs your picture.  &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, you’ll be spared all those times when forecasts miss the mark, as well &lt;br /&gt;as the losses that can result from investing based on over-rated knowledge of the future.  &lt;br /&gt;But how do you think it feels to have prospective clients ask about your investment &lt;br /&gt;outlook and have to say, “I have no idea”?   &lt;br /&gt;For me, the bottom line on which school is best comes from the late Stanford behaviorist, &lt;br /&gt;Amos Tversky: “It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but &lt;br /&gt;more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have &lt;br /&gt;faith that they know exactly what’s going on.”   &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certa&lt;br /&gt;inly standard practice in the investment management business to come up with macro forecasts, &lt;br /&gt;share them on request, and bet clients’ money on them.  It also seems conventional for money managers &lt;br /&gt;to trust in forecasts, especially their own.  Not doing so would introduce enormous dissonance, as &lt;br /&gt;described above.  But is their belief justified by the facts?  I’m eager to hear what you think. &lt;br /&gt;*  *        *&lt;br /&gt;A few years a&lt;br /&gt;go, a highly respected sell-side economist with whom I became friendly during my early &lt;br /&gt;Citibank days called me with an important message: “You’ve changed my life,” he said.  “I’ve stopped &lt;br /&gt;making forecasts.  Instead, I just tell people what’s going on today and what I see as the possible &lt;br /&gt;implications for the future.  Life is so much better.”  Can I help you reach the same state of bliss? &lt;br /&gt;September 8, 2022 &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   What Really Ma&lt;br /&gt;tters? &lt;br /&gt;I’ve    gathered a fe w ideas from    several of   my   memos this y   ear &lt;br /&gt;– plus some recent m usings and &lt;br /&gt;conversations –  to  form the s  ubject of th  is m  emo: what really matters or s  hould matter    for i  nvestors .  I’ll &lt;br /&gt;start b y e xamining a number of t  hings   that    I t hin k don’t matter. &lt;br /&gt;What Doesn’t Matter: Short-Term   Events &lt;br /&gt;In The Illusion of Knowledge (September 2022), I railed against macro forecasting, which in our &lt;br /&gt;profession mostly concerns the next year or  two.     And in I Beg to Differ (July 2022), I discussed the &lt;br /&gt;qu estions I was a   sked most frequently at  Oaktree’s June 21 conference in London:  How bad wi ll i nflation &lt;br /&gt;get  ?  How much will  the Fed rais e interest rates to fight it?  Will    those increases cause a recession?     How &lt;br /&gt;bad and for how l  o&lt;br /&gt;ng?     The bottom l   ine, I told the a ttendees, was    that t   hese things all   relate to the s   hort &lt;br /&gt;term, and    this i   s  what    I k now a   bout    the s   hort t  erm : &lt;br /&gt;•Most investors can’  t  do a&lt;br /&gt; superior job of predicting short   -term phenomena like these.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus,  they   shouldn’t put much stock in opinions on these subjects (theirs    or  those of others).&lt;br /&gt;•They’re unlikely to make major changes in their    portfolios in response to these opinions.&lt;br /&gt;•The changes they   do make are unlikely to be consistently right.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus   , t hese aren’t the things that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Consider an example.&lt;br /&gt;  I n response to the   first tremors of the Glo  bal   Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve &lt;br /&gt;began to cut the fed funds rate in 3Q2007.  They  the n  lowered it  to zero around the end of 2008 and left it &lt;br /&gt;there for   seven   years   .  In late 2015,  virtually the only question I got was “When will the first rate increase &lt;br /&gt;occur?”  My   answer was always the same: “Why do you care?   If I say ‘February,’  what will you do?  &lt;br /&gt;And if I later    change my mind and say ‘May,   ’  what will you do differently?  If everyone know  s  rates are &lt;br /&gt;about    to rise, what difference does it make which month the process starts   ?”    No one ever offered a &lt;br /&gt;convincing answer.   Investors probably think asking such   questions is part of behaving professionally, but &lt;br /&gt;I doubt they could explain why. &lt;br /&gt;The vast majority of investors can’t know for sure what    macro events lie just ahead or how the markets &lt;br /&gt;will react to the things that do happen.  In The Illusion of Knowledge,  I wrote at length about the way &lt;br /&gt;unforeseen events make a hash of economic and market forecasts.  In summary, most forecasts are &lt;br /&gt;extrapolations,  and    most of the time things don’t change,  so extrapolations  are usually correct, but   not &lt;br /&gt;particularly profitable.   On the other hand, accurate forecasts of deviations from trend can be very &lt;br /&gt;profitable, but they’re hard to make and hard to act on.  These are some of the reasons why most people &lt;br /&gt;can’t predict the future well enough to repeatably produce superior performance. &lt;br /&gt;Why is doing this so &lt;br /&gt;hard?  Don’t most of us know what events are likely to transpire?  Can’t we just buy &lt;br /&gt;the securities of the companies that are most likely to benefit from    those events?   In the long   run, maybe, &lt;br /&gt;but I want to turn to a theme that   Bruce Karsh has been emphasizing lately, regarding a major reason why &lt;br /&gt;it’s  particularly challenging to  profit    from    a  short   -term  focus  : It’s very difficult to  know which &lt;br /&gt;expectations regarding events are alrea   dy   incorporated in security prices. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the critical mistakes people are guilty of –  we see it all the time in the media –  is  believing that &lt;br /&gt;changes in security prices are the result of events: that favorable events lead to rising prices and negative &lt;br /&gt;events lead to falling prices.  I think that’s what most people believe –  especially first-l eve  l  thinkers –  but &lt;br /&gt;that’s not right.  Security prices are determined by events and how investors react to thos  e events, &lt;br /&gt;which is largely a function of how the events stack    up against investors’ expectations.    &lt;br /&gt;How    can we expla&lt;br /&gt;in the company that reports higher earnings, only to see  its stock price   drop ?  The &lt;br /&gt;answer, of course, is that the reported improvement fell short of expectations and thus disappointed &lt;br /&gt;investors.  So ,  at the most elementary level, it’s not whether the event is simply positive or not, but how &lt;br /&gt;the event compares with what was expected.    &lt;br /&gt;In my earliest workin&lt;br /&gt;g years, I used to spend a few minutes each day looking over the  earnings reports &lt;br /&gt;printed in The Wall Street Journal.   But after a while, it dawned on me that since I didn’t know what &lt;br /&gt;numbers had been expected, I had no idea whether an   announcement from a company I didn’t follow was &lt;br /&gt;good  news or bad. &lt;br /&gt;Invest   ors   can b&lt;br /&gt;ecome expert regarding  a few companies and their securities, but no one is  likely to know &lt;br /&gt;enough about macro events to (a)   be able to understand the macro expectations that underlie  the prices of &lt;br /&gt;securities, (b)   anticipate the broad events, and (c)   predict how those securities will react.   Where can   a &lt;br /&gt;prospective buyer look to find out what the   investors who set securities prices already anticipate  in terms &lt;br /&gt;of  inflation, GDP,  or un   employment?   Inferences regarding expectations can sometimes be drawn from &lt;br /&gt;asset prices, but the inferred levels often aren’t prove  d  correct when the actual results come in. &lt;br /&gt;Further, in the sh&lt;br /&gt;ort term,  security prices are highly susceptible to random and exogenous events that can &lt;br /&gt;swamp the impact of fundamental event   s.  Macro events and the ups and downs of companies’ near   -&lt;br /&gt;term fortunes are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of –  or relevant  to  –  companies’ &lt;br /&gt;long  -term prospects.  So   little    attention should be paid to them.  For example, companies often &lt;br /&gt;deliberately reduce current earnings by investing in the future of their businesses; thus   ,  low    reported &lt;br /&gt;earnings can   imply high future earnings, not continued low earnings.   To   know    the difference, you have to &lt;br /&gt;have an in-depth understanding of the company. &lt;br /&gt;No one should be foo&lt;br /&gt;led into thinking security pricing is a dependable process that accurately follows a &lt;br /&gt;set of rules.   Events are unpredictable;  they   can be altered by unpredictable influences;  and investors’ &lt;br /&gt;reactions  to  the events that occur are  unpredictable.   Due to the presence of so much uncertainty, most &lt;br /&gt;investors are  unable to improve their results by focusing on the short term. &lt;br /&gt;It’s clear from o&lt;br /&gt;bservation that security prices fluctuate much more than economic output or company &lt;br /&gt;profits.  What accounts for this?  It  must be   the fact that,  in  the short term  , the  ups and downs of &lt;br /&gt;prices are influenced far more by swings in investor psychology than by changes in companies’ &lt;br /&gt;long  -term prospects.  B ecause swings in psychology matter more in the near term than changes in &lt;br /&gt;fundamentals –  and are so hard to predict –  most short-term trading is a waste of time . . . or worse. &lt;br /&gt;What Doesn’&lt;br /&gt;t Matter: The Trading Mentality &lt;br /&gt;Over the years,  my me&lt;br /&gt;mos    have often included some of my father’s jokes from the 1950s,  based on my &lt;br /&gt;strong belief that humor often    ref lects truths  about the human condition.  Given its relevance here, I’m &lt;br /&gt;going to devote a bit of space to a  joke    I’ve    shared before: &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two friends meet in the street, and Joe asks Sam what’s new.  “Oh,” he replies, “I just &lt;br /&gt;got a case of great sardines.”   &lt;br /&gt;Joe:     Great, I l&lt;br /&gt;ove sardines.  I’ll take some.  How much are they? &lt;br /&gt;Sam:      $10,000 a ti&lt;br /&gt;n.  &lt;br /&gt;Joe:     What!  &lt;br /&gt;How can a tin of sardines cost $10,000? &lt;br /&gt;Sam:      These are the&lt;br /&gt; greatest sardines in the world.  Each one is a pedigreed purebred, &lt;br /&gt;with papers.  They were caught by net, not hook; deboned by hand; and packed &lt;br /&gt;in the finest extra-virgin olive oil.  And the label was painted by a well-known &lt;br /&gt;artist.  They’re a bargain at $10,000. &lt;br /&gt;Joe:       But who would ever eat $10,000 sardines? &lt;br /&gt;Sam:      Oh, these aren’&lt;br /&gt;t eating sardines; they’re trading sardines. &lt;br /&gt;I include this ol&lt;br /&gt;d joke because I believe most people treat stocks and bonds like something to trade, not &lt;br /&gt;something to own. &lt;br /&gt;If you ask Warren Buffett to describe the foundation of his approach to investing, he’ll probably &lt;br /&gt;start by insisting that stocks should be thought of as ownership interests in companies.   Most people &lt;br /&gt;don’t start companies with the goal of selling them in the short term, but rather they seek to operate them, &lt;br /&gt;enjoy   profitability, and expand the business.  Of course, founders do these things to ultimately make &lt;br /&gt;money, but they’re likely to view the money as the byproduct of having run a successful business.  &lt;br /&gt;Buffett says people who buy stocks should think of themselves as partners of owners  with    who  m they &lt;br /&gt;share   goals.   &lt;br /&gt;But I think t&lt;br /&gt;hat’s rarely the  case  .  Most people buy stocks with the goal of selling them at a   higher &lt;br /&gt;price   , thinking they’re for trading, not for owning.   This means they abandon the owner mentality and &lt;br /&gt;instead act like    gamblers  or speculators  who   bet on stock    price moves.  The results are often    unpleasant. &lt;br /&gt;The DALBAR Institute 2012 study showed that investors receive three percentage points &lt;br /&gt;less per year than the S&amp;P 500 generated from 1992 to 2012, and the average holding &lt;br /&gt;period for a typical investor is six months.   Six Months!!  When you hold a stock for less &lt;br /&gt;than a year, you are not using the stock market to acquire business ownership positions &lt;br /&gt;and participate in the growth of that business.  Instead, you are just guessing at short-term &lt;br /&gt;news and expectations, and your returns are based on how other people react to that news &lt;br /&gt;information.   In aggregate, that kind of attitude gets you three percentage points less per &lt;br /&gt;year than you’d get from doing nothing at all beyond making the initial investment in the &lt;br /&gt;index    fund of the S&amp;P 500.  (“Fidelity’s Best Investors Are Dead,” The C onservative &lt;br /&gt;Income I nvestor, April 8, 202 0) &lt;br /&gt;To me, buying &lt;br /&gt;for a short-term trade equates to forgetting about your sports team’s chances of winning &lt;br /&gt;the championship and instead betting on who’s going to succeed in the next play, period,  or inning.  &lt;br /&gt;Let’s think&lt;br /&gt; about the logic.  You buy a stock because you think it’s worth more than you have to pay for &lt;br /&gt;it,  whereas the seller considers it fully priced.  Someday,  if things go well, it’ll become fully priced,  in &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your opinion, meaning you’ll sell it.  The person you sell it to, however, will buy it because he   thinks it’s &lt;br /&gt;worth still more.  We used to talk about this process as being reliant on the Greater    F ool   Theory: No &lt;br /&gt;matter what    price     I pay for a stock, there   will always be someone who will  buy    it from me for more, &lt;br /&gt;despite the fact that I’m selling because I’ve concluded that    it has reached full value. &lt;br /&gt;Every buyer is&lt;br /&gt; motivated by the  belief that the stock will eventually be worth more than today’s price (a &lt;br /&gt;view the seller presumably doesn’t share).  The key question is  what    type of thinking underlies these &lt;br /&gt;purchases.  Are the buyers buying because this is a company they’d like to own a piece of for years?  &lt;br /&gt;Or are they merely betting that   the price will go up?   The transactions may look the same from the &lt;br /&gt;outside, but I wonder about the thought process and thus the    soundness of the logic. &lt;br /&gt;Each time a&lt;br /&gt; stock is traded, one side is wrong and one is  right.  But if what you’re doing is betting &lt;br /&gt;on trends in popularity, and thus the direction of price move   s over the next month, quarter,  or &lt;br /&gt;year  , is it realistic to believe you’ll be right more often than the person on the other side of the &lt;br /&gt;trad  e?   Maybe the decline of active management can be attributed to the many active managers who &lt;br /&gt;placed bets on the direction of stock prices in the short term, instead of picking companies they wanted to &lt;br /&gt;own part of for years.  It’s all a matter of the underlying mentality.   &lt;br /&gt;I had a long&lt;br /&gt; debate on this topic with my father back in 1969, when I lived    with    him    during my first &lt;br /&gt;months at First National City Bank.  (It’s amazing for me to think back to those days;  he   was    so much &lt;br /&gt;younger than I am today.)  I told him I thought buying a stock should be motivated by something other &lt;br /&gt;than   the   hop e that    the price would rise , and   I suggested this might be the expectation that dividends would &lt;br /&gt;increase over time.  He countered that no one buys stocks for the dividends –  they buy because they think &lt;br /&gt;the   price will   go up.  But what would trigger the rise?   &lt;br /&gt;Wanting to own a&lt;br /&gt; business for its commercial merit and long-term earnings potential is a good reason to &lt;br /&gt;be a stockholder, and if these expectations are borne out, a good     reason to believe the   stock price will rise. &lt;br /&gt;In the absence of that, buying in the hope of appreciation merely amounts to trying to guess which &lt;br /&gt;industries and companies investors  will favor in the future.  Ben Graham  famously said, “In the short run, &lt;br /&gt;the market is a voting machine,  but   in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”  While none of this is &lt;br /&gt;easy, as Charlie Munger once told me, carefully weighing long  -term merit should produce better &lt;br /&gt;results than    trying to  guess at short   -term swings in popularity. &lt;br /&gt;What Doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;Matter: Short-T erm Performanc&lt;br /&gt;e &lt;br /&gt;Given the poss&lt;br /&gt;ible contributors to short   -term investment performance, reported results can present a &lt;br /&gt;highly misleading picture, and here I’m talking mostly about superior gains in good times.  I feel there are &lt;br /&gt;three ingredients for   success during good times –  aggressiveness, timing, and skill –  and    if you have &lt;br /&gt;enough aggressiveness at the right time, you don’t need that much skill.  We all know that in good times, &lt;br /&gt;the highest returns often go to the person whose portfolio incorporates the most risk, beta, and correlation.  &lt;br /&gt;Having such a portfolio isn’t a mark of distinction or insight if the investor is a perma-bull    who’s always &lt;br /&gt;positioned aggressively.  Finally, random events can have an overwhelming impact on returns –  in either &lt;br /&gt;direction –  in a given quarter or year. &lt;br /&gt;One of the   recu&lt;br /&gt;rring themes in my memos is  the idea that the quality of a decision cannot be determined &lt;br /&gt;from the outcome alone   .   Decisions often lead to negative outcomes even    when they’re well   -reasoned and &lt;br /&gt;based on all the available information.  On the other hand, we all know people –  even   occasionally &lt;br /&gt;ourselves –  who  ’ve been right for the wrong reason.   Hidden information and random developments can &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;frustrate even the best thinkers’  decisions.  ( However, when outcomes are considered over a long  period &lt;br /&gt;of time and a large number of trials, the  better decision maker i s overwhelmingly likely to have a higher &lt;br /&gt;proportion of successes.)  &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, no &lt;br /&gt;one should attach much significance to returns  in one quarter or year.  Investment &lt;br /&gt;performance is simply one result drawn from the   full range of returns that could have materialized, &lt;br /&gt;and in the   short term  ,  it can be heavily influenced by random events.  Th  us,   a single quarter’s &lt;br /&gt;return is likely to be a very    weak indicator of an investor’s ability, if that.  Deciding whether   a &lt;br /&gt;manager has special skill –  or whether an asset allocation is appropriate for the long run –  on  the basis of &lt;br /&gt;one quarter  or year is like forming an opinion of a baseball player on the basis of one trip to the plate, or &lt;br /&gt;of a racehorse based on one race.  &lt;br /&gt;We know short   -term&lt;br /&gt; performance doesn’t matter much.  And yet, most of the investment committees I’ve &lt;br /&gt;sat on have had the latest quarter’s performance as the first item    on the agenda and devoted a meaningful &lt;br /&gt;portion of each meeting to it.  The discussion is usually extensive, but it rarely leads to significant action.  &lt;br /&gt;So why do we keep doing it?  For   the   same reasons investors pay attention to forecasting, as described in &lt;br /&gt;The Illusion of Knowledge: “e  veryone does it,” and “it would be irresponsible not to.” &lt;br /&gt;What Doesn&lt;br /&gt;’t Matter: Volatility &lt;br /&gt;I haven’t wr&lt;br /&gt;itten much about volatility, other than to say I strongly disagree with people who consider it &lt;br /&gt;the definition or essence of risk.  I’v e described my belief that the academics who developed the Chicago &lt;br /&gt;School theory of investment in the early 1960s (a) wanted to examine the relationship between investment &lt;br /&gt;returns and   risk, (b) needed a number quantifying risk that they could put into their calculations, and (c) &lt;br /&gt;undoubtedly chose volatility as a proxy for risk for the simple reason that it was the only quantifiable &lt;br /&gt;metric available.  I define risk   as the probability of a bad outcome, and volatility is, at best, an indicator of &lt;br /&gt;the presence of risk.  But volatility is not risk.  That’s all I’m going to say on that subject. &lt;br /&gt;What I want to&lt;br /&gt; talk about here is the extent to which thinking and caring about volatility has &lt;br /&gt;warped the investing world over the 50-plus years that I’ve been in it.   It  was a great advantage for &lt;br /&gt;me to have attended the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago in the late ’60s and to &lt;br /&gt;have been part of one of the very first classes that was taught the new theories.  I learned about the &lt;br /&gt;efficient market hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, the random walk, the importance of risk &lt;br /&gt;aversion, and the role of volatility as risk.  While volatility wasn’t a topic of conversation when I got in to &lt;br /&gt;the real world of investing in 1969, practice soon   caught up with theory. &lt;br /&gt;In particu&lt;br /&gt;lar, the Sharpe ratio was adopted as the measure of risk-adjusted return.  It’s the ratio of a &lt;br /&gt;portfolio’s excess return (the part of its  return that exceeds the yield on T- bills  ) to its volatility.  T he   more &lt;br /&gt;return per unit of volatility, the   higher the risk-adjusted return.  Risk adjustment is an essential concept, &lt;br /&gt;and returns should absolutely be   evaluated relative to the risk that was taken to achieve them.  Everyone &lt;br /&gt;cites Sharpe ratios, including Oaktree, because it’s the only quantitative tool   available for the job.   (If &lt;br /&gt;investors, consultants,  and clients didn’t use the Sharpe ratio, they  ’d have no metric at all, and if they tried &lt;br /&gt;to  substitute fundamental riskiness for volatility in their assessments, they’d find that there’s no   way to &lt;br /&gt;quantify it.)  The Sharpe ratio may hint at risk  -adjusted performance in the same way that volatility &lt;br /&gt;hints at risk, but    since volatility isn’t risk, the Sharpe ratio is a  very   imp erfect measure. &lt;br /&gt;Take, for exam&lt;br /&gt;ple, one of the asset classes I started working with in 1978:  high yield bonds.  At Oaktree, &lt;br /&gt;we think moderately   -above-benchmark returns can be produced with substantially less risk than the &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;benchmark,  and   this    shows up in  superior Sharpe ratios.  But the real risk in high yield bonds –  the one &lt;br /&gt;we care about and have a history of reducing – is the risk of default.  We don’t much care about reducing &lt;br /&gt;volatility, and we don’t take conscious steps to do so  .   We believe high   Shar   pe ratios can result from    – &lt;br /&gt;and    perhaps are correlated with –  the actions we take to reduce defaults. &lt;br /&gt;Volatility&lt;br /&gt; is particularly irrelevant in our field of fixed income or “credit.”   Bonds, notes   ,  and    loans &lt;br /&gt;represent contractual promises of  periodic inter   est and repayment at maturity.  Most of the time when &lt;br /&gt;you buy  a bond with an 8% yield   ,  you  ’ll  basically get the 8%    yield    over its life, regardless of &lt;br /&gt;whether the bond price goes up or down in  the interim.   I  say “basically” because, if the price falls, &lt;br /&gt;you’ll have the opportunity to  reinvest the interest payments at  yields above 8%, so your holding-period &lt;br /&gt;return will creep up.   Thus,     the downward price volatility that so many revile is actually a good thing –  as &lt;br /&gt;long as it doesn’t presage defaults.  (Note that, as indicated in this paragraph, “volatility” is often a &lt;br /&gt;misnomer.  Strategists and the media often warn that “there may be volatility ahead.”  What they really &lt;br /&gt;mean is “there may be price declines ahead.”  No one worries about,  or minds experiencing, volatility to &lt;br /&gt;the upside.) &lt;br /&gt;It’s essential t&lt;br /&gt;o recognize that protection from volatility generally isn’t a free good.  Reducing &lt;br /&gt;vola  tility for its own sake is a suboptimizing strategy: It  should be presumed that    favoring low er-&lt;br /&gt;volatility assets and approaches will –  all things being equal –  lead to lower  returns.  Only managers &lt;br /&gt;with   superior skill   ,  or alpha (see    page 11),  will be able to overcome this negative presumption and    reduc   e &lt;br /&gt;return less than they reduce volatility.   &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless&lt;br /&gt;, since many clients, bosses, and other constituents are uncomfortable with radical ups and &lt;br /&gt;downs (well, mostly with downs), asset managers often take    steps to reduce volatility.  Consider what &lt;br /&gt;happened after institutional investors began to pile into  hedge funds following  the three-year decline of &lt;br /&gt;stocks brought on by the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000.  (This   was    the first three-year decline since &lt;br /&gt;1939-41.)  Hedge funds –  previously members of a cottage industry where most funds had   a few hundred &lt;br /&gt;million dollars of capital from wealthy individuals –  did much better than stocks in the downdraft.  &lt;br /&gt;Institutions were attracted to these funds’ low volatility, and thus invested billions in them.   &lt;br /&gt;The average&lt;br /&gt; hedge fund delivered the stability the institutions wanted.  But somewhere in the shuffle, the &lt;br /&gt;idea of earning high returns with low volatility got lost.  Instead, hedge fund managers pursued low &lt;br /&gt;volatility as a goal in itself, since the y  knew it  was what the institutions were after.  As a result, over &lt;br /&gt;roughly the last 18 years, the average hedge fund delivered the low volatility that was desired, but   it was &lt;br /&gt;accompanied by modest single-digit    returns.  No miracle there. &lt;br /&gt;Why do I reci&lt;br /&gt;te all this?  Because volatility is  just   a temporary phenomenon (assuming you survive &lt;br /&gt;it  financially),  and  most     investors shouldn’t attach as much importance to it as they seem to.   As   I &lt;br /&gt;wrote in I Beg to Differ, many investors have the luxury of being able to focus exclusively on the long &lt;br /&gt;term    . . . if they will take advantage of it.   Volatility should be less of a concern for   investors: &lt;br /&gt;•whose    entities are lon&lt;br /&gt;g-lived, like life insurance companies, endowments,  and pension funds;&lt;br /&gt;•whose capital isn’t  subject to lump -sum    withdrawal;&lt;br /&gt;•whose essential activities won’t be jeopardized by downward fluctuations;&lt;br /&gt;•who don’t have to worry about being forced into mistakes by  their    constituents ;  and&lt;br /&gt;•who   haven’t levered up with debt that might have to  be   repa  id in the short run.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors lack some of these things, and    few  have them all.  But to the extent these characteristics &lt;br /&gt;are  present, investors should take advantage of their    ability to withstand volatility, since many &lt;br /&gt;investments with   the potential for high returns might be susceptible to substantial fluctuations.    &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;br /&gt; always puts it best, and on this topic he usefully said, “We prefer a lumpy 15% &lt;br /&gt;return to a smooth 12% return.”  Investors who’d rather have the reverse –  who    find  a smooth &lt;br /&gt;12%     preferable to a lumpy 15% –  should ask themselves whether their aversion to volatility is &lt;br /&gt;mostly financial or mostly emotional. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, t&lt;br /&gt;he   choices made by employees, investment committee members, and hired investment &lt;br /&gt;managers may have to reflect real  -world considerations.  People in charge of instit   ution   al portfolios can   &lt;br /&gt;have    valid   reasons for avoiding ups and downs that their organizations or clients might be able to stomach &lt;br /&gt;in  financial terms    bu t w ould   still    find unpleasant.  All anyone can do is the best they can under their &lt;br /&gt;particular circumstances.  But my bottom line is this: In many cases, people accord volatility far more &lt;br /&gt;importance than    they    should. &lt;br /&gt;An Aside &lt;br /&gt;While I’m o&lt;br /&gt;n the subject of volatility, I want to turn to an area that hasn’t reported much of it of late: &lt;br /&gt;private investment funds.  The first nine months of 2022 constituted one of the worst periods on record &lt;br /&gt;for both stocks and bonds.  Yet many private equity and private debt funds are reporting only    small losses   &lt;br /&gt;for the year to date.  I ’m often asked what this means, and whether it reflects reality. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe the&lt;br /&gt; performance of private funds is  being reported accurately.  ( I know we believe ours is.)   But I &lt;br /&gt;recently came across an interesting Financial Times article provocatively titled, “ The volatility &lt;br /&gt;laundering, return manipulation and ‘phoney happiness’ of private equity,” by Robin Wigglesworth.  &lt;br /&gt;Here’s some of its content:  &lt;br /&gt;The widening per&lt;br /&gt;formance gap between public and private markets is a huge topic these &lt;br /&gt;days.  Investors are often seen as the gormless [foolish] dupes falling for the “return &lt;br /&gt;manipulation” of cunning private equity tycoons.  But what if they are co-conspirators? . . .  &lt;br /&gt;That’s what&lt;br /&gt; a new paper from three academics at the University of Florida argues.  Based &lt;br /&gt;on nearly two decades worth of private equity real estate funds data,  Blake Jackson, &lt;br /&gt;David Ling and Andy Naranjo conclude that “private equity fund managers manipulate &lt;br /&gt;returns to cater to their investors.”  &lt;br /&gt;. . .   Jackson, L&lt;br /&gt;ing and Naranjo’s . . .  central conclusion is that “GPs do not appear &lt;br /&gt;to manipulate interim returns to fool their LPs, but rather because their LPs want &lt;br /&gt;them to do so”.  &lt;br /&gt;Similar to t&lt;br /&gt;he idea that banks design financial products to cater to yield-seeking &lt;br /&gt;investors or firms issue dividends to cater to investor demand for dividend &lt;br /&gt;payments, we argue that PE fund managers boost interim performance reports &lt;br /&gt;to cater to some investors’ demand for manipulated returns.  &lt;br /&gt;. . . If a GP bo&lt;br /&gt;osts or smooths returns, . . .  investment managers within LP &lt;br /&gt;organizations can report artificially higher Sharpe ratios, alphas, and top-&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line returns, such as IRRs, to their trustees or other overseers.   In doing so, &lt;br /&gt;these investment managers, whose median tenure of four years often expires &lt;br /&gt;years before the ultimate returns of a PE fund are realized, might improve their &lt;br /&gt;internal job security or potential labor market outcomes. . . .      &lt;br /&gt;This probably helps &lt;br /&gt;explain why private equity firms on average actually reported gains &lt;br /&gt;of 1.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 and only some modest mark downwards since &lt;br /&gt;then, despite global equities losing 22 per cent of their value this year.   (November 2, &lt;br /&gt;2022 .  E mphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;If bo  th GPs and LPs a  re h  appy with returns that s   eem un&lt;br /&gt;usually good, might the result be s  uspect?  Is  the &lt;br /&gt;performance of p  rivate assets being stated accurately?  Is t  he l  ow   volatility being reported&lt;br /&gt; genuine?  If the &lt;br /&gt;current business climate is challenging, shouldn’t that affect&lt;br /&gt; the   prices of public and private investments &lt;br /&gt;alike   ?   &lt;br /&gt;But t  here ’s a nothe   r series of relevant questions: Mightn’t it b e  fair   for G   Ps   to decline to m ark down &lt;br /&gt;priv  ate i  nvestments in c ompanies that    have experienced short-term weakness but whose lon g-term &lt;br /&gt;prospects remain bright?   And    while private investments might not h ave   bee n mark   ed down enough this &lt;br /&gt;year  , isn’t    it true    that  the prices of  publ&lt;br /&gt;ic  securities are more volatile than they s hould be  , ov erstating the &lt;br /&gt;changes in long   -term value  ?  I c ertainly thin  k public security prices reflect psychological swings that are &lt;br /&gt;often excessive.  Should the prices of private investments emulate this  ? &lt;br /&gt;As   with m ost   things, any i   naccuracy in reporting will e  vent ually    come to li  ght.     Eventually, private debt &lt;br /&gt;will mature, and p   r&lt;br /&gt;ivate equit   y holdings will have t o be   sold  .  If   the   returns bei  ng reported this y   ear &lt;br /&gt;understate the   real    declines in value, performance from here  on ou  t  wil l likely loo k surprisingly poor   .  &lt;br /&gt;And    I’m s  ure   thi s wil l lead    plenty of academics (and maybe a few regulators) to question whether the &lt;br /&gt;pricing of private investm&lt;br /&gt;ents    in 20  22 was too  high  .   We’ll see. &lt;br /&gt;What Doesn’t Matter: Hyper-Activity &lt;br /&gt;In Selling Out (January 2022), I expressed my    strong view that most investors trade too much.  Since it’s &lt;br /&gt;hard t&lt;br /&gt;o make multiple consecutive decisions correctly,  a&lt;br /&gt;nd t  radin  g costs money and is  often likely to &lt;br /&gt;result from    an   investor’s emotional swings,  it’s b   etter t  o  do l  ess o   f  it.   &lt;br /&gt;When I was   a b oy ,  there was  a popular saying : D on’t ju&lt;br /&gt;st si t there; do s omething.  But for &lt;br /&gt;investing, I’d&lt;br /&gt; inver   t it: Don’t just d  o s omething; sit th ere.     Develop the mindset  that you don’t make &lt;br /&gt;money on w  hat   you buy and s   ell; you make money (hopefully) on what  you    hold.  Think more.  Trade &lt;br /&gt;less.  Mak  e fewer, bu t more consequential, trades.  Over   -diversification reduces the i  mportance of  each &lt;br /&gt;trade; thus    it can   allow investors to take    actions without adequate investigation or  great    conviction.  I t hink &lt;br /&gt;most    portfolios are overdiversified and   over-traded.   &lt;br /&gt;I d evoted a    good portion of The Illusion of Knowledge and Selling Out to warning investors about    how &lt;br /&gt;difficult it i s  to  improve returns through short   -term market    timing, a nd   I q uoted the g   reat    investor  Bill &lt;br /&gt;Miller: “T ime, not timing, is k ey   to b  uilding wealth in th  e s tock m arket.”   &lt;br /&gt;On   this  subject, I  was    recently asked by a consultant, “If   you don’t try to get in and out  of t  he m  arket    as &lt;br /&gt;appropriate, how  do   you earn your fees?”  My answer    was  that i   t’s our job  to assemble portfolios that    will &lt;br /&gt;perform well   over t he l  ong r un,   a nd   market timing is unlikely to add to the outcome unle  ss it c an be done &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, which I’m not convinced is usually the case.  “What about you?” I asked.  “If you help a client &lt;br /&gt;establish an appropriate asset allocation, does it follow that you’re not earning your fees if you don’t &lt;br /&gt;change it a month later?” &lt;br /&gt;Likewise, &lt;br /&gt;the day The Illusion of Knowledge came out, an old friend asked me, “But you have to take a &lt;br /&gt;position [on short-run  events], don’t you?”   My answer, predictably, was, “No, not if  you don  ’t have an &lt;br /&gt;advantage when doing so.   Why would you bet on the outcome of a coin toss  , especially if it cost money &lt;br /&gt;to play?” &lt;br /&gt;I’ll end my dis&lt;br /&gt;cussion of this subject with   a wonderful citation: &lt;br /&gt;A news item th&lt;br /&gt;at has gotten a lot of attention recently concerned an internal performance &lt;br /&gt;review of Fidelity accounts to determine which type of investors received the best returns &lt;br /&gt;between 2003 and 2013. The customer account audit revealed that the best investors were &lt;br /&gt;either dead or inactive – the people who switched jobs and “forgot” about an old 401(k) &lt;br /&gt;leaving the current options in place, or the people who died and the assets were frozen &lt;br /&gt;while the estate handled the assets.  ( “Fidelity’s Best Investors Are Dead,” The &lt;br /&gt;Conservative I ncome I nvestor, April 8, 202 0) &lt;br /&gt;Since the   journa&lt;br /&gt;lists   have been unable to find the Fidelity study, and apparently so   has Fidelity, the story &lt;br /&gt;is  probably apocryphal.  But I still like the idea, since    the conclusion is so much in line with my thinking.  &lt;br /&gt;I’m not saying it’s worth dying to improve investment performance, but it might be   a good idea for &lt;br /&gt;investors to   simulate that condition by sitting on their     hands. &lt;br /&gt;So What Doe&lt;br /&gt;s Matter? &lt;br /&gt;What really ma&lt;br /&gt;tters is the   performance of your holdings over the next five or ten years    ( or more) &lt;br /&gt;and  how the value at the end of the  period compares to the amount you invested and  to your needs.  &lt;br /&gt;Some people say the long run is a series of short runs, and if you get those right, you’ll enjoy success in &lt;br /&gt;the long run.  They might think the route to success consists  of trading often    in order to capitalize  on &lt;br /&gt;relative value assessments, predictions regarding swings in popularity, and forecasts of macro events.  I &lt;br /&gt;obviously do not. &lt;br /&gt;Most individu&lt;br /&gt;al  investors and anyone who understands the limitations regarding outperformance would &lt;br /&gt;probably be best off holding index funds over    the long run.  Investment professionals and others who feel &lt;br /&gt;they   need or want to engage in active management might benefit from the following suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;I think most people would be more successful if they focused less on the short run or macro trends and &lt;br /&gt;instead work  ed  hard to gain superior insight concerning the outlook for fundamentals over multi-year &lt;br /&gt;periods in the future.  They should: &lt;br /&gt;•study    companies a&lt;br /&gt;nd securities, assessing things such as their earnings potential;&lt;br /&gt;•buy the ones that can be purchased at attractive prices relative to their potential;&lt;br /&gt;•hold   onto   them     as l  ong as the company’s earnings outlook and    the attractiveness of the price&lt;br /&gt;remain intact   ;  and&lt;br /&gt;•make changes only when those things can’t be reconfirmed,  or  when something better comes&lt;br /&gt;along.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At   the London conference mentioned on page one – w  hile    I was discussing (and discouraging) &lt;br /&gt;paying attenti   on to the short run –  I said that   at Oaktree we   consider it our job to (a)   buy debt that &lt;br /&gt;will be serviced as promised (or will   return the same amount or   more if not) and  (b)   in vest in &lt;br /&gt;companies that will become more valuable over time.   I’ll   stick   with    that.   &lt;br /&gt;The above des&lt;br /&gt;cription of the investor’s job is  quite    simple . . . some might say simplistic.  And it is.  &lt;br /&gt;Setting out the goals and the   process in broad terms is easy.  The hard part is  executing better than most &lt;br /&gt;people: T hat’s    the only route to market-beating performance.  Since average decision-making is &lt;br /&gt;reflected in  security prices and produces average performance, superior results have to be based on &lt;br /&gt;superior insight.  But    I  can’t tell you how to do these things better than the  average investor. &lt;br /&gt;There’s a lot more to  the process, and I’m going to outline some of what I think are  key    elements to &lt;br /&gt;remember.  You’ll recognize recurring themes here, from other memos and from earlier pages in this one, &lt;br /&gt;but I make no apology for dwel   ling on things that are important: &lt;br /&gt;•Forget the s&lt;br /&gt;hort run –  only the long run matters.  Think of securities as interests in companies, not&lt;br /&gt;trading cards.&lt;br /&gt;•Decide whether you believe in market efficiency.   If so, is your market sufficiently inefficient  to&lt;br /&gt;permit outperformance, and are you up to the task of exploiting it?&lt;br /&gt;•Decide whether your approach will    lean more toward aggressiveness or defensiveness.  Will you&lt;br /&gt;try to find more and bigger winners or focus on avoid   ing  losers, or both?   Will    you try to make&lt;br /&gt;more on the way up or lose less on the down, or both  ?  (Hint: “both” is much harder to achieve&lt;br /&gt;than one or the other.)   In general, people’s investment style   s  should fit  their personalities .&lt;br /&gt;•Think about what your normal risk posture should be  –  your normal balance between&lt;br /&gt;aggressiveness and defensiveness –  based on your or your clients’ financial position, needs,&lt;br /&gt;aspirations, and ability to live with fluctuations.  Consider whether you’ll vary your balance&lt;br /&gt;depending on what happens in the market.&lt;br /&gt;•Adopt a healthy attitude toward return and risk.  Understand that “the more return potential, the&lt;br /&gt;better” can be a dangerous rule to follow given that increased return potential is usually&lt;br /&gt;accompanied by increased risk.   On the other hand, completely avoiding risk usually leads to&lt;br /&gt;avoid   ing return as well.&lt;br /&gt;•Insist on an adequate margin of safety, or the ability to weather periods when things go less well&lt;br /&gt;than   you expected.&lt;br /&gt;•Stop trying to predict the macro; study the micro like mad in order to know your subject better&lt;br /&gt;than others.  Understand that you can expect to succeed only if you have a knowledge advantage,&lt;br /&gt;and be realistic about whether you have it or not.  Recognize that trying harder isn’t    enough.&lt;br /&gt;Accept my son Andrew’s view that merely possessing “readily available quantitative information&lt;br /&gt;regarding the present” won’t give you above average results, since everyone else   has it   .&lt;br /&gt;•Recognize that psychology swings much more than fundamentals, and usually in the wrong&lt;br /&gt;direction or at the wrong time  .   Understand the importance of resisting those swings.   Profit if you&lt;br /&gt;can by being counter-cyclical and contrarian.&lt;br /&gt;•Study conditions in the   investment environment –  especially investor behavior –  and consider&lt;br /&gt;where things stand in terms of the cycle.  Understand that    where the market stands in its  cycle&lt;br /&gt;will    strongly influence whether the odds are in your favor or against you.&lt;br /&gt;•Buy debt when you like   the yield, not for trading purposes.  In other words, buy 9% bonds if you&lt;br /&gt;think the yield compensates you   for the risk,  and    you’   ll be happy with 9%.  Don’t buy 9% bonds&lt;br /&gt;expecting to make 11% thanks to price appreciation resulting from declining interest rates.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of critical importance, equity investors should make their primary goals  (a)   participating in the &lt;br /&gt;secular growth of economies and companies and    (b)   benefiting from the wonder of compounding.  &lt;br /&gt;Think about the 10.5%  yearly return of  the S&amp;P 500 Index (or its predecessors)  since 1926 and the fact &lt;br /&gt;that   this   would have turned $1 into over    $13,000 by now, even though the period witnessed 16   recessions, &lt;br /&gt;one Great Depression, several wars, one World War, a global pandemic, and    many instances of &lt;br /&gt;geopolitical turmoil.     &lt;br /&gt;Think of part&lt;br /&gt;icipating in the long-term performance of the average as the main event and the   active &lt;br /&gt;efforts to improve on it as “embroidery around the edges.”   This    might be the reverse of most active &lt;br /&gt;investors’ attitudes.  Improving results through over-  and underweighting, short-term trading, market &lt;br /&gt;timing, and other active measures isn’t easy.  Believing you can do these things successfully requires &lt;br /&gt;the   assumption that you’re smarter than a bunch of very smart people.  Think twice before &lt;br /&gt;proceeding, as the requirements for success are high (see below). &lt;br /&gt;Don’ t  mess it up by over   -trad  ing .   Thi  nk of  buying and selling as a n expense item  , not a profit center.   I &lt;br /&gt;love the idea of the automated factory of the future, with its   one man and one dog; The   dog’s job is to &lt;br /&gt;keep the man from touching the machinery, and the man’s job is to feed the dog.  Investors should find a &lt;br /&gt;way to keep their hands off their    portfolios most of the time. &lt;br /&gt;A Special Wor&lt;br /&gt;d in Closing: Asy   m&lt;br /&gt;metry &lt;br /&gt;“Asymmetry&lt;br /&gt;” is a concept I’ve been conscious of for decades and consider more important with &lt;br /&gt;every passing year.  It’s my word for the essence of investment excellence and a  standard against &lt;br /&gt;which investors should be measured.    &lt;br /&gt;First, som&lt;br /&gt;e definitions: &lt;br /&gt;•I’m going to&lt;br /&gt; talk below about whether an investor has “alpha.”  Alpha is technically defined as&lt;br /&gt;return in excess of the benchmark return, but I prefer to think of it  as superior investing skill.  It’s&lt;br /&gt;the ability to find   and exploit inefficiencies when they’re present.&lt;br /&gt;•Inefficiencies –  mispricings or mistakes –  represent instances when an asset’s price diverges from&lt;br /&gt;its fair value.  These divergences can show up as bargains or the opposite, over-pricings.&lt;br /&gt;•Bargains will dependably perform better than other investments over time after adjustment for&lt;br /&gt;their riskiness.  Over-pricings will do the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;•“B eta ”  is an investor’s or a portfolio’s relative volatility, also described as relative sensitivity or&lt;br /&gt;systematic risk.&lt;br /&gt;People who be&lt;br /&gt;lieve in the efficient market hypothesis think of a portfolio’s return as  the product of the &lt;br /&gt;market’s return multiplied by the   portfolio’s beta.  This is all it takes to explain results, since there are no &lt;br /&gt;mispricings to take advantage of in an efficient market (and    so  no such thing as alpha).  Thus, alpha is &lt;br /&gt;skill    that   enables an i  nvestor to  produce performance better than that which is explained purely by &lt;br /&gt;market return and beta.   Another way to say this is that having alpha allows an investor to enjoy profit &lt;br /&gt;potential that is disproportionate to loss potential:  asymmetry.  In  my view, asymmetry is present when an &lt;br /&gt;investor can repeatedly do some or all of the following: &lt;br /&gt;•make more mone&lt;br /&gt;y in good markets than he gives back in bad markets,&lt;br /&gt;•have more winners than losers,&lt;br /&gt;•make more money on his  winners than he loses on his losers,&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•do well when his  aggressive or defensive bias proves timely but   not badly when it does   n’t,&lt;br /&gt;•do well when his  sector or strategy is in favor but  not badly when it  isn’t   , and&lt;br /&gt;•construct portfolios so that most of the surprises are on   the upside.&lt;br /&gt;For   example&lt;br /&gt;, m ost of us have an inherent bias   toward either aggressiveness or defensiveness.  For this &lt;br /&gt;reason, it doesn’t mean much if an a ggressive investor outperforms in a good year or a defensive investor &lt;br /&gt;outperforms in a bad year.  To determine whether they have alpha and produce asymmetry, we have to &lt;br /&gt;consider whether the aggressive investor is able to avoid the full loss that his aggressiveness alone would &lt;br /&gt;produce in a bad market and    whether the defensive investor can avoid missing out on too much of the &lt;br /&gt;gain    when the market does well.  In my opinion, “excellence” lies in asymmetry between the results in &lt;br /&gt;good and bad times. &lt;br /&gt;As I see it, if inefficiencies are present in  an investor’s market,  and  she has alpha, the impact will &lt;br /&gt;show up in asymmetrical returns.  If her returns show no asymmetry, the investor doesn’t have &lt;br /&gt;alpha (or   perhaps there are no inefficiencies for her  to identify).   Flipping that over, if  an investor &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t have alpha, her   returns won’t be asymmetrical.  It’s as simple as that. &lt;br /&gt;To s  implify, h&lt;br /&gt;ere’s how I think about asymmetry.  This discussion is based on material I included in my &lt;br /&gt;2018 book Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side.   While I may    appear to be talking &lt;br /&gt;about one good year and one bad one  , these observations can only be considered valid    if  these patterns &lt;br /&gt;hold   over    a meaningful number of years. &lt;br /&gt;Let’s consi&lt;br /&gt;der   a  manager’s performance: &lt;br /&gt;Market performance +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;Manager A +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;The  above manage&lt;br /&gt;r clearly adds no value.  You might as well invest in an index fund (probably at a much    &lt;br /&gt;lower fee). &lt;br /&gt;These two mana&lt;br /&gt;gers    also add no value: &lt;br /&gt;Market performance +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;Manager B +5%-5%&lt;br /&gt;Manager C +20%-20%&lt;br /&gt;Manager B i&lt;br /&gt;s  just    a no  -alpha    manager with a beta of 0.5, and manager C  is a no-alpha    manager with a &lt;br /&gt;beta of 2.0.   You could get the same results as manager B by putting half your capital in an index fund &lt;br /&gt;and keeping  the rest under your mattress and in the case of manager C,   by doubling your investment with &lt;br /&gt;borrowed capital and putting   it  all in an index fund.    &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two    managers, however, do   have alpha, as they exhibit asymmetry:  &lt;br /&gt;Market performance +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;Manager D +17%-12%&lt;br /&gt;Manager E +9%-3%&lt;br /&gt;Both   managers’ re&lt;br /&gt;turns reflect more of the market’s gain in good times than they do its loss in bad ones   .  &lt;br /&gt;Manager D might be described as an aggressive manager with alpha; s he achieves 170% of the market’s &lt;br /&gt;return when the market rises but suffers only 120% of the loss when it falls.  Manager E is a defensive &lt;br /&gt;manager with alpha; his returns reflect 90% of the gain in an up market but  only 30% of the loss in a &lt;br /&gt;down market.  These asymmetries can only be attributed to the presence of alpha.   Risk  -tolerant clients &lt;br /&gt;will    prefer to invest with D, and risk  -averse ones    will    prefer E.   &lt;br /&gt;This mana&lt;br /&gt;ger is truly exceptional:  &lt;br /&gt;Market performance +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;Manager F +20%-5%&lt;br /&gt;She beat the m&lt;br /&gt;arket in both directions: She’s up more tha&lt;br /&gt;n the market when it rises and  down less when it &lt;br /&gt;falls  .  Sh e’s up so much in a good market that you might be tempted to describe her   as aggressive.  But &lt;br /&gt;since she’s    down less in a down market, that description won’t hold.   Either she doesn’t have a bias in &lt;br /&gt;terms of aggressiveness versus defensiveness  , or   her   alpha is great enough to offset it. &lt;br /&gt;Finally, here’s one&lt;br /&gt; of the greatest managers of all time:  &lt;br /&gt;Market performance +10%-10%&lt;br /&gt;Manager G +20%+5%&lt;br /&gt;Manager G  i&lt;br /&gt;s up in good and bad   markets alike.  He clearly doesn’t have an aggressiveness/defensiveness &lt;br /&gt;bias, since his performance is exceptional in both markets.  His alpha    is sufficient to enable him  to  buck &lt;br /&gt;the trend and achieve a positive return in a down year.  When you find Manager G, you should (a) do &lt;br /&gt;extensive due diligence regarding his   reported performance, (b) if    the numbers hold up, invest a lot of &lt;br /&gt;money with him , (c) hope he won’t accept so much money that his edge goes away, and (d) send   me   his &lt;br /&gt;number.  &lt;br /&gt;*  *        *&lt;br /&gt;What matters&lt;br /&gt; most?  Asymmetry. &lt;br /&gt;•In sum, asymme&lt;br /&gt;try  shows up in a manager’s ability to do very   well    when things go his way and&lt;br /&gt;not too bad when they don’t.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.13All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•A  great     adage says, “Never confuse brains and a bull market.”  Managers with the   skill needed to&lt;br /&gt;produce asymmetry  are special because they’re able to fashion good     gains from sources other&lt;br /&gt;than   market advances.&lt;br /&gt;•When you think about it, the active investment business is, at its heart, completely about&lt;br /&gt;asymmetry.  If a manager’s performance doesn’t exceed what can be explained by   market&lt;br /&gt;returns and his   relative risk posture –  which stem  s  from his choice of market sector, tactics,&lt;br /&gt;and  level of aggressiveness –  he   simply hasn’t earn  ed his fees.&lt;br /&gt;Without asymm&lt;br /&gt;etry (see Managers A, B,  and C on page 12), active management delivers no value and &lt;br /&gt;deserves no fees.  Indeed, all the choices an  active investor makes will be for naught if he    doesn’t &lt;br /&gt;possess superior skill or insight.  By definition, average investors and below-average investors don’t &lt;br /&gt;have alpha and can’t produce asymmetry.   &lt;br /&gt;The big questio&lt;br /&gt;n is how to achieve asymmetry.  Most of the things people focus on –  the  things I desc&lt;br /&gt;ribe &lt;br /&gt;on p  ages    one through nine   as not mattering – ca  n’t   provide it.   As I’ve said before, the average of all &lt;br /&gt;investors’ thinking produces market prices and, obviously, average performance.  Asymmetry can only &lt;br /&gt;be demonstrated by the   relatively few people with superior skill    and insight.  The key lies in finding &lt;br /&gt;them  . &lt;br /&gt;November 22, &lt;br /&gt;2022&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.14All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   Sea Change &lt;br /&gt;sea change (idiom): a complete transformation, a radical change of direction in  attitude, &lt;br /&gt;goals    . . .   (Grammarist) &lt;br /&gt;In my 53 years in the&lt;br /&gt; investment world, I’ve seen a number of economic cycles, pendulum swings, &lt;br /&gt;manias and panics, bubbles and crashes, but I remember only   two  real sea changes.  I  think we may &lt;br /&gt;be in the midst of a third one    today. &lt;br /&gt;As I’ve recounte&lt;br /&gt;d many times in my memos, when I joined the investment management industry in 1969, &lt;br /&gt;many banks –  like the one I worked for at the time –  focused their equity portfolios on the so-called &lt;br /&gt;“Nifty Fifty.”  The Nifty Fifty comprised the stocks of companies that were considered the best and &lt;br /&gt;fastest-growing –  so good that nothing bad could ever happen to them.  For these stocks, everyone was &lt;br /&gt;sure there was “no price too high.”  But if you bought the Nifty Fifty when I started at the bank and held &lt;br /&gt;them until 1974, you were sitting on losses of more than 90% . . . from owning pieces of the best &lt;br /&gt;companies in America.  Perceived quality, it turned out, wasn’t synonymous with safety or with &lt;br /&gt;successful investment. &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, over&lt;br /&gt; in bond-land, a security with a rating of single-B was described by Moody’s as “failing &lt;br /&gt;to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment.”  Non-investment grade bonds –  those rated &lt;br /&gt;double-B and below –  were off-limits to fiduciaries, since proper financial behavior mandated the &lt;br /&gt;avoidance of risk.  For this reason, what soon became known as high yield bonds couldn’t be sold as new &lt;br /&gt;issues.  But in the mid-1970s, Michael Milken and a few others had the idea that it should be possible to &lt;br /&gt;issue non-investment grade bonds –  and    to invest in them prudently –  if the bonds offered enough interest &lt;br /&gt;to compensate for the risk of default.  In 1978, I started investing in these securities –  the bonds of &lt;br /&gt;perhaps America’s riskiest public companies –  and I was making money steadily and safely.      &lt;br /&gt;In other words, w&lt;br /&gt;hereas prudent bond investing had previously consisted of buying only &lt;br /&gt;presumedly safe investment grade bonds, investment managers could now prudently buy bonds of &lt;br /&gt;almost any quality as long    as they were adequately compensated for the attendant risk.  The U.S. &lt;br /&gt;high yield bond universe amounted to about $2 billion when I first got involved, and today    it stands at &lt;br /&gt;roughly $1.2 trillion.   &lt;br /&gt;This clearly re&lt;br /&gt;presented a major change in direction for the business of investing.  But that’s not the end &lt;br /&gt;of it.  Prior to the inception of high yield bond issuance, companies could only be acquired by larger firms &lt;br /&gt;– those that were able to pay with cash on hand or borrow large amounts of money and still retain their&lt;br /&gt;investment grade ratings.  But with the ability to issue high yield bonds, smaller firms could now acquire&lt;br /&gt;larger ones by using heavy leverage, since there was no longer a need to possess or maintain an&lt;br /&gt;investment grade rating.  This change permitted, in particular, the growth of leveraged buyouts and what’s&lt;br /&gt;now called the private equity industry.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most important aspect of this    change didn’t relate to high yield bonds, or to private &lt;br /&gt;equity, but   rather to  the adoption of a new investor mentality.  Now risk wasn’t necessarily &lt;br /&gt;avoided,     but rather considered relative to return and hopefully borne intelligently.  This new risk/&lt;br /&gt;return mindset was critical in the development of many new types of investment, such as distressed &lt;br /&gt;d&lt;br /&gt;ebt, mortgage backed securities, structured credit, and private lending.  It’s no exaggeration to say &lt;br /&gt;today’s investment world bears almost no resemblance to that of 50 years ago.  Young people joining &lt;br /&gt;the   industry t&lt;br /&gt;oday would likely be   shocked to learn that, back then, investors didn’t think in &lt;br /&gt;risk/return    terms.   Now that’s all w  e d o.  Ergo, a sea change. &lt;br /&gt;At r  oughly &lt;br /&gt;the s   a&lt;br /&gt;me t   ime,    big changes were   underway in the macroeconomic world.     I  think it all s tarted &lt;br /&gt;with t he  OPEC oil e mbargo of 1 973-74, w   hic h caused the pr  ice   of a barrel    of  oil t  o  jump from roughly &lt;br /&gt;$&lt;br /&gt;24   to almost $6 5 in less than a year.    This    spike raised the cost of    many goods and   ignite d rapid &lt;br /&gt;inflation.     Because the U   .S.   private sector in t  he   1970s was m  uch more   unionized tha n it i s n ow  and many &lt;br /&gt;collective bargaining agreements contained automatic cost-o&lt;br /&gt;f-living adjustments, rising inflation triggered &lt;br /&gt;wage increases, w hich    exacerbated inflation a   nd   led   to y  et m  ore wage increases.  This seemingly &lt;br /&gt;un stoppable upward    spiral kindled strong inflationary expectations, which   in many cases became self   -&lt;br /&gt;fulfilling, as is t heir nature. &lt;br /&gt;The year-o&lt;br /&gt;ver  -year i   ncrease in t  he C  on sumer Price Index, whic   h was 3.2% i  n 1972, rose t   o 11.0% by &lt;br /&gt;1974, receded to the   range of 6-9%   for   four years, a   nd t hen rebounded to 11.4% in 1979 and 13.5% in &lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt;980.     There was  great     despair, as n o relief was forthcoming from i  nflation-fighting tools ranging f  rom &lt;br /&gt;WIN (“Whip Inflation Now”) buttons to price controls to a f ederal funds rate t  hat r  eached 13% i   n 1 974. &lt;br /&gt;It t ook t   h&lt;br /&gt;e a ppointment of P  aul V   olcker as F  ed chairman in 1979 and the d  etermination he s  howe  d in &lt;br /&gt;raising the fed   funds rate    to 20% in 1980 to get inflation under control and    extinguish inflationary &lt;br /&gt;psychology.  As a result, inflation was back down to 3  .2%    by the   end of 1983. &lt;br /&gt;Volcker’s success in bringing inflation under c  ontrol allowed the Fed to r edu  ce th e fed funds rat e to  the &lt;br /&gt;high single digits and keep it  there ov&lt;br /&gt;er t  he r est   of t  he   1980s, before dropping it to the mid- single digits    in &lt;br /&gt;th e ’90s.   His a   ctions ushere   d in a d eclining-interest-rat  e environment that p   rev  ailed for  four &lt;br /&gt;decades (much more on this i  n t he   section that    follows).  I consider thi s the second sea change I’ve &lt;br /&gt;seen in m y  career.   &lt;br /&gt;The l   ong -te&lt;br /&gt;rm   decline in i  nterest rates    began just a few years   after the advent of  risk/return &lt;br /&gt;thinking, a nd I view    the c   ombination of t  he t  wo as h  aving given rise t   o (a) the rebirth of optimism &lt;br /&gt;among investors, (b)   the pursuit of pr ofit    through aggressive investment vehicles, and    (c) a  n &lt;br /&gt;incredible four decades for   the   stock market.  The S&amp;P 500 Index rose f   rom    a  low of  102 in Augu st &lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt;982 to 4,796 at the beginning of 2022,   for a compound annual return of 10.3% per  year.     What a period! &lt;br /&gt;Ther  e can   be n  o  greater financial and i  nvestment career luck t  han    to  have participated in  it. &lt;br /&gt;An   Incredible Tailwi&lt;br /&gt;nd &lt;br /&gt;What are th  e factors that g   ave  rise to investors’ success over t   he last 40 y ears?  We s   aw   major &lt;br /&gt;contributions from (   a) t  he e  conomic growth and&lt;br /&gt; preeminence of the U   .S.; (   b) t he i ncredible performance &lt;br /&gt;of  our g   reatest companies; (c) g  ain s i n technology, productivity and management techniques; and   (d) t  he &lt;br /&gt;benefits of globalization.  However, I’d b  e surprised if  40   year  s of declining   interest rates didn’t play &lt;br /&gt;the greatest   role of a ll. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, I had a loan from a Chicago bank, with an interest rate of “three-quarters over prime.”  (We &lt;br /&gt;don’t hear much about the prime rate anymore, but it was the benchmark interest rate –  the predecessor of &lt;br /&gt;LIBOR –  at which the money-center banks would lend to their best customers.)  I received a notice from &lt;br /&gt;the bank each time my rate changed, and I framed the one that marked the high point in December 1980: &lt;br /&gt;It told me the interest rate on my loan had risen to 22.25%!  Four decades later, I was able to borrow at &lt;br /&gt;just 2.25%, fixed for 10 years.  This represented a decline of 2,000 basis points.  Miraculous! &lt;br /&gt;What are the effect&lt;br /&gt;s of declining interest rates? &lt;br /&gt;•They acceler&lt;br /&gt;ate the growth of the economy by making it cheaper for consumers to buy on credit&lt;br /&gt;and for companies to invest in facilities, equipment, and inventory.&lt;br /&gt;•They provide a subsidy to borrowers (at the expense of lenders and savers).&lt;br /&gt;•They reduce businesses’ cost of capital and thus increase their profitability.&lt;br /&gt;•They increase the fair value of assets.  (The theoretical value of an asset is defined as the&lt;br /&gt;discounted present value of its future cash flows.  The lower the discount rate, the higher the&lt;br /&gt;present value.)  Thus, as interest rates fall, valuation parameters such as p/e ratios and enterprise&lt;br /&gt;values rise, and cap rates on real estate decline.&lt;br /&gt;•They reduce the prospective returns investors demand from investments they’re considering,&lt;br /&gt;thereby increasing the prices they’ll pay.  This can be seen most directly in the bond market –&lt;br /&gt;everyone knows it’s “rates down; prices up” –  but it works throughout the investment world.&lt;br /&gt;•By lifting asset prices, they create a “wealth effect” that makes people feel richer and thus more&lt;br /&gt;willing to spend.&lt;br /&gt;•Finally, by simultaneously increasing asset values and reducing borrowing costs, they produce a&lt;br /&gt;bonanza for those who buy assets using leverage.&lt;br /&gt;I want to spend m&lt;br /&gt;ore time on that last point.  Think about a buyer who employs leverage in a declining-&lt;br /&gt;rate environment: &lt;br /&gt;•He   analyzes a co&lt;br /&gt;mpany, concludes that he can make 10% a year on it, and decides to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;•Then he asks his head of capital markets how much it would cost to borrow 75%   of the money.&lt;br /&gt;When he’s told it’s 8%, it’s full speed ahead.  Earning 10% on three-quarters of the capital that’s&lt;br /&gt;borrowed at 8% would lever up the return on the other one-quarter (his equity) to 16%.&lt;br /&gt;•Banks compete to make the loan, and the result is an interest rate of 7% instead of 8%, making&lt;br /&gt;the investment even more profitable (a 19% levered return).&lt;br /&gt;•The interest cost on his floating-rate debt declines over time, and when his fixed-rate debt&lt;br /&gt;matures, he finds he can roll it over at 5%.  Now the deal is a home run (a 25% levered return, all&lt;br /&gt;else being equal).&lt;br /&gt;This narrative&lt;br /&gt; ignores the beneficial impact of declining interest rates on both the profitability of the &lt;br /&gt;company he bought and the market value of that company.  Is it any wonder then that private equity and &lt;br /&gt;other levered strategies enjoyed great success over the last 40 years? &lt;br /&gt;In a recent vi&lt;br /&gt;sit with clients, I came up with a bit of imagery to convey my view of the effect of the &lt;br /&gt;pro l&lt;br /&gt;onged decline in interest rates: At some airports, there’s a moving walkway, and standing on it makes &lt;br /&gt;life easier for the weary traveler.  But if rather than stand still on it, you walk at your normal pace, you &lt;br /&gt;move ahead rapidly.  That’s because your rate of travel over the ground is the sum of the speed at which &lt;br /&gt;you’re walking plus   the speed at which the walkway is moving. &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I think happened to investors over the last 40 years.  They enjoyed the growth of the &lt;br /&gt;economy and the companies they invested in, as well as the resulting increase in the value of their &lt;br /&gt;ownership stakes.  But in addition, they were on a moving walkway, carried along by declining interest &lt;br /&gt;rates.  The results have been great, but I doubt many people fully understand where they came from.  It &lt;br /&gt;seems to me that a significant portion of all the   money investors made over this period resulted &lt;br /&gt;from the tailwind generated by the massive drop   in  interest rate  s.    I consider it nearly impossible to &lt;br /&gt;overstate the influence of declining rates over the last four decades. &lt;br /&gt;The    Recent Experie&lt;br /&gt;nce   &lt;br /&gt;The period betwee&lt;br /&gt;n the end of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2009 and the onset of the pandemic in &lt;br /&gt;early 2020 was marked by ultra-low interest rates, and the macroeconomic environment –  and its effects – &lt;br /&gt;were highly unusual.   &lt;br /&gt;An   all -time    low in interest rates was   reached whe n the F   ed c  ut t  he f  ed funds rate t   o approximately zer  o in &lt;br /&gt;late   2008 &lt;br /&gt;in an   effort to pull the economy out of the GFC.  The low rates were accompanied by &lt;br /&gt;quantitative easing: purchases of bonds undertaken by the Fed to inject liquidity into the economy (and &lt;br /&gt;perhaps to keep investors from panicki&lt;br /&gt;ng) .  The effects were dramatic: &lt;br /&gt;•The    low    rates and va&lt;br /&gt;st amounts of liquidity stimulated the economy and triggered explosive gains&lt;br /&gt;in the markets.&lt;br /&gt;•Strong economic growth and lower interest costs added to corporate profits.&lt;br /&gt;•Valuation parameters rose, as described above, lifting asset prices.  Stocks increased non-stop for&lt;br /&gt;more than ten years, except for a handful of downdrafts that each lasted a few months.  From a&lt;br /&gt;low of 667 in March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 reached a high of 3,386 in February 2020, for a&lt;br /&gt;compound return of 16% per year.&lt;br /&gt;•The markets’ strength encouraged investors to drop their crisis-inspired risk aversion and&lt;br /&gt;return to risk taking much sooner than expected.  It also made FOMO –  the fear of missing&lt;br /&gt;out   –  the prevalent emotion among investors.  Buyers were eager to buy, and holders&lt;br /&gt;weren’t motivated to sell.&lt;br /&gt;•Investors’ revived desire to buy caused the capital markets to reopen, making it cheap and easy&lt;br /&gt;for companies to obtain financing.  Lenders’ eagerness to put money to work enabled borrowers&lt;br /&gt;to pay low interest rates under less-restrictive documentation that reduced lender protections.&lt;br /&gt;•The paltry yields on safe investments drove investors to buy riskier assets.&lt;br /&gt;•Thanks to economic growth and plentiful liquidity, there were few defaults and bankruptcies.&lt;br /&gt;•The main exogenous influences were    increasing globalization and the limited extent of armed&lt;br /&gt;conflict around the world.   Both influences were clearly salutary.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, i&lt;br /&gt;n this period, the U.S. enjoyed its longest economic recovery in history (albeit also one of its &lt;br /&gt;slowest) and its longest bull market, exceeding ten years in both cases. &lt;br /&gt;When the Covid-19 pandemic caused much of the world’s economy to be shut down, the Fed dusted off &lt;br /&gt;the rescue plan that had taken months to formulate and implement during the GFC and put it into effect in &lt;br /&gt;a matter of weeks at a much larger scale than its earlier version.  The U.S. government chipped in with &lt;br /&gt;loans and vast relief payments (on top of its customary deficit spending).  The result in the period from &lt;br /&gt;March 2020 to the end of 2021 was a complete replay of the post-GFC developments enumerated above, &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including a quick economic bounce and an even quicker market recovery.  (The S&amp;P 500 rose from its &lt;br /&gt;low of 2,237 in March 2020 to 4,796 on the first day of 2022, up 114% in less than two years.)  &lt;br /&gt;For    what felt lik&lt;br /&gt;e eons – from October 2012 to February 2020 –  my standard presentation was &lt;br /&gt;titled “Investing in a Low Return World,” because that’s what our circumstances were.   With the &lt;br /&gt;prospective returns on many asset classes –  especially credit – at all   -time lows, I enumerated the principal &lt;br /&gt;options available to investors:  &lt;br /&gt;•invest as you pre&lt;br /&gt;viously have,  and accept that your  returns will be lower than they used to be;&lt;br /&gt;•reduce risk to prepare for a market correction, and accept a return that is lower still;&lt;br /&gt;•go t  o cash and earn a return of zero, hoping the market will decline and thus offer higher returns&lt;br /&gt;(and do it soon); or&lt;br /&gt;•ramp up your risk in pursuit of higher returns.&lt;br /&gt;Each of these ch&lt;br /&gt;oices had serious flaws, and there’s a good reason for that.  By definition, it’s hard to &lt;br /&gt;achieve good returns dependably and safely in a low-return world. &lt;br /&gt;Regular reader&lt;br /&gt;s of my memos know that my observations regarding the investment environment are &lt;br /&gt;primarily based on impressions and inferences rather than data.  Thus, in recent meetings, I’ve been using &lt;br /&gt;the following list of properties to describe the  period in question.  (Think about whether you agree with &lt;br /&gt;this description.  I’ll return to it later.) &lt;br /&gt;2009 to 2021 &lt;br /&gt;Fed behavior Highly stimulative &lt;br /&gt;Inflation Dormant &lt;br /&gt;Economic outlook Positive &lt;br /&gt;Likelihood of distress Minimal &lt;br /&gt;Mood Optimistic &lt;br /&gt;Buyers Eager &lt;br /&gt;Holders Complacent &lt;br /&gt;Key worry FOMO &lt;br /&gt;Risk aversion Absent &lt;br /&gt;Credit window Wide open &lt;br /&gt;Financing Plentiful &lt;br /&gt;Interest rates Lowest ever &lt;br /&gt;Yield spreads Modest &lt;br /&gt;Prospective returns Lowest ever &lt;br /&gt;The overall peri&lt;br /&gt;od from 2009 through 2021 (with the exception of a few months in 2020) was one in &lt;br /&gt;which optimism prevailed among investors and worry was minimal.  Low inflation allowed central &lt;br /&gt;bankers to maintain generous monetary policies.   These were golden times for corporations and asset &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;owners thanks to good economic growth, cheap and easily accessible capital, and freedom f  rom    distress.  &lt;br /&gt;This was an a sset owner’s market and    a  borrower’s market   .  With the risk-free&lt;br /&gt; r ate a   t z ero,    fear    of &lt;br /&gt;loss absent, and    people eager to make risky investments, it was a frustrating period for  lenders a  nd &lt;br /&gt;bargain hunters.     &lt;br /&gt;On r   ecent visits with clients, I’ve  been describing Oaktree as  having spent the   years 2009 through 2019 &lt;br /&gt;“in the wilderness” given    our   focus on credit and our heavy emphasis on value investing an d risk    control. &lt;br /&gt;To illustrate, after   raising our largest fund up to that time    in 2007-08 an   d&lt;br /&gt; putting most of it  to w  ork very &lt;br /&gt;successfully in t  he w ake of the L   ehman Brothers bankruptcy,    we   thought it a ppropriate, given th e &lt;br /&gt;investment environment, to cut   the   amount in h  alf f  or  its s  uccessor fund and h   alve i   t a gain for the f  und &lt;br /&gt;after  that.     Oaktree’s total    assets under management grew r  elatively little    during this p  eriod  , and the &lt;br /&gt;r&lt;br /&gt;eturns on most of our  closed-end f   unds, a  lthough fine, were   moderate by our standards.  It felt like a &lt;br /&gt;lon g slog  . &lt;br /&gt;T&lt;br /&gt;hat Was T  h&lt;br /&gt;en .  This Is N o&lt;br /&gt;w. &lt;br /&gt;Of c  ourse, all   of t  he a  bove flippe  d in t  he l ast y  ear or so.    Most importantly, inflation began to r ear i   ts h  ead &lt;br /&gt;in early 2021, when our emergence from    isolation permitted too much money (savings amassed by people &lt;br /&gt;shut i   n&lt;br /&gt; at h  ome, i   ncluding distributions from    massive Covid-19 r elief programs) to chase too f ew   goods &lt;br /&gt;and services (with supply hampered by t  he u neven restart of m  anufacturing and transportation).  Because &lt;br /&gt;the F   ed deemed t   he i  nflation “transitory,” it c o&lt;br /&gt;ntinued its policies of l ow   interest rates and   quantitative &lt;br /&gt;easing, keeping money loose.  These policies further s  timulated demand (especially for   homes) at a t  ime &lt;br /&gt;whe n it d idn’t    need stimulating.   &lt;br /&gt;Inflation worsened&lt;br /&gt; as  2021 wore  on,   an d late i   n the   year,    the F   ed acknowledged that it w asn’t likely to be &lt;br /&gt;short   -lived.     Thus, the F   ed s  tarted reducing its purchases of bonds in November and   began raising interest &lt;br /&gt;rates  in March 2022, kicking off one of t   he q  ui&lt;br /&gt;ckest rate  -hiking cycles on r  ecord.  The stock market, &lt;br /&gt;which had ignored inflation and rising interest rates for most of 2021, began to fall around year-end.    &lt;br /&gt;From there, events followed a predictable course.  As I wrote in  the memo On the Couch (January &lt;br /&gt;2016)&lt;br /&gt;, whereas events in t he real world    fluctuate between “pretty good”     and    “not so h ot,”    investor &lt;br /&gt;sen timent &lt;br /&gt;often careens from “flawless” to “hopeless” as events t hat were   previously viewed as &lt;br /&gt;benign come to be interpreted as c  atastrophic.   &lt;br /&gt;•Higher interest rat&lt;br /&gt;es led to higher demanded returns.  Thus, stocks that had seemed fairly valued&lt;br /&gt;when interest rates were minimal fell to lower p/e ratios that were commensurate with higher&lt;br /&gt;rate  s.&lt;br /&gt;•Likewise, the massive increase in interest rates had its usual depressing effect on bond prices.&lt;br /&gt;•Falling stock and bond prices caused FOMO to dry up and fear of loss to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;•The markets’  decline gathered steam, and the things that had done best in 2020 and 2021 (tech,&lt;br /&gt;software, SPACs, and cryptocurrency) now did the   worst, further dampening psychology.&lt;br /&gt;•Exogenous events have the ability to undercut the market’s mood, especially in tougher times,&lt;br /&gt;and in 2022 the biggest such event was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;br /&gt;•The Ukraine conflict reduced supplies of grain and oil &amp; gas, adding to inflationary pressures.&lt;br /&gt;•Since the tighter monetary policies were designed to slow the economy, investors focused on the&lt;br /&gt;difficulty the Fed would likely have achieving a soft landing, and thus the strong likelihood of a&lt;br /&gt;recession.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•The anticipated effect of that recession on earnings dampened investors’ spirits.  Thus, the fall of&lt;br /&gt;the S&amp;P 500 over the first nine months of 2022 rivaled the greatest full-year declines of the last&lt;br /&gt;century.  (It has now recovered a fair bit.)&lt;br /&gt;•The expectation of a recession also increased the fear of rising debt defaults.&lt;br /&gt;•New security issuance became difficult.&lt;br /&gt;•Having committed to fund buyouts in a    lower-interest-rate   environment, banks found themselves&lt;br /&gt;with many billions of dollars of “hung” bridge loans unsaleable at par.  These loans have saddled&lt;br /&gt;the banks with big losses.&lt;br /&gt;•The se hung loans forced banks to reduce the amounts they could commit to new deals, making it&lt;br /&gt;harder for buyers to finance acquisitions.&lt;br /&gt;The progression&lt;br /&gt; of events described above caused pessimism to take over from optimism.  The market &lt;br /&gt;characterized by easy money and upbeat borrowers and asset owners disappeared; now lenders and buyers &lt;br /&gt;held better cards.  Credit investors became able to demand higher returns and better creditor protections.  &lt;br /&gt;The list of candidates for distress –  loans and bonds offering yield spreads of more than 1,000 basis points &lt;br /&gt;over Treasurys –  grew from dozens to hundreds.  Here’s how the change in the environment looks to me: &lt;br /&gt;2009 to 2021 Today &lt;br /&gt;Fed behavior Highly stimulative Tightening &lt;br /&gt;Inflation Dormant 40-year high &lt;br /&gt;Economic outlook Positive Recession likely &lt;br /&gt;Likelihood of distress Minimal Rising &lt;br /&gt;Mood Optimistic Guarded &lt;br /&gt;Buyers Eager Hesitant &lt;br /&gt;Holders Complacent Uncertain &lt;br /&gt;Key worry FOMO Investment losses &lt;br /&gt;Risk aversion Absent Rising &lt;br /&gt;Credit window Wide open Constricted &lt;br /&gt;Financing Plentiful Scarce &lt;br /&gt;Interest rates Lowest ever More normal &lt;br /&gt;Yield spreads Modest Normal &lt;br /&gt;Prospective returns Lowest ever More than ample &lt;br /&gt;If the right-hand column accurately describes the new environment, as I believe it does, then we’re &lt;br /&gt;witnessing a complete reversal of the conditions in the middle column, which prevailed in 2021 and late &lt;br /&gt;2020 , throughout the 2009-19 period, and for   much of the   last 40 years.   &lt;br /&gt;How has this chan&lt;br /&gt;ge manifested itself in investment options?  Here’s one example: In the low-return &lt;br /&gt;world of just one year ago, high yield bonds offered yields of 4-5%.  A lot of issuance was at yields in the &lt;br /&gt;3s, and at least one new bond came to the market with a “handle” of 2.  The usefulness of these bonds for &lt;br /&gt;institutions needing returns of 6 or 7% was quite limited.  Today these securities yield roughly 8%, &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaning even after allowing for some defaults, they’re likely to deliver equity-like returns, sourced from &lt;br /&gt;contractual cash flows on public securities.  Credit instruments of all kinds are potentially poised to &lt;br /&gt;deliver performance that can help investors accomplish their goals. &lt;br /&gt;The Outlook &lt;br /&gt;Inflation and&lt;br /&gt; interest rates are highly likely to remain the dominant considerations influencing the &lt;br /&gt;investment environment for the next several years.  While history shows that no one can predict inflation, &lt;br /&gt;it seems likely to remain higher than what we became used to after the GFC, at least for a while.  The &lt;br /&gt;course of interest rates will largely be determined by the Fed’s progress in bringing inflation under &lt;br /&gt;control.  If rates go much higher in that process, they’re likely to come back down afterward, but no one &lt;br /&gt;can predict the timing or the extent of the decrease. &lt;br /&gt;While everyone&lt;br /&gt; knows how little I think of macro forecasts, a number of clients have asked recently &lt;br /&gt;about my views regarding the future of interest rates.  Thus, I’ll provide a brief overview.  (Oaktree’s &lt;br /&gt;investment philosophy doesn’t prohibit having opinions, just acting as if they’re right.)  In   my view, the &lt;br /&gt;buyers who’ve driven the S&amp;P 500’s recent 10% rally from the October low have been motivated by their &lt;br /&gt;beliefs that (a) inflation is easing, (b) the Fed will soon pivot from restrictive policy back toward &lt;br /&gt;stimulative, (c) interest rates will return to lower levels, (d) a recession will be averted, or it will be &lt;br /&gt;modest and brief, and (e) the economy and markets will return to halcyon days.   &lt;br /&gt;In contrast, &lt;br /&gt;here’s what I think: &lt;br /&gt;•The underlying c&lt;br /&gt;auses of today’s inflation will probably abate as relief-swollen savings are spent&lt;br /&gt;and as supply catches up with demand.&lt;br /&gt;•While some recent inflation readings have been encouraging in this regard, the labor market is&lt;br /&gt;still very tight, wages are rising, and the economy is growing strongly.&lt;br /&gt;•Globalization is slowing or reversing.  If this trend continues, we will lose its significant&lt;br /&gt;deflationary influence.  (Importantly, consumer durables prices declined by 40% over the years&lt;br /&gt;1995 -2020, no doubt thanks to less-expensive imports.  I estimate that this took 0.6% per year off&lt;br /&gt;the rate of inflation.)&lt;br /&gt;•Before declaring victory on inflation, the Fed will need to be convinced not only that inflation has&lt;br /&gt;settled near th&lt;br /&gt;e 2% target, but also that inflationary psychology has been extinguished.  To&lt;br /&gt;accomplish this, the Fed will likely want to see a positive real   fed funds rate –  at present it’s&lt;br /&gt;minus 2.2%.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus, while the Fed appears likely to slow the pace of its interest rate increases, it’s unlikely to&lt;br /&gt;return to stimulative policies any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;•The Fed has to maintain credibility (or regain it after having claimed for too long that inflation&lt;br /&gt;was “transitory”).  It can’t appear to be inconstant by becoming stimulative too soon after having&lt;br /&gt;turned restrictive.&lt;br /&gt;•The Fed faces the question of what to do about its balance sheet, which grew from $4 trillion to&lt;br /&gt;almost $9 trillion due to its purchases of bonds.   Allowing its holdings of bonds to mature and roll&lt;br /&gt;off (or, somewhat less likely, making sales) would withdraw significant liquidity from the&lt;br /&gt;economy, restricting growth.&lt;br /&gt;•Rather than be in a stimulative posture on a perpetual basis, one might imagine the Fed would&lt;br /&gt;prefer to normally maintain a “neutral interest rate,” which is defined as neither stimulative nor&lt;br /&gt;restrictive.  (I know I would.)  Most recently –  last summer –  that rate was estimated at 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Similarly, although most of us believe the free market is the best allocator of economic resources,&lt;br /&gt;we haven’t had a free market in money for well over a decade.  The Fed might prefer to reduce its&lt;br /&gt;role in capital allocation by being less active in controlling rates and holding mortgage bonds.&lt;br /&gt;•There must be risks associated with the Fed keeping interest rates stimulative on a long-term&lt;br /&gt;basis.  Arguably, we’ve seen most recently that doing so can bring on inflation, though the&lt;br /&gt;inflation of the last two years can be attributed largely to one-off  events related to the pandemic.&lt;br /&gt;•The Fed would probably like to see normal interest rates high enough to provide it with room to&lt;br /&gt;cut if it needs to stimulate the economy in the future.&lt;br /&gt;•People who came into the business world after 2008 –  or veteran investors with short memories –&lt;br /&gt;might think of today’s interest rates as elevated.  But they’re not in the longer sweep of history,&lt;br /&gt;meaning there’s no obvious reason why they should be lower.&lt;br /&gt;These are the reason  s  why I believe that the base interest rate over the next several years is more &lt;br /&gt;likely to average 2- 4% (i.e., not far from where it is now) than 0-2%.  Of course, there are &lt;br /&gt;counterarguments.  But, for me, the bottom line is that highly stimulative rates are likely not in the cards &lt;br /&gt;for the next several years, barring a serious recession from which we need rescuing (and that would have &lt;br /&gt;ramifications of its own).  But I assure you Oaktree isn’t going to bet money on that belief. &lt;br /&gt;What we do know &lt;br /&gt;is that inflation and interest rates are higher today than they’ve been for 40 and 13 &lt;br /&gt;years, respectively.  No one knows how long the items in the right-hand column above will continue to &lt;br /&gt;accurately describe the environment.  They’ll be influenced by economic growth, inflation, and interest &lt;br /&gt;rates, as well as exogenous events, all of which are unpredictable.  Regardless, I think things will &lt;br /&gt;generally be less rosy in the years immediately ahead:  &lt;br /&gt;•A recession i&lt;br /&gt;n the next 12-18 months appears to be a foregone conclusion among economists and&lt;br /&gt;investors.&lt;br /&gt;•That recession is likely to coincide with deterioration of corporate earnings and investor&lt;br /&gt;psychology.&lt;br /&gt;•Credit market conditions for new financings seem unlikely to soon become as accommodative as&lt;br /&gt;they were in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;•No one can foretell how high the debt default rate  will    rise or how long it’ll stay there.  It’s worth&lt;br /&gt;noting in this context that the annual default rate on high yield bonds averaged 3.6% from 1978&lt;br /&gt;through 2009, but an unusually low 2.1% under the “just-right” conditions that prevailed for the&lt;br /&gt;decade 2010-19.  In fact, there was only one year in that decade in which defaults reached the&lt;br /&gt;historical average.&lt;br /&gt;•Lastly, there is a forecast I’m confident of:   Interest rates aren’t about to decline by another&lt;br /&gt;2,000 basis points from here.&lt;br /&gt;As I’ve written &lt;br /&gt;many times about the economy and markets, we never know where we’re going, but &lt;br /&gt;we   ought to know where we are.   The bottom line for me is that,  in many ways, conditions at this &lt;br /&gt;moment are  overwhelmingly different from –  and mostly less favorable than –  those of the post-GFC &lt;br /&gt;climate described above.  These changes may be long-lasting, or they may wear off over time.  But in my &lt;br /&gt;view, we’re unlikely to quickly see the   same optimism and ease that marked the post-GFC period.   &lt;br /&gt;We’ve gone from&lt;br /&gt; the low-return world of 2009   -21 to a full-return world, and it may become more &lt;br /&gt;so in the near term.  Investors can now potentially get solid returns from credit instruments, &lt;br /&gt;meaning they no longer have to rely as heavily on riskier investments to achieve their overall return &lt;br /&gt;targets.  Lenders and bargain hunters face much better prospects in this changed environment than &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they did in 2009-21.    And importantly, if you grant that the environment is and may continue to be &lt;br /&gt;very different from what it was over the last 13 years –  and most of the last 40 years –  it should &lt;br /&gt;follow that the investment strategies that worked best over those periods may not be the ones that &lt;br /&gt;outperform in the years ahead. &lt;br /&gt;That’s the sea&lt;br /&gt; change I’m talking about. &lt;br /&gt;December 13, 2022 &lt;br /&gt;2022 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   Taking the Temper&lt;br /&gt;ature    &lt;br /&gt;In  preparation for m  y  interview fo&lt;br /&gt;r “ Lunch w  ith t  he F  T” last fall, I sent   the reporter, Harriet Agnew, five &lt;br /&gt;memos I  had written between 2000 and 2020 that contained market     calls.  How were t   hey chosen?  First, I &lt;br /&gt;felt t   h&lt;br /&gt;e m emos accurately conveyed my  thinking at t  he k ey t  urni  ng points in that 20-year period   .  And &lt;br /&gt;second, my c   alls   turned out t o be   right.   &lt;br /&gt;Five C alls &lt;br /&gt;I’ve w ritten before about the t  ime i   n&lt;br /&gt; 2017 when I was w  orking on my book Mastering the Market Cycle &lt;br /&gt;an d batting ideas    back and forth with my s   on Andrew.  I  said, “Yo u know, lookin   g back, I think my &lt;br /&gt;market    calls have   been about   right.”  His response was dead  on t  ar&lt;br /&gt;get as usual:    “Yeah, Dad, t hat’s &lt;br /&gt;because   you    did i   t f ive   times in  50 y  ears.”   It   struck me like an epiphany: He was 100% correct.   In &lt;br /&gt;those five i  nstances – around the p  ublication of the r  espective memos    – the markets were either crazily &lt;br /&gt;elevated or m assively depressed, and as  a result, I was a  bl e to r  ecommend becoming more d  efensive or &lt;br /&gt;more aggressive with a good    chance of b eing right.  (Before I go f ur&lt;br /&gt;ther , let m  e make i  t c lear t   hat w   hile &lt;br /&gt;hindsight shows t   hat   the   logic     behind those calls was c orre  ct, that doesn’t mean I made t   hem without &lt;br /&gt;great t   repidation.) &lt;br /&gt;To illustrate how one might a   pproach making market calls, I   ’m going to  briefly summarize what  led me &lt;br /&gt;to m  ake t   hose five c   alls.     (I’m not  going to go int o detail, since t   he c ontemporaneous memos I ci te  in ea ch &lt;br /&gt;section will supply more than enough for  those who’&lt;br /&gt;re i  nterested.)  As   you r   ead the description of e  ach &lt;br /&gt;event, look closely at ho  w t  he f  orces  that c   ontributed to – and r   esulted from – each episode led t  o  the   next &lt;br /&gt;on e.   You’ll be able t   o app reciate why I  ’ ve l   ong s   tressed the r  ole o   f  causality in m  arket c   ycles. &lt;br /&gt;January 2000 &lt;br /&gt;In the fall of 1999,    against the   backdrop of the m assive gains    being achieved in tech,    media, and t elecom &lt;br /&gt;stocks, I read   Edward Chancellor’s excellent book Devil Take the Hindmost.  I w as  struck by the &lt;br /&gt;similarities between the   TMT boom and the   historical bubbles that a   re t  he s  ub ject of that book.  The lure &lt;br /&gt;of  easy profits, the   willingness to leave one’s day job t   o cash in, the a  bility to invest blithely in money-&lt;br /&gt;losing companies whose business models one can’t    explain – all these felt like themes that had rhymed &lt;br /&gt;o&lt;br /&gt;ver t   he c  ourse of  financial history, leading to bubbles and  their painful bursting.  And    all   of t  hem   were &lt;br /&gt;visible in investor behavior as 19  99 came t o an end. &lt;br /&gt;Wh&lt;br /&gt;ile   I  wasn’t involved directly in equities and   Oaktree’s investments had little if a ny exposure to &lt;br /&gt;technology at the time, I observed many market narratives that I thought were too good to be true.  Thus, I &lt;br /&gt;said so in the memo bubble.com, which was    published as 2000 began.  The memo described how tech &lt;br /&gt;investors   were buying the   stocks of y  oung companies at  astronomical prices s   et  in m  any cases as  a &lt;br /&gt;multiple of c  urrent revenues, as t he c  ompanies often   had no profits.     In fact,    many had no revenues, in &lt;br /&gt;which case the price    was    based on l ittl&lt;br /&gt;e  more than a  concept and h ope.     I d efine a bubble as an  irrationally &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elevated opinion of an asset or sector, and the TMT craze of the late 1990s exemplified this definition.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus, I wrote as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In short, I find th&lt;br /&gt;e evidence of an overheated, speculative market in technology, Internet &lt;br /&gt;and telecommunications stocks overwhelming, as are the similarities to past manias. . . . &lt;br /&gt;To say technology, Internet and telecommunications stocks are too high and about to &lt;br /&gt;decline is comparable today to standing in front of a freight train.  To say they have &lt;br /&gt;benefited from a boom of colossal proportions and should be examined very skeptically &lt;br /&gt;is something I feel I owe you. &lt;br /&gt;In m  y opinion, the T  MT b   ubble burst   in e  a&lt;br /&gt;rly 2000 for no r  easo  n other than t   hat s  tock prices    had become &lt;br /&gt;un sustainably high.  The Standard &amp; Poor’s    500 I   ndex f   ell   by 46% from    its 2000 high   to th  e lo w  in  2002, &lt;br /&gt;and t   he tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite declined by 80% durin g this p   eriod.  Man   y tech stocks lost &lt;br /&gt;much more, and many young companies in fields such as e-commerce ended up becoming worthless.  &lt;br /&gt;An d the   word “b&lt;br /&gt;ubble” became part of e veryday speec   h for   a  new generation of investors. &lt;br /&gt;Late 2004 to Mid-2007 &lt;br /&gt;The aftermath o&lt;br /&gt;f t he   TMT bubble l   ed t  o an environment in the   mid-   aughts that f  elt   to me like   a s low -&lt;br /&gt;developing trainwreck, with a  n emphasis on “  slow -developing.”  I s tarte  d complaining too soon . .  . o r &lt;br /&gt;maybe my&lt;br /&gt; timing was r  easonable but t   he  negative consequences just    too k longer to d evelo   p than t   hey &lt;br /&gt;should have. &lt;br /&gt;In s  ummary, the Federal Reserve was e  ngaging in ac com&lt;br /&gt;modative monetary    policy – taking the f   ed funds &lt;br /&gt;rate    to new lows    – to battle the &lt;br /&gt;potential ramifications of the TMT bubble’s bursting.  Thus, in my &lt;br /&gt;memo Risk and Return Today from late 2004, I observed that (a) prospective returns on most asset &lt;br /&gt;classes were unusually low    and (b) risk-seeking on the pa&lt;br /&gt;rt of    investors looking to improve on those &lt;br /&gt;low    returns had   led them to embrace higher-risk and “alternative” investments.   &lt;br /&gt;I  identified some of these alternatives in the memo There They Go Again (May 2005), spending most of &lt;br /&gt;my t   ime discussing residential real estate, as that   was    where investors were embracing the most glaring &lt;br /&gt;fallacy: the belief that h   ome prices only&lt;br /&gt; go u  p.   I  als o discussed the t endency of investors to (a) i   gnore &lt;br /&gt;the lessons of p ast cycles,    (b)   fall   for   new developments, and (c) p  ile into risky    investments, guided by &lt;br /&gt;time  -honored platitudes such a   s “ it’s   different th&lt;br /&gt;is t  ime,” “higher risk means  higher returns,” or “if i t &lt;br /&gt;stops w  orking, I’ll  just g   e&lt;br /&gt;t o ut.”     Man  y of  these logical errors were being committed by investors in t he &lt;br /&gt;housing market. &lt;br /&gt;Th e driv&lt;br /&gt;ing f   o rce behind Oaktree’s behavior in t hat   period wasn’t    any o   f  th e above.  Rather, it w as  the &lt;br /&gt;fact t   hat m y O aktre   e co-founder Bruce Kars h and I were s  pending much of  each day trudging to each &lt;br /&gt;other’s offices to complain about the c razy    deals – ch aracterized by low returns, high risk for investors, &lt;br /&gt;and a lot of o  p&lt;br /&gt;tionality for   issuers – that were e   asily being brought to m arket.  “If d   eals    like t   his c  an   get &lt;br /&gt;done,” we agreed, “there’s something wrong with t  he m  arket.”  Few    people, we thought, were &lt;br /&gt;dem&lt;br /&gt;  onstrating prudence, discipline, value c   onsciousness, or the a  bility t  o resist the f  ear of missing out.  &lt;br /&gt;Investors a   re s  upposed to act a   s di sciplinarians, preventing undeserving securities from bein g issued, b ut &lt;br /&gt;in  those days, they weren’t performing that    function.  This signaled a w orrisome state of affairs. &lt;br /&gt;These observations – alon  g&lt;br /&gt; wit  h an   awareness of the ge nerally high prices and low prospective returns &lt;br /&gt;that prevailed at the time   – convinced us to dramatically increase our usual  emphasis on defensiveness.  In &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;response, we s ol d off l  arge amounts of a  ssets, liquidated large funds, organize   d small funds (or  none at all &lt;br /&gt;in c  ertain strategies), and significantly raised&lt;br /&gt; the   bar a   gainst whic h potential new   investments woul d be &lt;br /&gt;evaluated. &lt;br /&gt;In   July 2007, I published the memo It’s All Good, in which I was more emphatic (and had   better &lt;br /&gt;timing): &lt;br /&gt;Where do we stan&lt;br /&gt;d in the cycle?  In my opinion, there’s little mystery.  I see low levels of &lt;br /&gt;skepticism, fear and risk aversion.  Most people are willing to undertake risky &lt;br /&gt;investments, often because the promised returns from traditional, safe investments seem &lt;br /&gt;so meager.  This is true even though the lack of interest in safe investments and the &lt;br /&gt;acceptance of risky investments have rendered the slope of the risk/return line quite flat.  &lt;br /&gt;Risk premiums are generally the skimpiest I’ve ever seen, but few people are responding &lt;br /&gt;by refusing to accept incremental risk. . . . &lt;br /&gt;Eight months af&lt;br /&gt;ter I wrote It’s All Good, Bear Stearns melted down under the weight of funds that had &lt;br /&gt;invested in subprime mortgages.  Then, in mid-September we saw –  in rapid succession –  the rescue of &lt;br /&gt;Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the bailout of AIG.  The &lt;br /&gt;S&amp;P 500 Index fell to a low of 735 in February 2009, down 53% from its high of 1,549 reached in 2007 &lt;br /&gt;(and down 39% from its level around the time I put out the way-too -early Risk and Return Today).    &lt;br /&gt;Importantly, &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree had essentially no involvement with subprime mortgages or mortgage-backed &lt;br /&gt;securities.  Moreover, those assets were traded in a relatively remote corner of the investment world, and &lt;br /&gt;we had little appreciation for what was taking place there.  In other words, our cautious conclusions &lt;br /&gt;weren’t reached on the basis of subject-matter expertise but rather on an unusually good example &lt;br /&gt;of what I call “taking the temperature of the market” (see pages 9-10).      &lt;br /&gt;Late 2008 &lt;br /&gt;The world seem&lt;br /&gt;ed relatively tranquil as September 2008 began, but then Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy &lt;br /&gt;filing, mentioned above, took place mid-month.  The markets promptly fell apart, based on an apocalyptic &lt;br /&gt;view that Lehman’s failure was part of a logical progression that had started when Bear Stearns ceased to &lt;br /&gt;exist as an independent entity  and could eventually lead to a meltdown of the worldwide financial system. &lt;br /&gt;Complacency gave way to panic, and the Global Financial Crisis – in capital letters –  was upon us.     &lt;br /&gt;Anticipating that the reckless behavior we were witnessing (see the previous section) would ultimately &lt;br /&gt;create significant buying opportunities for our distressed debt strategy, Oaktree organized an $11 billion &lt;br /&gt;“reserve fund” for distressed debt between January 2007 and March 2008.  The fund was created to give &lt;br /&gt;us capital to invest if things reached crisis proportions, which by mid-2008, they had not.  Because its &lt;br /&gt;predecessor fund had only just become fully invested, we started to slowly invest the reserve fund prior to &lt;br /&gt;Lehman’s bankruptcy.  In the market panic that followed Lehman’s collapse, our first job was to figure &lt;br /&gt;out how best to proceed.  Should we continue to invest the fund’s capital or hold it in reserve?  Or should &lt;br /&gt;we step on the gas?  Was this the bottom?  How could we determine what lay ahead?  There was no &lt;br /&gt;history of financial sector meltdowns to rely on and no informed way to approach these questions given &lt;br /&gt;the uniqueness of the circumstances and the many unknowns.  With the future unknowable, we applied &lt;br /&gt;the only analytical framework we could think of (simplistic though it was):  &lt;br /&gt;I think the outl&lt;br /&gt;ook has to be viewed as binary: will the world end or won’t it?  If you &lt;br /&gt;can’t say yes, you have to say no and act accordingly.  In particular, saying it will end &lt;br /&gt;would lead to inaction, while saying it’s not going to will permit us to do the things that &lt;br /&gt;always have worked in the past.   &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will invest on  the a   ssumption that it will  g&lt;br /&gt;o on, that companies will m  ake  money, that &lt;br /&gt;they’ll have   value, and that b   uyin  g claims on t  hem at &lt;br /&gt;low prices will w  ork i  n the   long &lt;br /&gt;run.     What alternative is t here?    . . . &lt;br /&gt;No one s   eems able   to imagine how t   he c urrent vicious circle will be i  nterrupted.  But I &lt;br /&gt;think  we m  ust a  ssume it  will be. &lt;br /&gt;It  must   be noted that,    just    like two years    ago, people are accepting as  true something that &lt;br /&gt;has   never held true before.     Then,  it  was t   he proposition that  massively levered balance &lt;br /&gt;sheets had been rendered safe by the miracle of financial engineering.  Today, it’s the &lt;br /&gt;non-viability of the   essential financial sector and its greatest institutions. . . .   (Nobody &lt;br /&gt;Knows, September 19, 2008) &lt;br /&gt;The above re&lt;br /&gt;asoning led us to conclude that if we invested and the financial world melted down, it &lt;br /&gt;wouldn’t matter what we had done.  But if we didn’t invest and it didn’t melt down, we wouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;have done our job.   So, we made the unsupportable assumption that the financial world would continue &lt;br /&gt;to exist and concluded that this meant we should invest aggressively.  Bruce Karsh’s team plunged in, &lt;br /&gt;investing an average of $400 million a week from September 18, 2008 through year-end    –  a total of $6 &lt;br /&gt;billion in, essentially, a single quarter.  Purchases by the rest of Oaktree brought the total invested over &lt;br /&gt;that period to $7.5 billion. &lt;br /&gt;We ran into ver&lt;br /&gt;y few people outside Oaktree who were putting money to work or willing to grant that we &lt;br /&gt;might be doing the right thing.  I told a reporter friend we were buying, and he said –  incredulously – &lt;br /&gt;“You are!?!”   &lt;br /&gt;Around the s&lt;br /&gt;ame time, I met with the CIO of a cl&lt;br /&gt;ient institution as part of our efforts to raise equity to &lt;br /&gt;delever a fund that was perilously close to receiving a margin call, and although I had good responses to &lt;br /&gt;all the increasingly negative scenarios she posited, we never got to a point where she would grant &lt;br /&gt;that “it can’t be that   bad.”  This demonstration of unbridled pessimism –  which appeared to be &lt;br /&gt;widespread at the time –  convinced me that little optimism was embodied in the prices of the assets we &lt;br /&gt;were buying and thus that there was little chance of losing money.  Here’s how I put it in a memo I wrote &lt;br /&gt;that day: &lt;br /&gt;Skepticism and pess&lt;br /&gt;imism aren’t synonymous.  Skepticism calls for pessimism when &lt;br /&gt;optimism is excessive.  But it also calls for optimism when pessimism is excessive. . . . &lt;br /&gt;In the third s   tage    of  a  bear market    . . .   everyone agrees things can   on&lt;br /&gt;ly get w   orse.     The &lt;br /&gt;risk in t  ha t – in terms of opportunity costs, or forgone profits – is eq  ually    clear .   There’s &lt;br /&gt;no d  oubt   in my mind that the b  ear market reached the t  hird stage last w   eek.  That &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t mean i   t can   ’t decline fur&lt;br /&gt;ther,    or   that a bull market’s abou  t to  start.  Bu  t it &lt;br /&gt;does    mean the   negatives are on    the   table, optimism is  thoroughly lacking, and t he &lt;br /&gt;greater long-term risk p   robably lies i  n n ot i  nvesting. &lt;br /&gt;Th e excesses, mistakes and f oo lish  ness    of t  he  2003 -200  7 upward leg of the c ycle w  ere &lt;br /&gt;th e greatest I’ve e   ver w   itnessed.  So   has b   een   the resulting pani   c.  The&lt;br /&gt; d amag  e that’s &lt;br /&gt;been done to security prices may   be enough to correct f&lt;br /&gt;or those excesses – or too &lt;br /&gt;much or too little.  But certainly it’s   a  good time to pick among the rubble.  (The Limits &lt;br /&gt;to Negativism, October 15, 2008) &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, our   confidence in investing the r   eserve fund’s capital was e  nhanced by the f   act t  hat (  a) w  e &lt;br /&gt;were    buying the senior   -most    debt of hi g&lt;br /&gt;h-qu ality    companies that had been the subject of r ecent  buyouts &lt;br /&gt;and (b) w  e w ere b   uyin  g at pr  ices s   o low t   hat   our   debt holdings would do fine even if the   companies ended &lt;br /&gt;up be in g worth only one-quarter or one-third of what the b  uyout funds had just pai  d for   them. &lt;br /&gt;Episodes like   the   visit    with the apprehensive  CIO t   old me t  he p ost -Lehman temperature of the market was &lt;br /&gt;too   low.     There was t  o&lt;br /&gt;o m uch f   ear   and too little greed, too   much pessimism and too little optimism, a  nd &lt;br /&gt;too much   risk a   version an  d t oo   littl  e risk tolerance.  Negative possibilities were being accepted as fact.  &lt;br /&gt;When t h ese things are true, it s  tands to  rea  son t   hat (   a)  investor expectations are   low; (b) as  set &lt;br /&gt;prices probably aren’t excessive; (c)   there’s little possibility of i nvestors     being disappointed; and (d) &lt;br /&gt;thus    there’s l   ittle l   ikelihood of  lasting loss a   nd a    goo  d chance prices will w  ork their way hi  gher.  In &lt;br /&gt;other words, this w   as t  he&lt;br /&gt; epitome of  a bu ying opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;March 2012 &lt;br /&gt;After the   TMT bubble burst i n mid-   2000,    the   S&amp;P 500 dropped in 2000, 200 1, a nd 2 002,  the   first    three   -&lt;br /&gt;year stretch of n egative returns since 1939  .  Thes  e declines caused many investors to lose interest in &lt;br /&gt;equities.    Just a few   years earlier, there had    been wides&lt;br /&gt;pread faith t   hat s   tocks could never perform poorly &lt;br /&gt;for a meaningful period.   Now, all   of a s   udden, such a  time seemed to be a  t  hand.    Stocks delivered &lt;br /&gt;disillusionment, whic h c   an be one    of  the   strongest forces in markets, and investors turned against them.        &lt;br /&gt;During the   first    few    years of the a  ughts, the l  ack of appetite for e  quities   – an d for   bonds, given how low &lt;br /&gt;the   Fed    had driven yields – caused many investors to&lt;br /&gt; concl   ude t   hey couldn’t earn their    targeted returns &lt;br /&gt;through traditional asset c lasses.  This, in t  urn,    caused capital to  flow to  alternative investments, first &lt;br /&gt;h&lt;br /&gt;edge funds and the n private    equity.  Soon investors were c   onfronted by t  he G  lobal Financial Crisis an d &lt;br /&gt;the fe   ar of financial-sector meltdown described above, which added to t  heir    negativity.  These &lt;br /&gt;developments we&lt;br /&gt;    ighed heavil   y on i  n vestor psychology, and a s a r  esult, the S   &amp;P   500 was essentially flat &lt;br /&gt;from 2000 through 2011, returning an average of only 0.55% a  year    for the 12 years. &lt;br /&gt;This    is  how things stood in March 2012, when I wrote the memo Déjà Vu  All Over Again.  My    inspiration &lt;br /&gt;arrived when, sleepless while on a business trip   in Chile, I reached into my Oaktree bag for something to &lt;br /&gt;read a nd c  ame    up w  ith a  n  old a   rticle I had wanted to r  evisit because I was s  ensing    parallels between the &lt;br /&gt;current environment and the one   th e articl   e des&lt;br /&gt;cribed.  It was “  The Death of E quities,” one of t he most &lt;br /&gt;important magazine articles on i  nvesting   of  all t  im e.  It had a   ppeared in Businessweek o  n August 1 3, &lt;br /&gt;1979, following years of r  a&lt;br /&gt;ging inflation, dreary economic news, and p   oor s   tock market p   erformance. &lt;br /&gt;In short, the&lt;br /&gt; a r&lt;br /&gt;ticle’s theme was  that n   o one would ever i  nvest i   n s tocks again because they had d   one s   o &lt;br /&gt;badly for so long.  Here are   a f ew of the a  rticle’s observations: &lt;br /&gt;Whatever cau&lt;br /&gt;sed it, the institutionalization of inflation –  along with structural changes in &lt;br /&gt;communications and psychology –  have killed the U.S. equity market for millions of &lt;br /&gt;investors. . . . &lt;br /&gt;For investors&lt;br /&gt; . . . low stock prices remain a disincentive to buy. . . . &lt;br /&gt;For better or for&lt;br /&gt; worse, then, the U.S. economy probably has to regard the death of &lt;br /&gt;equities as a near-permanent condition –  reversible some day, but not soon. . . . &lt;br /&gt;It would take a su&lt;br /&gt;stained bull market for a couple of years to attract broad-based investor &lt;br /&gt;interest and restore confidence. &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other word&lt;br /&gt;s, poor performance had led to investor disinterest, and disinterest had perpetuated &lt;br /&gt;the poor performance, creating one of the supposedly unstoppable vicious cycles we see in the &lt;br /&gt;markets from time to time.  In the author’s view, this negative state was likely to prevail for years. &lt;br /&gt;Like many ar&lt;br /&gt;guments in the world of investing, the assertions in “The Death of Equities” may have &lt;br /&gt;seemed sensible on the surface.  But if you drilled down a bit –  and, in particular, if you thought like &lt;br /&gt;a contrarian –  the logical flaws became readily apparent.  What if the lows in optimism and &lt;br /&gt;enthusiasm for equities meant things couldn’t get any worse?  Wouldn’t that mean they could only &lt;br /&gt;get better?  And in that case, wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume that low stock prices presaged &lt;br /&gt;future gains, not continued stagnation?   &lt;br /&gt;The above par&lt;br /&gt;agraph captures in brief the difference between the thinking of the average investor and &lt;br /&gt;what I call “second-level thinking.”  The latter doesn’t rely on first impressions; rather, it’s deeper, more &lt;br /&gt;complex, and more nuanced.  In particular, second-level thinkers understand that the convictions of the &lt;br /&gt;masses shape the market, but if those convictions are based on emotion instead of sober analysis, they &lt;br /&gt;should often be bet against, not backed.  Here’s how I put it in Déjà Vu All Over Again: &lt;br /&gt;The  negative fac&lt;br /&gt;tors are clear to the average investor.  And from there he draws negative &lt;br /&gt;conclusions.  But the person who applies logic and insight, rather than superficial views &lt;br /&gt;and emotion, sees something very different. &lt;br /&gt;Thus, it woul&lt;br /&gt;d not have come as a surprise to the more sophisticated investor that “The Death of &lt;br /&gt;Equities” –  perhaps the most sweepingly dour article ever written about the stock market – &lt;br /&gt;preceded one of (if not the) most positive periods in market history.  In the 21 years from 1979 (when &lt;br /&gt;the article was written) through 1999 (just before the TMT bubble burst), the S&amp;P 500’s average annual &lt;br /&gt;return was 17.9%.  That was nearly double its long-term average and enough to turn $1 in 1979 into $32 &lt;br /&gt;in 1999!!  Once more from Déjà Vu All Over Again: &lt;br /&gt;Importantly&lt;br /&gt;, the stage had been set for this rise in 1979 by the accumulation and &lt;br /&gt;excessively pessimistic discounting of negatives. . . .  The extrapolator threw in the &lt;br /&gt;towel on stocks, just as the time was right for the contrarian to turn optimistic.  And &lt;br /&gt;it will always be so. . . . &lt;br /&gt;The great ir&lt;br /&gt;ony here is that the extrapolator actually thinks he’s being respectful of &lt;br /&gt;history: he’s assuming continuation of a trend that has been underway.  But the history &lt;br /&gt;that deserves his attention isn’t the recent rise or fall of an asset’s price, but rather the fact &lt;br /&gt;that most things eventually prove to be cyclical and tend to swing back from the extreme &lt;br /&gt;toward the mean. &lt;br /&gt;Rereading “T&lt;br /&gt;he Death of Equities” in 2012 allowed me to immediately see parallels between the then-&lt;br /&gt;present day and the environment in which that article was written.  Recent events had been highly &lt;br /&gt;negative, performance had been poor, and investor sentiment was depressed.  That was enough to allow &lt;br /&gt;me   –  benefiting from the lessons of history –  to adopt a positive stance: &lt;br /&gt;The story [in&lt;br /&gt; 2012] isn’t as hopeless as it was in 1979, but it is uniformly negative.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;while I don’t expect an equity rally anything like what followed on the heels of “The &lt;br /&gt;Death of Equities,” I don’t find it hard to conjure up positive scenarios. &lt;br /&gt;The result:&lt;br /&gt; From 2012 –  the year of Déjà Vu All Over Again –  through 2021, the S&amp;P 500 returned 16.5% &lt;br /&gt;a year.  Once again, excessively negative sentiment had resulted in major gains.  It’s as simple as that. &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 2020 &lt;br /&gt;The last of th  e f ive &lt;br /&gt;ca&lt;br /&gt;lls   – recent en&lt;br /&gt;ough fo&lt;br /&gt;r&lt;br /&gt; r e&lt;br /&gt;aders to r  ecall    the   context – came i n the e   arl y days of the &lt;br /&gt;Covid-19 pandemic.  The    disease began to enter most people’s    consciousness in F ebruary 2020, an d from &lt;br /&gt;mid-February to mid-March, the S&amp;P 500 fell by approximately one-third.   &lt;br /&gt;In Nobody Knows II (March 2020), my first    memo d&lt;br /&gt;uring the pandemic, I  cited    Harvard epidemiologist &lt;br /&gt;Marc Lipsitch, who s  aid   on   a podcast that   when trying to u nderstand the disease,    ther e wer  e (a)    facts, (b) &lt;br /&gt;informed extrapolations from analogies to other viruses, and (c) o pinion or speculation.  But    it w as c  lear &lt;br /&gt;to m  e a t t he tim e that t   here were no “f  acts” regarding the p  andem ic’s    future course and no “history of &lt;br /&gt;other viruses” of c  omparable magnitude to e  xtrapolate from.     Thus, we w ere   left with “  opinion or &lt;br /&gt;speculation.”   &lt;br /&gt;The bottom&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;line o   f t he a bove   – simply put – is t  hat   we   didn’t know a  nything about what  the   future held. &lt;br /&gt;But whereas some    people think ignorance regarding the f   uture means they mustn’t take    any a   ction, &lt;br /&gt;someone w ho thinks the m  atter through logically and unemotionally should recognize that &lt;br /&gt;ignorance doesn’t mean t   he position they&lt;br /&gt;’r e in  is n  ecessarily the p  osi  tion t   hey    should remain in.  &lt;br /&gt;(This i   s very much along the lines of Oaktree’s post  -Lehman thinking.) &lt;br /&gt;Two    weeks later, on March 19 , 202 0,  I e nded my   client   -only memo Weekly Update in a s  imilar vein: &lt;br /&gt;I’ll sum up m&lt;br /&gt;y views simply –  since there’s nothing sophisticated to say: &lt;br /&gt;•“The bottom” is the day before the recovery begins.  Thus it’s absolutely impossible&lt;br /&gt;to know when the bottom has been reached . . . ever.  Oaktree explicitly rejects the&lt;br /&gt;notion of waiting for the bottom; we buy when we can access value cheap.&lt;br /&gt;•Even though there’s no way to say the bottom is at hand, the conditions that make&lt;br /&gt;bargains available certainly are materializing.&lt;br /&gt;•Given the price drops and selling we’ve seen so far, I believe this is a good time to&lt;br /&gt;invest, although of course it may prove not to have been the best time.&lt;br /&gt;•No one can argue that you should spend all your money today . . . but equally,&lt;br /&gt;no one can argue that you shouldn’t spend any.   (Emphasis added)&lt;br /&gt;Whereas some of the market calls described earlier relied on knowledge of history and/or logical analysis, &lt;br /&gt;this recommendation was based primarily on acknowledgment of ignorance.  All we knew for sure was &lt;br /&gt;that (a) there was a pandemic underway and (b) the U.S. stock market was down one-third.  Doesn’t it &lt;br /&gt;stand to reason, though, that however much money long-term investors had in stocks when the S&amp;P 500 &lt;br /&gt;peaked at 3,386 in February, they should have considered adding to their positions when it hit 2,237 &lt;br /&gt;roughly a month later?  That was the essence of my reasoning.  Here’s how I built up to the conclusion &lt;br /&gt;cited above: &lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to sa&lt;br /&gt;y that something approaching panic is present in the markets.  We’ve seen &lt;br /&gt;record percentage declines several times within the last month (exceeded since 1940 only &lt;br /&gt;by Black Monday –  October 19, 1987 –  when the S&amp;P 500 declined by 20.4% in a day).  &lt;br /&gt;This week and last included down days as follows: -7.6%, -9.5%, -12.0%, and -5.2% &lt;br /&gt;yesterday.  These are enormous losses. . . . &lt;br /&gt;. . . there &lt;br /&gt;has been a rush to cash.  Both long positions and short positions have been &lt;br /&gt;closed out –  a sure sign of chaos and uncertainty.  Cash in money market funds has &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;increased substantially.  This doesn’t tell us anything about fundamentals, but the outlook &lt;br /&gt;for eventual market performance is improved: &lt;br /&gt;•the more pe&lt;br /&gt;ople    have sold,&lt;br /&gt;•the less they have left to sell, and&lt;br /&gt;•the more cash they have with which to buy when they turn less pessimistic. . . .&lt;br /&gt;[In the words of&lt;br /&gt; Justin Quaglia, one of our traders,] after two days of a basically stalled &lt;br /&gt;but stressed [bond] market, we “finally had the rubber band snap.”  Forced sellers &lt;br /&gt;(needing to sell for immediate cash flow needs) brought the market lower in a hurry.  We &lt;br /&gt;opened 3-5 points lower, and the Street was again hesitant to take risk. . . .  &lt;br /&gt;We’re never hap&lt;br /&gt;py to have the events that bring on chaos, and especially not the &lt;br /&gt;ones that are underway today.  But it’s sentiment like Justin describes above that &lt;br /&gt;fuels the emotional selling that allows us to access the greatest bargains.  (Weekly &lt;br /&gt;Update, emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;While neithe&lt;br /&gt;r  a historical foundation nor rigorous quantitative analysis was   achievable, the above &lt;br /&gt;paragraphs indicate that one could still logically determine an appropriate course of action.  As I wrote in &lt;br /&gt;that same memo: &lt;br /&gt;What do we kn&lt;br /&gt;ow?  Not much other than the fact that asset prices are well down, asset &lt;br /&gt;holders’ ability to hold coolly is evaporating, and motivated selling is picking up. &lt;br /&gt;But that was&lt;br /&gt; enough.  Paralysis wasn’t called for, but rather steps that could help us take advantage of &lt;br /&gt;most investors’ panic and the resulting dramatic price declines.  Sometimes it’s as simple as that.  When &lt;br /&gt;the knee-jerk reaction of most investors is to stand pat or sell, a contrarian decision to buy might well be &lt;br /&gt;called for.  Doing so is never easy, though, and mid-March 2020 was one of the most challenging &lt;br /&gt;environments I’ve ever worked through.  But the key, as Rudyard Kipling wrote in the poem “If,” is to &lt;br /&gt;“keep your head when all about you are losing theirs. . .” &lt;br /&gt;How Can You Do I&lt;br /&gt;t?  &lt;br /&gt;I spent the&lt;br /&gt; preceding pages describing these five calls not for purposes of self-congratulation but rather to &lt;br /&gt;lay the groundwork for a discussion of how one can make useful observations regarding the status of the &lt;br /&gt;markets.  Hopefully we learn from our experiences as we go through life.  But to really learn from &lt;br /&gt;them, we have to step back on occasion, look at an entire string of events, and figure out the &lt;br /&gt;following: (a) what happened, (b) is there a pattern that has repeated, and (c) what are the lessons &lt;br /&gt;to be learned from the pattern? &lt;br /&gt;Once in a wh&lt;br /&gt;ile –    once or twice a decade, perhaps –  markets go so high or so low that the argument for &lt;br /&gt;action is compelling and the probability of being right is high.  As my son helped me to recognize, I had &lt;br /&gt;identified five of those, and they paid off.  But what if I’d tried to make 50 market calls in my 50 years     &lt;br /&gt;. . . or 500?  By definition, I would have been making judgments about markets that were closer to the &lt;br /&gt;middle ground –  perhaps a little high or a little low, but not so extreme as to permit dependable &lt;br /&gt;conclusions.  Investors’ records of success with calls in markets like these are poor, since even if they’re &lt;br /&gt;right about asset prices being out of line, it’s very easy for something that’s a little overpriced to go on to &lt;br /&gt;become demonstrably more so, and then to turn into a raging bubble, and vice versa.  In fact, if we could &lt;br /&gt;rely on small mispricings to always correct promptly, they would never grow into the manias, bubbles, &lt;br /&gt;and crashes we see from time to time.   &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,   one k   ey is to a void making macro call s&lt;br /&gt; to o often.  I w ouldn’t want   to t  ry to m  a    ke a livin  g predicting &lt;br /&gt;the outcome of coi n tosses or figuring out whether the   favorite    will    cover the p  oint s   pread in every &lt;br /&gt;football  game over t   he c  ourse of a season.  You have t  o pick your  spots – as W  arren Buffett p  uts i  t, wait &lt;br /&gt;for   a  fat   pitch.  Most of the t  ime,    you have nothing   to lose by abstaining from trying to adroitly get in and &lt;br /&gt;out   of  the   markets: you merely participate in&lt;br /&gt; their long-term tre nds,    and those have be en   very    favorable. &lt;br /&gt;My readers know I don’t t   hin k consistently profitable market calls   ca n be m  anufactured out   of &lt;br /&gt;macroeconomic forecasts.  Nor    do I believe you   can   beat the market simply by analyzing company &lt;br /&gt;reports.  On  both subjects, as Andrew puts it (see my memo Something of Value, January 2021), “readily &lt;br /&gt;avail&lt;br /&gt;able quantitative data regarding the past a  nd present” can’t hold the secret    to superior performance &lt;br /&gt;since it’s a  vailable to everyone. &lt;br /&gt;When   mark&lt;br /&gt;ets a  re a  t e xtreme highs o r lows, the essential requirement for a   chieving a superior view &lt;br /&gt;of t  heir future performance lies i  n understanding what’s responsible for t   he   current conditions.  &lt;br /&gt;Eve ryone can study economics, finance, and accounting and learn how the m  arkets are  supposed to work.  &lt;br /&gt;But    superior in&lt;br /&gt;vestment results come   from    exploiting the differences    between how things are   supposed to &lt;br /&gt;work and how they actually do work in the real    world.  To do  that, the e  ssential inputs a   ren’t economic &lt;br /&gt;data   or f  inancial statement analysis.  The key lies in understanding prevailing investor psychology. &lt;br /&gt;For   me, t   h&lt;br /&gt;e t hings one m ust d o fall   under the   general heading of “taking the temperature of the   market.”  &lt;br /&gt;I’ll i   temize the most essential components here: &lt;br /&gt;•Engage in patte&lt;br /&gt;rn recognition.   Study market history in order to better understand the&lt;br /&gt;implications of today’s events.  Ironically, when viewed over the long term, investor psychology&lt;br /&gt;and thus market cycles –  which seem flighty and unpredictable –  fluctuate in ways that approach&lt;br /&gt;dependability (if you’re willing to overlook their highly variable causality, timing, and&lt;br /&gt;amplitude).&lt;br /&gt;•Understand that cycles stem from what I call “excesses and corrections” and that a strong&lt;br /&gt;movement in one direction is more likely to be followed –  sooner or later –  by a correction in the&lt;br /&gt;opposite direction than by a trend that “grows to the sky.”&lt;br /&gt;•Watch for moments when most people are so optimistic that they think things can only get&lt;br /&gt;better, an expression that usually serves to justify the dangerous view that “there’s no price too&lt;br /&gt;high.”  Likewise, recognize when people are so depressed that they conclude things can only get&lt;br /&gt;worse, as this often means they think a sale at any price is a good sale.  When the herd’s thinking&lt;br /&gt;is either Pollyannaish or apocalyptic, the odds increase that the current price level and direction&lt;br /&gt;are unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;•Remember that in extreme times, because of the above, the secret to making money lies in&lt;br /&gt;contrarianism, not conformity.   When emotional investors take an extreme view of an asset’s&lt;br /&gt;future and, as a result, take the price to unjustified levels, the “easy money” is usually made by&lt;br /&gt;doing the opposite.  This is, however, very different from simply diverging from the&lt;br /&gt;consensus all the time.   Indeed, most of the time, the consensus is as close to right as most&lt;br /&gt;individuals can get.  So to be successful at contrarianism, you have to understand (a) what the&lt;br /&gt;herd is doing, (b) why it’s doing it, (c) what’s wrong with it, and (d) what should be done instead&lt;br /&gt;and why.&lt;br /&gt;•Bear in mind that much of what happens in economies and markets doesn’t result from a&lt;br /&gt;mechanical process, but from the to and fro of investors’ emotions.   Take note of the swings&lt;br /&gt;and capitalize whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;•Resist your own emotionality.   Stand apart from the crowd and its psychology; don’t join in!&lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Be on the lookout for illogical propositions (such as “stocks have fallen so far that no one will&lt;br /&gt;be interested in them”).  When you come across a widely accepted proposition that doesn’t make&lt;br /&gt;sense or one you find too good to be true (or too bad to be true), take appropriate action.  See&lt;br /&gt;something; do something.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, there’s a lot t  o grapple with w  hen t   aking the temperature of t  he&lt;br /&gt; market.  In m  y  opinion, &lt;br /&gt;it h  as m ore t  o d o w ith clear-eyed observations an  d as sessments of  the   implications of what you see &lt;br /&gt;than w  ith c omputers, financial data,    or c  alculations. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll go   into    additional depth on a couple of points: &lt;br /&gt;On   pattern recognition:  You may have notice   d that t   he f irst   of t  he f ive c   alls   described above was m  ade &lt;br /&gt;in 2000, when I had already been working in     the   investment industry for more tha n 30 years.  Does this &lt;br /&gt;mean there    were    no h  ighs and   l&lt;br /&gt;ows t   o  remark on  in t  hose earlier years?  No  , I t  hink i   t m eans    it  took    me &lt;br /&gt;that long to gain the i   nsight and experience needed to detect the m  arket’s excesses. &lt;br /&gt;Most not  ably, whereas I spent two pages above describing the profound error in “The Death of E  quities,” &lt;br /&gt;you    may have noticed that I di dn’t    say a  nything about my havin g called out t he a rticle when it a ppeared &lt;br /&gt;in&lt;br /&gt; Businessweek in 1979.     The reaso  n is s  i   mple: I didn’t.  I  had onl y been in this b  u   siness for  about a &lt;br /&gt;decade at t hat   point, so (a) I   didn’t have th e experience needed to r  ecognize the ar   ticle’s error and ( b) I &lt;br /&gt;had yet to develop the   unemotional stance and   contrarian approach needed to depart from    the herd and &lt;br /&gt;rebel against its  thesis.  The best I can s  ay   is th  at  my e   ventual development of those a   ttributes &lt;br /&gt;enab&lt;br /&gt;led me t o c atch the same erro r w hen it arose again 33 years later.  Pattern recognition i   s an &lt;br /&gt;important part   of w  hat w   e  do,   but i   t s eems t   o require time    in t  he f  iel d – and    some scars – rather than just &lt;br /&gt;bo&lt;br /&gt;ok l earning. &lt;br /&gt;On c   ycles: I n m y  book Mastering the Market Cycle, I defined cycles not a   s  a  series of up and do wn &lt;br /&gt;movements, eac h of w  hich regularly precedes the n   ext   – which I believe is t he us  u    al definition – but as a &lt;br /&gt;series of events, each of  which causes the   next.     This c ausality holds the ke  y to understanding cycles.  In &lt;br /&gt;particular, I t h&lt;br /&gt;ink economies, inv estor    psychology, and thus markets e  ventually go too f   ar i  n one direction &lt;br /&gt;or a nother – they    become too positive or too negative – and afterward they eventually swing back toward &lt;br /&gt;moderatio n (and then usually toward excess in the oppos ite d  irection).  Thus, in m y opinion, these &lt;br /&gt;cycles are best understood as s  temming from “excesses and c  orrections.”  Overlooking the d etails of &lt;br /&gt;the i   n&lt;br /&gt;dividual episodes, it’s c  lear    from the de  scriptions of t  hese  five calls that t   he greatest opportunities &lt;br /&gt;for  bargain purchases result from overly negative prevailing psychology and t   he g  reatest opportunities to &lt;br /&gt;sell   at t  oo -high prices    aris  e from ex  cessive optimism. &lt;br /&gt;Macro Calls and t he Oaktree Culture &lt;br /&gt;While on the subject of  market calls, I want to touch on two questions I’ve received repeatedly since &lt;br /&gt;the publication of my memo The Illusion of Knowledge (September 2022), which discussed why I &lt;br /&gt;believe creating helpful macro forecasts is so challenging.  How does    making these market calls fit &lt;br /&gt;within Oaktree’s investment approach?  And     how can we   make “micro forecasts” concerning &lt;br /&gt;companies, industries, and securities without predicting the macro context?   &lt;br /&gt;In 1995, w&lt;br /&gt;hen m y four Oaktree co-  founders and I    decided to form a new f   irm, w e’d already been working &lt;br /&gt;together for ni  ne   years on average.  To come up with an investment philosophy that would guide the new &lt;br /&gt;entity, we onl  y had to r  eflect on what had worked for us up t  o tha t  point and what we believed in.  This &lt;br /&gt;led us to write down the   six tenets that describe how we i  nvest, and we haven’t changed a  word in 28 &lt;br /&gt;years. &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the six tenets, two raise questions regarding how macro calls fit within Oaktree’s investment approach: &lt;br /&gt;•Number five: “We don’t base our investment decisions on macro forecasts.”&lt;br /&gt;•Number six: “We’re not market timers.”&lt;br /&gt;How about the fi&lt;br /&gt;rst of those?  It’s easy to say you don’t invest on the basis of macro forecasts, and I’ve &lt;br /&gt;been saying this for decades.  But the truth is, if you’re a bottom-up investor, you make estimates &lt;br /&gt;regarding future earnings and/or asset values, and those estimates have to be predicated on &lt;br /&gt;assumptions regarding the macro environment.   Certainly, you can’t predict a business’s results in a &lt;br /&gt;given period without considering what’ll be going on in the economy at that point.  So, then, what does &lt;br /&gt;avoiding macro forecasting mean to us?  My answer is as follows: &lt;br /&gt;•We generally ass&lt;br /&gt;ume the macro environment of the future will resemble past norms.&lt;br /&gt;•We then make allowance for the possibility that things will be worse than normal.  Ensuring our&lt;br /&gt;investments have a generous “margin of safety” makes it more likely they’ll do okay even if&lt;br /&gt;future macro developments disappoint somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;•What we never do is project that the macro environment will be distinctly better than&lt;br /&gt;normal in some way, making winners out of particular investments.  Doing so can lead to profits&lt;br /&gt;if one is right, but it’s hard to consistently make such forecasts correctly.  Further, investments&lt;br /&gt;reliant on favorable macro developments can expose investors to the possibility of&lt;br /&gt;disappointment, leading to loss.  It’s our goal to construct portfolios where the surprises will&lt;br /&gt;be on the upside.  Relying on optimistic underlying assumptions is rarely part of such a&lt;br /&gt;process.  We prefer to make assumptions I would describe as “neutral.”&lt;br /&gt;So we   do base    our modeling on mac r&lt;br /&gt;o assumptions – by n  ecessity – but r   arel y are t   hose &lt;br /&gt;assumptions boldl   y idiosyncratic or optimistic.  We n   ever ba se ou  r i nvestment decisions on the &lt;br /&gt;mistaken belief that w   e ( or a  nyone else) c   an p  redict the f   uture.  Thus, we r ecognize t   hat t   he a  bove    average &lt;br /&gt;results   we seek must ar  ise f  rom&lt;br /&gt; our ground-up  insights and not f   rom our  ability to do a superior job of &lt;br /&gt;forecasting unusual macro events. &lt;br /&gt;You might ask here, “What about the memo Sea Change and its assertion that we may be seeing a shift &lt;br /&gt;toward a w   holl y different environment?”  My   answer is t hat I f   eel   good about this    memo because (a)  it’s &lt;br /&gt;mostl   y a r eview of r  ec&lt;br /&gt;ent   history and (   b)  the   important observations surround the u  nusual nature of the &lt;br /&gt;20 09-21 period, its e ffect on investment outcomes, and t   he i mprobability of it r epeating.   (I’m particularly &lt;br /&gt;comfortable sa   ying interest rates a   ren’t going to  decline by a  nother 2,000 basis points f   rom here.)    While &lt;br /&gt;it’s i   mportant to s  tick t   o  guiding principles, it’s a  lso e  ssential to r ecognize and r  espond to r eal c hange &lt;br /&gt;whe n it h appens.  Thus, I stan d by Sea Change (m y only expression of a  n o pinion of this kind i n my &lt;br /&gt;entire working life) as an  acceptable deviation from    my s   tandard practice.  For me, the case f   or  a sea &lt;br /&gt;change h as m ore t   o do   wit  h observing and inferring than it does with predicting. &lt;br /&gt;And what a bo&lt;br /&gt;ut m  arket ti&lt;br /&gt;ming?  As I   ’ve w   ritten numerous times since developing my r   isk -posture &lt;br /&gt;framework  a few years ago , every investor should operate most of t  he time in t  he c  on text o   f  their normal &lt;br /&gt;risk p osture, by which I mean the   balance between aggressiveness and defensiveness that’s right for  them.  &lt;br /&gt;It m  akes    perfect sense to&lt;br /&gt; try t  o var  y that    balance when circumstances dictate compellingly that y   ou should &lt;br /&gt;do s o an d your judgments  have a high probability of b  ein g correct,    like i   n the case of the   five    calls    I’ve &lt;br /&gt;discussed   .  But    such    occasions are rar&lt;br /&gt;e.     &lt;br /&gt;So, we stay i  n  our normal bal&lt;br /&gt;anc  e – whic   h in Oaktree’s case i   mplies a bias t  oward defensiveness – &lt;br /&gt;unless compelled to do other  wise.  But we are willing to m ake&lt;br /&gt; c hanges in  our  balan  ce between &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aggressiveness and defensiveness, and we have done so successfully in the past.  In fact, I consider one of &lt;br /&gt;my principal responsibilities to be thinking about the proper balance for Oaktree at any given time. &lt;br /&gt;If we’re ha&lt;br /&gt;ppy to vary our risk posture, then what does it mean when we say, “we’re not market timers”?  &lt;br /&gt;For me, it means the following: &lt;br /&gt;•We don’t sell&lt;br /&gt; things we consider attractive long-term holdings to raise cash in expectation&lt;br /&gt;of a market decline.  We usually sell because (a) a holding has reached our target price, (b) the&lt;br /&gt;investment case has deteriorated, or (c) we’ve found something better.  Our open-end portfolios&lt;br /&gt;are almost always fully invested; that way we avoid the risk of missing out on positive returns.  It&lt;br /&gt;also means buying usually necessitates some selling.&lt;br /&gt;•We don’t say, “It’s cheap today, but it’ll be cheaper in six months, so we’ll wait.”   If it’s&lt;br /&gt;cheap, we buy.  If it gets cheaper and we conclude the thesis is still intact, we buy more.  We’re&lt;br /&gt;much more afraid of missing a bargain-priced opportunity than we are of starting to buy a good&lt;br /&gt;thing too early.  No one really knows whether something will get cheaper in the days and weeks&lt;br /&gt;ahead –  that’s a matter of predicting investor psychology, which is somewhere between&lt;br /&gt;challenging and impossible.  We feel we’re much more likely to correctly gauge the value of&lt;br /&gt;individual assets.&lt;br /&gt;While on the s&lt;br /&gt;ubject of buying too soon, I want to spend a minute on an interesting question: Which is &lt;br /&gt;worse, buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  For me the answer is easy: the latter.  If you buy at &lt;br /&gt;what later turns out to have been a market top, you’ll suffer a downward fluctuation.  But that isn’t cause &lt;br /&gt;for concern if the long-term thesis remains intact.  And, anyway, the next top is usually higher than the &lt;br /&gt;last top, meaning you’re likely to be ahead eventually.  But if you sell at a market bottom, you render that &lt;br /&gt;downward fluctuation permanent,  and, even more importantly, you get off the escalator of a rising &lt;br /&gt;economy and rising markets that has made so many long-term investors rich.  This is why I describe &lt;br /&gt;selling at the bottom as the cardinal sin in investing. &lt;br /&gt;*  *        *&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about&lt;br /&gt; the macro environment and how it influences our proper risk posture falls squarely &lt;br /&gt;within our responsibilities as investment managers.  But the bottom line is that, at Oaktree, we &lt;br /&gt;approach these things with great humility, diverging from our neutral assumptions and normal &lt;br /&gt;behavior only when circumstances leave us no other choice.  “Five times in 50 years” gives you an &lt;br /&gt;idea about our level of interest in being market timers.  The fact is, we do so hesitantly. &lt;br /&gt;Jul  y 10,    2023 &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   Fewer Losers, or&lt;br /&gt; More Winners? &lt;br /&gt;My   memos got t heir    start i   n October 1990,   &lt;br /&gt;inspired by an interesting juxtaposition between two events.  &lt;br /&gt;One was  a  dinner in Minneapolis with D avid VanBenschoten, who  was t   he  head    of  the   General Mills &lt;br /&gt;pension fund.  Dave told me that, in his 14 years i   n the   job, t   he  fund’s equity return had never ranked &lt;br /&gt;above the 27&lt;br /&gt;th&lt;br /&gt; percentile of the pe  n&lt;br /&gt;sio n fun d universe or be  low t   he 47&lt;br /&gt;th&lt;br /&gt; percentile.  An d where did those &lt;br /&gt;solidly second-quartile annual returns place t   he f  und f or t  he   14 years overall?  Fourth percentile!  I w as &lt;br /&gt;wowed.  It t  urns    out   that most i  nvestors aiming for top-  decil e performance eventually shoot themselves in &lt;br /&gt;the f   oot, but Dave   never did. &lt;br /&gt;Around the same time, a prominent value investing firm    reported terrible results, causing its p  resident    to &lt;br /&gt;issue     an e  asy r   ationalization: “If yo u want to be i  n the t   op 5% of mone  y managers, you have to be   willing &lt;br /&gt;to be    in the bottom 5%, too  .&lt;br /&gt;   ”  My r   eaction was  immediate: “M y clients don’t care   whether I’m   in t he t  op &lt;br /&gt;5% in an  y s ingle year,  and they (and I) have absolutely no interest in me e   ver   being in the bottom 5%.”    &lt;br /&gt;These two events had  a  strong influence on me   and helped define my  – and w  hat f ive y   ears    later became &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree’s – investment philosophy, which emphasizes risk control and consistency above all.  Here’s how &lt;br /&gt;I put it&lt;br /&gt; 33 years ago in that first memo, titled The Route to Performance: &lt;br /&gt;I feel strongly that attempting to achieve a superior long-term record by stringing &lt;br /&gt;together a run of top-decile years is unlikely to succeed.  Rather, striving to do a little &lt;br /&gt;better than average every year –  and    through discipline to have highly superior relative &lt;br /&gt;results in bad times –  is : &lt;br /&gt;•less likely to produce extreme volatility,&lt;br /&gt;•less likely to produce huge losses which can’t be recouped and, most&lt;br /&gt;importantly,&lt;br /&gt;•more likely to work (given the fact that all of us are only human).&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, what [G&lt;br /&gt;eneral Mills’s] record tells me is that, in equities, if you can avoid &lt;br /&gt;losers (and losing years), the winners will take care of themselves.  I believe most &lt;br /&gt;strongly that this holds true in my group’s opportunistic niches as well –  that   the best &lt;br /&gt;foundation for above-avera   ge long-term performance is an absence of disasters.   &lt;br /&gt;As you can see, my dinner with Dave was a seminal event; his approach was clearly the one for me.  &lt;br /&gt;(Incidentally, I want to share that after decades of not having been in touch, Dave was among the many &lt;br /&gt;kind people who wrote in recent months to encourage me vis-à- vis my health issue.  This is a great &lt;br /&gt;example of the many personal dividends my career has paid.) &lt;br /&gt;Putting It in Brief &lt;br /&gt;That first memo, and the bit cited above, include a phrase you’ve   likely heard  from    Oaktree: If we avoid &lt;br /&gt;the losers, the winners will    take care of themselves.   My partners and I considered this phrase so fitting &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that we adopted it as our motto when Oaktree was formed in 1995.  Our reasoning was simple: If we &lt;br /&gt;invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds and are able to avoid the ones that default, some of the non-&lt;br /&gt;defaulters we buy will benefit from positive events, s uch as upgrades and takeovers.  That is, the winners &lt;br /&gt;will materialize without our having explicitly sought them out  .  &lt;br /&gt;We   thought that phrase was innovative.  B ut in 2005, while working with Seth Klarman to update the &lt;br /&gt;1940     edition of Benjamin Graham and Dav  id Dodd’s Security Analysis –  the “bible of value investing” – &lt;br /&gt;I read something that indicated we were    late by about 50 years.   In the section Seth asked me to edit, I &lt;br /&gt;came across Graham and Dodd’s description of “fixed-value   ” (or fixed-income) investing as “a negative &lt;br /&gt;art.”    What did they mean?   &lt;br /&gt;At first, I found their    observation cynical, but then I realized what they were saying.  Let’s assume there &lt;br /&gt;are  one hundred 8% bonds outstanding.  Let’s further assume that ninety will pay interest and principal as &lt;br /&gt;promised and ten  will default.  Since they’re all 8% bonds, all the ones    that pay will deliver the same 8% &lt;br /&gt;return –  it doesn’t matter which ones you bought.  The only thing that matters is whether you bought any &lt;br /&gt;of the ten  that defaulted.  In other words, bond investors improve their performance not through what they &lt;br /&gt;buy, but through what they exclude –  not by finding winners, but by avoiding losers.  There it is: a &lt;br /&gt;negative art.  &lt;br /&gt;One more anecdote concerning the origin of the phrase: I’ve always been interested in old books.  A few &lt;br /&gt;years ago, while walking through a Las Vegas convention center on the way to meet with a client, I came &lt;br /&gt;upon a rare book fair.  I stopped at the booth of a book   dealer I know, and my eye immediately fell on a &lt;br /&gt;book he had for sale: How to Trade in Stocks, by Jesse Livermore.  Here’s the quote the dealer had &lt;br /&gt;highlighted: “Winners take care of themselves; losers never do.”  You may be tempted to believe &lt;br /&gt;Live   rmore borrowed my idea . . . until you realize that, like Graham and Dodd, he published these lines in &lt;br /&gt;1940.  So much for my innovation.  &lt;br /&gt;At the time I adopted that saying, my partners and I were primarily high yield bond investors.  And since &lt;br /&gt;non -convertible bonds have little   upside potential beyond their promised yield to maturity, it truly was the &lt;br /&gt;case that our main job was to avoid the non-payers, with the assumption that some subset of the payers &lt;br /&gt;would likely give us exposure to positive developments that occurred.   It was an appropriate way to sum &lt;br /&gt;up our approach as bond investors.   &lt;br /&gt;But  fortunately, I joined up with Bruce Karsh in 1987, and in 1988 we organized our first distressed debt &lt;br /&gt;fund.  Now we were investing in bonds that had defaulted or seemed likely to do so.  We thought we &lt;br /&gt;might be able to buy them at bargain prices because of the cloud they were under, giving us the possibility &lt;br /&gt;of  capital appreciation.  Bruce has since become well known for his investing acumen, and,  certainly,  his &lt;br /&gt;returns since 1988 can’t be attributed to the mere avoidance of losses.  When you aspire to returns well &lt;br /&gt;above those available on bonds, it’s not enough to avoid losers; you actually have to find (or create) &lt;br /&gt;winners from time to time.  The returns generated by Bruce and his group show that they’ve done so. &lt;br /&gt;Oaktree now has a number of what I call “aspirational strategies,”  meaning they need winners.  So why &lt;br /&gt;do we still use   the above phrase as our motto, and why is “the primacy of risk control” still    the first &lt;br /&gt;tenet of our investment philosophy?  The answer is we want the concept of risk control to always be top &lt;br /&gt;of  mind for  our investment professionals.  W hen they review a security, we want them to ask not   only &lt;br /&gt;“H ow much money can I make if things go well?” but also “What will happen if events don’t go as &lt;br /&gt;planned?  How much could I lose if things get bad?  And how bad would things have to get?”  &lt;br /&gt;Risk control is still number one at Oaktree.   Seventy-plus years ago, UCLA football coach Henry &lt;br /&gt;Russell “Red” Sanders said, “Winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.”  (The saying is also attributed &lt;br /&gt;to Vince Lombardi, legendary football coach of the Green Bay Packers.)  While I haven’t fig ured out &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.2All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exactly what that phrase means, I’m firmly convinced that for   Oaktree, risk control isn’t everything; it &lt;br /&gt;is the only thing.  &lt;br /&gt;Not Risk Avoid&lt;br /&gt;ance   &lt;br /&gt;Understanding the distinction between risk control and risk avoidance is truly essential for &lt;br /&gt;investors.   Risk avoidance basically consists of not doing anything where the outcome is uncertain and &lt;br /&gt;could be negative.  And yet, at its heart, investing consists of bearing uncertainty in the pursuit of &lt;br /&gt;attractive returns.  For this reason, risk avoidance usually equates to return avoidance.  You can avoid risk &lt;br /&gt;by buying Treasury bills or putting your money into government-insured deposits, but there’s a reason &lt;br /&gt;why the returns on these are generally the lowest available in the investment world.  Why should you be &lt;br /&gt;well paid for parting with your money for a while if you’re sure to get it back? &lt;br /&gt;Risk control, on the other hand, consists of declining to take risks that (a) exceed the quantum of &lt;br /&gt;risk you want to live with and/or (b) you wouldn’t be   well rewarded for bearing.   I’ve written in the &lt;br /&gt;past about what I call “the intelligent bearing of risk for profit.”  Here’s the backstory: &lt;br /&gt;I got my start managing money in 1978, when Citi asked me to run portfolios of convertibles  and high &lt;br /&gt;yield bonds.  The former were mostly non-investment grade securities issued by companies that had no &lt;br /&gt;alternative when seeking to raise capital, and the latter were, according to the terminology of the day, &lt;br /&gt;low -rated “junk bonds.”  Clearly, they both entailed significant credit risk.  Around 1980, a reporter from &lt;br /&gt;one of the first financial news networks asked me a provocative question: “How can you buy high yield &lt;br /&gt;bonds when you know some of the issuers are going to default?”  My response captured the essence of &lt;br /&gt;intelligent risk bearing: “How can life insurance companies insure people’s lives when they know they’re &lt;br /&gt;all going to die?”   &lt;br /&gt;The point is simple: These functions can both be performed in an intelligent, risk-controlled way.  For &lt;br /&gt;that to be the case, the risk has to be: &lt;br /&gt;•risk you’re aware of,&lt;br /&gt;•risk you can analyze,&lt;br /&gt;•risk you can diversify, and&lt;br /&gt;•risk you’re well paid to assume.&lt;br /&gt;Risks like this needn’t be avoided.  If you have real insight, such risks can be borne prudently and &lt;br /&gt;profitably. &lt;br /&gt;I know several investors who take much more risk than Oaktree does and whose bad years are much &lt;br /&gt;worse than ours.  But the few who possess genuine skill –  what I call “alpha”  (more on that later)  – &lt;br /&gt;produce jumbo returns in their good years, such that their long-term returns are exceptional.  Their clients &lt;br /&gt;are well rewarded . . . assuming they have enough intestinal fortitude to hang in through the bad years.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus, risk-taking isn’t unwise per se, and risk avoidance is appropriate only for investors who feel they &lt;br /&gt;can’t survive tough times. &lt;br /&gt;Building a Goo&lt;br /&gt;d Record &lt;br /&gt;Since (a) all but the most cautious investing entails risk and (b) the presence of risk means results will be &lt;br /&gt;unpredictable and inconsistent, very few (if any) investors are able to have only good years or to assemble &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.3All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;portfolios that   contain only winners.  The questio   n isn’t whether you’re goin g to  have losers, but &lt;br /&gt;rather how   many and h ow b  ad r  e   lative to your winners. &lt;br /&gt;Warren Buffett – arguably the investor with the best l  ong-  term    recor   d (an d certainly the l ongest l   ong-term &lt;br /&gt;record) – is  widely described as  having had on  ly  twelve great winners   in h  is  career.  His partner Charlie &lt;br /&gt;Munger told me t   he v  ast m  ajority of his   own wealth came&lt;br /&gt; not f   rom  twelve winners, but  only four.  I &lt;br /&gt;believe the ingredients of   Warren’s and   Charlie’s great p  erformance are   simple: (a) a    lot o  f  investments in &lt;br /&gt;which they did decently, (b) a relatively small number of b  ig w  inners that    they    invested in heavily an&lt;br /&gt;d &lt;br /&gt;held    for d  ecades, and (   c) r elatively few big losers.  N o one s   houl  d expect to have    – or e xpect their m  oney &lt;br /&gt;managers to&lt;br /&gt; have – all bi  g winners and no losers. &lt;br /&gt;In fact,  not   havin   g any l   osers isn’t a useful   goal.     The only   sure    way    to a  chieve    that    is b  y not taking   any &lt;br /&gt;risk.     But, as I s  ai d earlier, ri&lt;br /&gt;sk avoidance is l ikely to result in return avoidance.  There’s such a thing   as &lt;br /&gt;the r   isk   of t  aking too l  ittle r  isk.  Most people understand this    intellectually, but h   uman nature   makes &lt;br /&gt;it h ard    for many t   o accept the i  dea    tha  t the   willingness to  live    with    some losses i s a n e ssential &lt;br /&gt;ingredient in i nvestment success. &lt;br /&gt;Having watched some great tennis this summer – right    through the&lt;br /&gt; U.S. Open this    past weekend – I’ll &lt;br /&gt;recycle a tennis analogy I first suggested in my memo Dare to Be Great II (April 2014).  What if I went &lt;br /&gt;out t   o p la y tennis and said,    “Today, I’m not  going to commit any service faults”?  My serves woul  d have &lt;br /&gt;to be s o meek that my opponent would    likel   y destroy them.  Tennis players have to tak e some risk   if &lt;br /&gt;they hope t  o&lt;br /&gt; succeed (see below).  If n  one    of  your serves fall   outside the  servi   ce box, you’re pr  obably &lt;br /&gt;serving too cautiously to win.    The s   ame i   s t rue o   f i nvest   ing .   As   my long-time partner Sheld   on Stone puts &lt;br /&gt;it, “  If you don’t experience any defaults, you’re probably not taking enough credit risk.”   &lt;br /&gt;Winners’ S  tats &lt;br /&gt;Looking back, it  turns out I   devoted an e  ntire    memo to analogies betwe&lt;br /&gt;en investing and sports once per &lt;br /&gt;decade i  n the   1990s, the   2000s, and the 2010s.  This    time, in my fourth decade of memo-writing, I’m &lt;br /&gt;going to devote a few more paragraphs to  tennis. &lt;br /&gt;As m  entioned above, tennis makes for &lt;br /&gt;very    apt   comparisons to investing.  Hit s   afely and   get   blasted?  Or &lt;br /&gt;try for shots y  ou can’t make c   onsistently an d beat    yourself?  Charl   es &lt;br /&gt;D. Ellis’s article “The Loser’s &lt;br /&gt;Game” (The Financial Analysts Journal,  July/August 1975) was t  ruly s   eminal in my   development as an &lt;br /&gt;investor.   He p  ointed out that t   here are t  wo kin&lt;br /&gt;ds of    tennis players . .  .  actually, two    different types of &lt;br /&gt;tennis  games.  Professionals play    a winner’s game: They win by hitting winners (in t  ennis   , that means &lt;br /&gt;shots t he opponent   can’ t return).  Since their    game is s o m uch within their c  ontrol, the y ca n usually &lt;br /&gt;p&lt;br /&gt;roduce the s  hots t   hey want, the b est   of w  hich win points.  But a   mateur tennis is a l  oser’s    game: The &lt;br /&gt;winner is us ually the p  erson who h  its t  he fewest losers .   If  you can just keep    the b   al l in p  lay long &lt;br /&gt;enough, eventually your opponent will    hit   it of f t he   court or  into the net.  The    amateur doesn’t have t  o hit &lt;br /&gt;winners t  o win, an d that’s a good thing, because he  or s he g  enerally is  inca  pable of do  ing so dependably. &lt;br /&gt;A qu  ick look at some statistics from    this    year’s Wimbledon provides a  great     deal    of f  o&lt;br /&gt;od for thought.  I’ll &lt;br /&gt;look    first at  the   men’s quarterfinal match between Daniil Medvedev, the #3    seed in the t   ournament, and &lt;br /&gt;un seeded Christopher Eubanks.  Eubanks, 6’7”    and highly athletic, surprised everyone with his rush to &lt;br /&gt;the quarterfinals.  But, i   n Medvedev, he   was playing someone who’s spent years t  railing just behind the &lt;br /&gt;“big t   hree” of  men’s tennis: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal,    and Roger Federer.   &lt;br /&gt;As   a pr onounced underdog, Eubanks probably recognized that he    wasn’t likely to ou   tlast or out-steady &lt;br /&gt;Medvedev.  Thus, he had to go for winners.  If   that    was    Eubanks’s plan, he succeeded in e  xecuting it.   He &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.4All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;achieved 74 winners to Medvedev’s 52 , and he aggressively rushed the net 67 times (for 44 winners) &lt;br /&gt;compared to Medvedev’s 8  (for    4  winners).  These are great offensive stats. &lt;br /&gt;The problem is that –  as I’ve experienced firsthand many times – if you’re up against a player who’s &lt;br /&gt;better than you are, you have to attempt shots that aren’t firmly within your competence in order to have a &lt;br /&gt;hope of winning.  Thus, along with his 74 winners, Eubanks was guilty of 55 unforced errors (mistakes &lt;br /&gt;that aren’t forced by good shots from one’s opponent; the easy way to make an unforced error is to go for &lt;br /&gt;a winner and miss).  In comparison, Medvedev committed only 13 unforced errors. &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Eubanks had considerably more winners than Medvedev, but he had three unforced errors &lt;br /&gt;for every four winners, whereas Medvedev had only one per four.  Medvedev won 53% of the points &lt;br /&gt;played versus Eubanks’s 47%, and thus he won the match.  The lesson is that it’s not enough to have &lt;br /&gt;more   winners.  To win –  in tennis as in investing –  you have to have a favorable relationship between &lt;br /&gt;winners and losers.  You can win by having a few winners but fewer losers or by having a lot of &lt;br /&gt;losers but more winners.  Neither maximizing winners nor minimizing losers is necessarily enough.  &lt;br /&gt;It’s all in the balance.   &lt;br /&gt;And that leads me to the Wimbledon men’s final.  This exciting match pitted Djokovic, who had won   the &lt;br /&gt;most Grand Slam championships in history (23 combined at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French &lt;br /&gt;Open, and the Australian Open), against up-and  -coming 20-year  -old Carlos Alcaraz, who had a grand &lt;br /&gt;total of one.  Like Eubanks, Alcaraz plays a big, athletic game and goes for a lot of winners.  You can see &lt;br /&gt;that in his serving: Alcaraz had seven double faults, more than twice Djokovic’s three.  But, again, a &lt;br /&gt;single statistic tells us very little, since Alcaraz’s attempts at big serves gave him nine aces (serves his &lt;br /&gt;opponent couldn’t even get his racquet on), more than four times Djokovic’s two.  This is an indication of &lt;br /&gt;the players’ respective styles.  In the end, Alcaraz won the match with 66 winners, whereas Djokovic had &lt;br /&gt;only 32.   &lt;br /&gt;So, Alcaraz beat Djokovic with a “bigger,” high-risk game, while Medvedev beat Eubanks with his &lt;br /&gt;steadier, risk-controlled style.  Neither approach is better than the other per se.  Style alone never &lt;br /&gt;determines outcome; it’s a matter of style plus execution.   My tennis teacher, Jordi Ballester, explains: &lt;br /&gt;“Alcaraz plays a more aggressive game.  Given his high level of talent, as he showed at Wimbledon, if he &lt;br /&gt;has a good day, he can beat Djokovic (or any other opponent).  If he’s off, he may well lose.”    &lt;br /&gt;It’s interesting to note that tennis’s big three presided over an incredible era.  In the 19 years leading up to &lt;br /&gt;Wimbledon 2023, they won a combined 65 –  or 87% –  of the 75 Grand Slam championships.  Notably, &lt;br /&gt;none of them was a “big hitter” in Alcaraz’s mold.  The ir  ability to hit at a fabulous level for four or &lt;br /&gt;five hours without committing many errors was usually enough. &lt;br /&gt;The    Nee  d for Wi&lt;br /&gt;nning Stocks &lt;br /&gt;There have been several times over the course of my career when a small number of stocks have &lt;br /&gt;accounted for a disproportionately large share of the market’s gains.  In this regard, a  lot has been written &lt;br /&gt;about the so-called “magnificent seven”:  Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, &lt;br /&gt;Nvidia, Tesla,  and Meta (owner of Facebook).  At various points in time this year, these seven stocks &lt;br /&gt;accounted for most or all of the gains of various equity indices.   Here’s how the Financial Times put it in &lt;br /&gt;June:    &lt;br /&gt;Seven of the biggest constituents . . . have ripped higher, gaining between 40 per cent and &lt;br /&gt;180 per cent this year.  The remaining 493 companies [in the Standard &amp; P  oor’s    500 &lt;br /&gt;stock index] are, in aggregate, flat.   &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.5All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big tech companies dominate the index to an unprecedented degree.  Just five of those &lt;br /&gt;seven stocks represent nearly a quarter of the market capitalisation of the entire index.  &lt;br /&gt;(“The seven companies driving the US stock market rally,” Financial Times, June 14 , &lt;br /&gt;2023 .)&lt;br /&gt;The extent of these stocks’ outperformance for much of this year may be unique, but the phenomenon is &lt;br /&gt;not.  It was also the case in 2017 that a few stocks were largely responsible for carrying the market &lt;br /&gt;upward.  Then it was the   “FAANGs”: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alphabet.  The &lt;br /&gt;Financial Times highlighted this history as well:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Top -heaviness, particularly in US markets, is not new.  “The big tech stocks in the S&amp;P &lt;br /&gt;now are the same situation as oil companies were in the past, or the Nifty 50 in the &lt;br /&gt;1960s,” says Frédéric Leroux, head of the cross-asset team at Carmignac in Paris –  a nod &lt;br /&gt;to the craze that swept shares in a small number of fast-growing companies such as IBM, &lt;br /&gt;Kodak and Xerox higher before a heavy decline set in.   “It’s a problem, but it’s a &lt;br /&gt;recurring problem.”   (Ibid.) &lt;br /&gt;For as long as most of us can remember, active investors  have had a tough time keeping up with the &lt;br /&gt;equity indices.  For this reason, in recent decades, passive investing has taken a substantial share of equity &lt;br /&gt;capital invested.  Active investing’s shortfall has been attributed primarily to the combination of market &lt;br /&gt;efficiency, management fees, and investor error.  I think there’s another reason: active investors’ need for &lt;br /&gt;winners. &lt;br /&gt;What if you didn’t own the magnificent seven earlier this year?  Clearly, you’d be far behind the indices.  &lt;br /&gt;What if you owned them, but in smaller proportions than their weightings in the indices?  You’d still lag, &lt;br /&gt;but by a smaller amount.  So, by definition, keeping up with the indices requires having exposure to &lt;br /&gt;the big winners that is at least equal to their representation in the indices.    That much seems clear. &lt;br /&gt;Now, think about that representation.  Let’s say you started off 20 years ago –  in the summer of 2003 – &lt;br /&gt;with an index-sized helping of Apple at a split-adjusted price of $0.37.  The key question is simple: &lt;br /&gt;Would you have held on as it rose?  &lt;br /&gt;As I described in my memo Selling Out (January 2022),  most investors  to the conventional &lt;br /&gt;wisdom of “taking profits,” “taking some money off the table,”  or “topping the trees.”  After all, as the &lt;br /&gt;old saying goes, “No one ever went broke taking profits.”  Investors often sell off some of their winners &lt;br /&gt;for the simple reason that they’re afraid to watch as they give up their gains, which can lead to regret, &lt;br /&gt;criticism from clients, and/or lost accounts.  &lt;br /&gt;Most people would have sold part or all of their Apple holding by the time the  price reached $15 in the &lt;br /&gt;summer of 2013.  What would you have done when it hit 40 times your original cost after 10 years?  &lt;br /&gt;Toda   y, another 10 years later, Apple is around $180&lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt; –  up 12   x since 2013 and up   by almost 500x since &lt;br /&gt;2003.  The point is, in the face of these gains, very few investors would still hold all they’d originally &lt;br /&gt;bought.  But  if they sold Apple stock when the constructors of the index didn’t, they’ve probably &lt;br /&gt;failed to keep up with the index.   The    situation can be summed up as follows: &lt;br /&gt;1&lt;br /&gt; This reflects the price as of September 8, 2023. &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.6All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•The performance of the equity indices is often dominated by a few stocks or groups of stocks.&lt;br /&gt;•The gains of the leaders can make them seem expensive, arguing for profit-taking.&lt;br /&gt;•Human nature –  especially the desire to avoid regret –  adds to the motivation to sell.&lt;br /&gt;•By definition, if you reduce your holdings of the winners relative to their representation in the&lt;br /&gt;indices and these winners continue to outperform, you’ll have a tough time keeping up.&lt;br /&gt;In my memo Liquidity (March 2015), I included an insight from my son Andrew.  To paraphrase, he said, &lt;br /&gt;“If y  ou look at the chart of a stock that’s been up for 25 years and say, ‘Man, I wish I’d owned that stock,’ &lt;br /&gt;think about all the days you would have had to talk yourself out of selling.”  I doubt many people watched &lt;br /&gt;Apple go from $0.37 to $180 without selling any.     How many active investors would allow Apple shares &lt;br /&gt;to constitute nearly 8% of their portfolios, which was   its weight in the S&amp;P 500 at the recent peak?  But – &lt;br /&gt;to oversimplify –  if they sold Apple, they’ve  lagged.  &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that   winners aren’t entirely dispensable.  If you hope to at least keep up with the &lt;br /&gt;indices, you probably have to have an average representation in them.  (This isn’t entirely inescapable. &lt;br /&gt;You might also achieve that goal by holding fewer of the losers.)  &lt;br /&gt;The Role of Risk Bearing &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to conclude this memo using my favorite graph.  When I attended graduate school at the &lt;br /&gt;University of Chicago 55 (!) years ago, I was taught to view the relationship between risk and return as &lt;br /&gt;follows: &lt;br /&gt;But the more I thought about it, the more unhappy I was with the way the linear presentation of th  e &lt;br /&gt;purported relationship tells investors that   they can count on achieving higher returns as a result of taking &lt;br /&gt;more risk.  After all, if that were really the case, risky investments wouldn’t be riskier.  Thus, in my &lt;br /&gt;memo Risk    (January 2006), I suggested a  different way of  depicting the relationship by   superimposing on &lt;br /&gt;the line a series of bell-shaped probability distributions turned on their side: &lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.7All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than implying that taking  more risk –  moving from left to right in the graph –  assures higher &lt;br /&gt;returns, this new way of looking at the relationship suggests that as you take more risk, (a) the expected &lt;br /&gt;return increases, as per the original version above; (b) the range of possible outcomes becomes wider; and &lt;br /&gt;(c) t  he bad possibilities become worse.  In other words, riskier investments introduce the potential for&lt;br /&gt;higher returns, but also   the possibility of other less-desirable side effects.  That’s why they’re described as&lt;br /&gt;being riskier.  Since writing that memo, I’ve concluded that this way of thinking about things has a great&lt;br /&gt;many applications.  Here are a few:&lt;br /&gt;Investing  &lt;br /&gt; Bonds  Equities     Venture &lt;br /&gt; Capital &lt;br /&gt;Fixed Income &lt;br /&gt; Treasurys       Corporates         High Yield Bond s &lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.8All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities &lt;br /&gt;    U.S.     Non  -U.S  .         Emerging &lt;br /&gt;   Markets &lt;br /&gt;There are also applications for this way of seeing things outside the investment world.  For example: &lt;br /&gt;Tennis Strategies &lt;br /&gt; Djokovic’s  Alcaraz’s    Eubanks’s &lt;br /&gt; Game  Game  Game  &lt;br /&gt;And that brings me back to the subject of this memo:  &lt;br /&gt;Investment Styles &lt;br /&gt; Avoiding Losers       Going for Winners &lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;Risk&lt;br /&gt;Return&lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.9All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the above graphs indicate, a high  -risk approach introduces the potential for huge returns . . . as &lt;br /&gt;well as the possibility of loss. &lt;br /&gt;So,   where’s the right place to be on this spectrum?  Where can one find the best risk/return bargains?  The &lt;br /&gt;short answer is that, according to investment theory –  particularly the Efficient Market Hypothesis –  there &lt;br /&gt;are no better (or worse) places to be.  The EMH says markets price securities such that (a) their price &lt;br /&gt;equals their     intrinsic value and (b)   bearing incremental risk is rewarded fairly.  Thus, bargains and &lt;br /&gt;over   -pricings can’t exist.  This is why, according to the theory, “you can’t beat the market.”  &lt;br /&gt;The theory also suggests that if a market is at “equilibrium,” each change in prospective return is fair &lt;br /&gt;relative to the change in risk borne, such that all positions on the curve are equivalent in attractiveness. &lt;br /&gt;Move to the left, and you avoid some risk, but your prospective return drops.  Move to the right, and your &lt;br /&gt;prospective return increases, but so does your risk.  No position on the spectrum is superior to any other. &lt;br /&gt;It’s like a coin toss (which the EMH suggests active investing is): Neither heads nor tails is the smarter &lt;br /&gt;call.  &lt;br /&gt;What About in Practice? &lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite quotes is attributed to Albert Einstein and Yogi Berra, among others: “In theory, there &lt;br /&gt;is no difference between theory and practice.  In practice, there is.”  If markets are efficient and securities &lt;br /&gt;are always priced correctly, there can be no value in active investing.  The truth is that many active &lt;br /&gt;managers, especially in developed market equities, have failed to demonstrate the ability to add value, or &lt;br /&gt;to add enough value to justify their management fees.  This is largely why index funds were created and &lt;br /&gt;why a significant amount of equity capital has migrated to index and passive investing in recent decades. &lt;br /&gt;And yet, I firmly believe there are times when the markets are overpriced and times when they’re &lt;br /&gt;underpriced.  There are also times when particular markets or sectors are overpriced or underpriced &lt;br /&gt;relative to others.  In these instances, some securities can be priced too high or too low, and thus some &lt;br /&gt;positions on the risk curve can offer better bargains than others. &lt;br /&gt;The theory assumes investors are rational and objective, but psychological excesses violate that &lt;br /&gt;assumption.  Take, for   example, the investment environment during the Global Financial Crisis.  As I &lt;br /&gt;described in my   July   memo Taking the Temperature, in late 2008, investors were so worried about a &lt;br /&gt;financial sector meltdown that they panicked and sold securities aggressively as their prices collapsed. &lt;br /&gt;Excessive risk aversion causes the risk/return line to steepen (increasing the return for each incremental &lt;br /&gt;unit of risk b   orne  ) and perhaps even to curve upward (rendering the compensation for making &lt;br /&gt;investments at the risky end of the spectrum disproportionately generous).  Thus, in periods of excessive &lt;br /&gt;risk aversion, the riskier part of the curve can   be the smarter place to be (and in periods when risk bearing &lt;br /&gt;is too eagerly embraced, the safer part can offer a superior proposition). &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.10All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last element I want to touch on is what I call “alpha,” or individual investing skill.  The reason the &lt;br /&gt;EMH disdains efforts to beat the market is its conviction that since securities are always priced correctly, &lt;br /&gt;the ability to identify bargains to buy and over-pricings to avoid can’t exist.  Theory’s assertion that &lt;br /&gt;there’s no such thing as mastery of markets implies that   no one has the skill to assemble portfolios that &lt;br /&gt;outperform.  This is why I depict the bell-shaped curves above as symmetrical: In an efficient market, &lt;br /&gt;investors can only take what the market gives them. &lt;br /&gt;But I’m convinced the potential to improve on that through skill does exist in some markets and some &lt;br /&gt;people.  Investors who   possess alpha have the ability to alter the shape of the distributions  in the &lt;br /&gt;graphs above so   that    they’re not symmetrical, in that the portion of the distribution representing &lt;br /&gt;the less desirable outcomes is smaller than the portion representing the better ones.  In fact, that’s &lt;br /&gt;what alpha really means: Investors with alpha can go into a market and, by applying their skill, &lt;br /&gt;access the upside pote  ntial offered in that market without taking on all the downside risk.   In my &lt;br /&gt;memo What Really Matters? (November 2022), I  said the key characteristic of superior investing is &lt;br /&gt;asymmetry –  having more upside than downside.  Alpha enables exceptional investors to modify the &lt;br /&gt;probability distributions such that they are biased toward the positive, resulting in superior risk-adjusted &lt;br /&gt;returns.  &lt;br /&gt;If alpha is the ability to earn return without taking fully commensurate risk, investors possessing it &lt;br /&gt;can do so by   either reducing risk while giving up less return or by    increasing  potential return with &lt;br /&gt;a less-than  -commensurate increase in risk.  In other words, skill can enable some investors to &lt;br /&gt;outperform by emphasizing aggressiveness and some by emphasizing defensiveness.  The choice between &lt;br /&gt;these approaches depends on the type of alpha an investor possesses: Is it the ability to produce stunning &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.11All Rights Reserved©&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;returns with tolerable risk, or the ability to produce good returns with minimal risk?  Almost no investors &lt;br /&gt;possess both forms of alpha, and most possess neither.  Investors who lack alpha shouldn’t expect to be &lt;br /&gt;able to produce either version of asymmetry –  that is, to be able to generate superior risk-adjusted &lt;br /&gt;returns.  However, most believe they do have it. &lt;br /&gt;The proper choice between the two approaches – fewer losers or more winners – depends on each   &lt;br /&gt;investor’s skill,  return aspiration,  and risk tolerance.  As with many of the things I discuss, there’s no &lt;br /&gt;right answer here.  Just a choice. &lt;br /&gt;September 12, 2023 &lt;br /&gt;2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.12All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;©2023 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   The Indispensability of Risk &lt;br /&gt;Oftentimes, we’re best able to understand something we’re interested in through analogies that clarify the &lt;br /&gt;matter by establishing connections between it and other parts of life.  That’s why I’ve written a memo &lt;br /&gt;comparing investing to sports in each of the four decades I’ve been writing memos and one connecting &lt;br /&gt;investing and card playing in 2020.  &lt;br /&gt;The motivation for this memo comes from an article in The Wall Street Journal of April 12 that my &lt;br /&gt;partner Bruce Karsh sent me entitled “Chess Teaches the Power of Sacrifice” by Maurice Ashley, a chess &lt;br /&gt;grandmaster who has been inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame.  Few people know that Bruce is a &lt;br /&gt;chess player, and I hadn’t thought about this fact for years, but the article provided a good reminder and &lt;br /&gt;moved me to dash off this memo.  &lt;br /&gt;As is obvious from the article’s title, the piece is mostly about the role of sacrifice.  Ashley says, “Many &lt;br /&gt;positions cannot be won or saved without something of value being given away, from a lowly pawn all &lt;br /&gt;the way up to the mighty queen.”  Intentionally losing a piece as part of one’s gameplan is the sacrifice &lt;br /&gt;that Ashley is referencing. &lt;br /&gt;•He describes some sacrifices as “shams,” (a term coined by chess master Rudolf Spielmann in his&lt;br /&gt;book The Art of Sacrifice in Chess) where “. . .    one can easily see that the piece being given up&lt;br /&gt;will return concrete benefits that can be clearly calculated.”  In other words, I put a piece in clear&lt;br /&gt;jeopardy, but I do this so that I’ll be able to take one of yours of greater value.&lt;br /&gt;•Others are deemed “real” sacrifices, where “. . . giving away a piece offers gains that are neither&lt;br /&gt;immediate nor tangible.   The return on investment might be controlling more space, creating an&lt;br /&gt;assailable weakness in the opponent’s position, or having more pieces in the critical sector of&lt;br /&gt;attack.”&lt;br /&gt;The analogy to investing begins to become clear.  Buying a 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a modest or &lt;br /&gt;“sham” sacrifice.  You give up the use of your money for ten years, but that’s only an opportunity cost, &lt;br /&gt;and accepting it brings the certainty of interest income.  Most other investments involve real sacrifices, &lt;br /&gt;though, where the risk of loss is borne in pursuit of “gains that are neither immediate nor tangible.” &lt;br /&gt;Ashley goes on to speak of sacrifice in risk/return terms that are familiar to investors.  He describes his &lt;br /&gt;mother’s decision to leave him (at age two) and his two siblings in Jamaica and travel to the U.S. in &lt;br /&gt;search of a better life for herself and for them.  She reached her goal a decade later and was able to bring &lt;br /&gt;her kids to the U.S., where they would find success in a variety of fields: &lt;br /&gt;It did not have to turn out that way.   It did because she was willing to stomach the key &lt;br /&gt;aspect of making real sacrifices: the willingness to take risks.   For a chess player, risk is &lt;br /&gt;as much intuited as it is calculated.  Due to the inherent complexity of the game, it is &lt;br /&gt;virtually impossible to assess with certainty whether a risky move will pay off in the end. &lt;br /&gt;It’s up to the player to decide if sufficient conditions have been met to take the &lt;br /&gt;chance on a risky move. . . . &lt;br /&gt;All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know, however, is that the famous saying “No risk, no reward” is true in &lt;br /&gt;many cases.  A skilled adversary is normally able to handle solid, conservative play and &lt;br /&gt;therefore able to  rob us of opportunities that may be inherent in our position.  As   [five   -&lt;br /&gt;time world chess champion] Magnus Carlsen put it, “Not being willing to take risks is an &lt;br /&gt;extremely risky strategy.”  (Emphasis added) &lt;br /&gt;And there you have it: the indispensability of risk. &lt;br /&gt;The Risk of Not Taking Risk &lt;br /&gt;Because the future is inherently uncertain, we usually have to choose between (a) avoiding risk and &lt;br /&gt;having little or no return, (b) taking a modest risk and settling for a commensurately modest return, or (c) &lt;br /&gt;taking on a high degree of uncertainty in pursuit of substantial gain but accepting the possibility of &lt;br /&gt;substantial permanent loss.  Everyone would love a shot at earning big gains with little risk, but the &lt;br /&gt;“efficiency” of the market –  meaning the fact that the other participants in the market aren’t dummies – &lt;br /&gt;usually precludes this possibility. &lt;br /&gt;Most investors are capable of accomplishing “a” and most of “b.”  The challenge in investing lies in the &lt;br /&gt;pursuit of some version of “c.”  Earning high returns –  in absolute terms or relative to other &lt;br /&gt;investors in a market –  requires  that you bear meaningful risk   –  either the   possibility of loss in the &lt;br /&gt;pursuit of absolute gain or the possibility of underperformance in the pursuit of outperformance.  &lt;br /&gt;In each case, the two are inseparable.  As Ashley says, no risk, no reward.  No pain, no gain. &lt;br /&gt;The risk inherent in not taking enough risk is very real.  Individual investors who eschew risk may end up &lt;br /&gt;with a return that is insufficient to support their cost of living.  And professional investors who take too &lt;br /&gt;little risk may fail to keep up with their clients’ expectations or their benchmarks. &lt;br /&gt;Like chess (and most card games), backgammon requires the calculation of when to take risk and when to &lt;br /&gt;avoid it.  In backgammon, two players move their checkers around the board based on throws of a pair of &lt;br /&gt;dice.  One player moves clockwise and the other counterclockwise.  When players’ checkers come near &lt;br /&gt;each other, the player who’s moving often has a choice between (a) landing on one of the other player’s &lt;br /&gt;checkers, sending it back to the start (but at the risk of leaving the moving checker in a vulnerable &lt;br /&gt;position), and (b) avoiding doing so to play it safe.  No one wants to be exposed and get hit.  But most &lt;br /&gt;beginners play it too safe, and because they put so much emphasis on avoiding getting hit, they rarely &lt;br /&gt;win.   &lt;br /&gt;Relevant lessons from sports (included in past memos) are easily accessed and also very helpful: &lt;br /&gt;•“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” –  Wayne Gretzky, NHL Hall of Famer&lt;br /&gt;•“You have to give yourself a chance to fail.” –  Kenny “The Jet” Smith, two-time NBA champion&lt;br /&gt;I’ll   sum up with a paragraph from my memo of last September, Fewer Losers, or More Winners? &lt;br /&gt;The    final    sentence says a great deal about sacrifice and risk: &lt;br /&gt;. . . not &lt;br /&gt;having any losers isn’t a useful goal.  The only sure way to achieve that is by not &lt;br /&gt;taking any risk.  But ... risk avoidance is likely to result in return avoidance.  There’s &lt;br /&gt;such a thing as the risk of taking too little risk.  Most people understand this &lt;br /&gt;intellectually, but human nature makes it hard for many to accept the idea that the &lt;br /&gt;willingness to live with some losses is an essential ingredient in investment success. &lt;br /&gt;2All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to Think About Risk-Taking &lt;br /&gt;The paradox of risk-taking is inescapable.  You have to take it to be successful in competitive, high-&lt;br /&gt;aspiration arenas.  But taking it doesn’t mean you’ll be successful; that’s why they call it risk. &lt;br /&gt;Equally paradoxical, earning a high rate of return over a long time period doesn’t have to –  and usually &lt;br /&gt;doesn’t –  connote a record of consistent success.  More often it results  from having made a lot of well-&lt;br /&gt;reasoned investments, some subset of which worked out well   .  Here’s how I described the basis    for   the &lt;br /&gt;success of Berkshire Hathaway in Fewer Losers, or More Winners?:  &lt;br /&gt;I believe the ingredients of Warren [Buffett]’s and Charlie [Munger]’s great performance &lt;br /&gt;are  simple: (a) a lot of    investments in which they did decently,  (b) a relatively small &lt;br /&gt;number of big winners that   they invested in heavily and held   for decades,  and (c) &lt;br /&gt;relatively few big losers.  No one should expect to have –  or expect their money &lt;br /&gt;managers to have –  all big winners and no losers. &lt;br /&gt;Investors must    accept that success is likely to stem from making a large number of investments, all &lt;br /&gt;of   which you make because you expect them to succeed, but some portion of which you know won’t. &lt;br /&gt;You have to put it all out there.  You have to take a shot.  Not every effort will be rewarded with high &lt;br /&gt;returns, but hopefully enough will do so to produce success over the long term.  That success will &lt;br /&gt;ultimately be a function of the ratio of winners to losers, and of the magnitude of the losses relative to the &lt;br /&gt;gains.  But refusal to take risk in this process is unlikely to get you where you want to go. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll conclude with another good paragraph from Ashley: &lt;br /&gt;Taking a chance doesn’t mean there will be a successful outcome, nor does it require it. &lt;br /&gt;If the reasons are sound, the risk should be taken almost reflexively.   The more often we &lt;br /&gt;trust our judgment, the more confidence we gain in our decision-making capacity.  The &lt;br /&gt;courage to take risks becomes a worthwhile end in itself. &lt;br /&gt;The bottom line on the quest for superior investment returns is clear: You shouldn’t expect to make &lt;br /&gt;money without bearing risk, but you shouldn’t expect to make money just for taking risk.  You &lt;br /&gt;have to sacrifice certainty, but it has to be done skillfully and intelligently, and with emotion under &lt;br /&gt;control. &lt;br /&gt;April 17, 2024 &lt;br /&gt;3All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Marks &lt;br /&gt;Re:   Ruminating on Asset Allocation &lt;br /&gt;When I travel t&lt;br /&gt;o see clients and spend entire days discussing investing and the markets, memo ideas often &lt;br /&gt;pop up.  Last month’s visit with clients in Australia is a case in point.  We talked about the “sea change” I &lt;br /&gt;believe is taking place in interest rates and about the role of credit in portfolios, and in a few cases, this &lt;br /&gt;led to the general topic of asset allocation.  The result wasn’t a lot of new ideas on the subject, but rather a &lt;br /&gt;new way to combine old ideas into a unified theory. &lt;br /&gt;Before I proceed, I want to mention that, from time to time in this memo, I’ll say “generally,” “usually,” &lt;br /&gt;or “everything else being equal.”  These caveats are likely applicable to many more sentences and ideas &lt;br /&gt;herein, but for the sake of readability, I’m not going to repeat them ad nauseum.  In addition, I’m going to &lt;br /&gt;use a lot of graphics, as I truly believe one picture is worth a thousand words.  Please bear in mind that &lt;br /&gt;these representations are intended to be notional, not technically correct. &lt;br /&gt;Asset Classes &lt;br /&gt;From my vantage &lt;br /&gt;point, “asset allocation” is a relatively new thing.  No one used that phrase when I &lt;br /&gt;joined the industry 55 years ago.  Structuring portfolios was a pretty simple matter, generally following &lt;br /&gt;the classic “60/40” split.   Most U.S. investors limited themselves to investing in U.S. stocks and bonds, &lt;br /&gt;and there was a time-honored notion that something like 60% equities and 40% bonds represented &lt;br /&gt;reasonable diversification.   &lt;br /&gt;Today, investors are presented with so many choices –  and there’s so much emphasis on getting the &lt;br /&gt;decision right –  that the term “asset allocation” is very prominent, and there are individuals and whole &lt;br /&gt;departments dedicated to doing just that.  It’s their job to decide how to weight the asset classes to be held &lt;br /&gt;in a portfolio, meaning asset allocators spend their time on decisions like these: &lt;br /&gt;•How much in equiti&lt;br /&gt;es and how much in debt?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in stocks and bonds and how much in “alternatives”?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in public securities and how much in private assets?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in one’s home country and how much abroad?&lt;br /&gt;•How much of the latter in the developed world and how much in emerging markets?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in high quality assets and how much in low quality?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in more volatile “high beta” assets and how much in steadier ones?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in levered strategies and how much unlevered?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in “real assets”?&lt;br /&gt;•How much in derivatives?&lt;br /&gt;It’s enough to m&lt;br /&gt;ake your head spin.  Many investors use computer models to help with these decisions, &lt;br /&gt;but the models require inputs regarding expected return, risk, and correlation, and most of these are based &lt;br /&gt;on history and thus of questionable relevance to the future.  Correlation between asset classes is &lt;br /&gt;particularly difficult to predict.  It’s often a case of garbage in, garbage out (but with the added comfort &lt;br /&gt;that comes from using mathematical models).  &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since coming up with my sea change thesis regarding interest rates two years ago, I’ve been talking &lt;br /&gt;about the increased utility of credit investments.  And the more I’ve done so, the more I’ve thought about &lt;br /&gt;the difference between credit investments and equities.   Thus, the first thing I want to mention about &lt;br /&gt;my “Australian epiphany” is the unconventional idea that, at bottom, there are only two asset &lt;br /&gt;classes: ownership and debt.  If someone wants to participate financially in a business, the essential &lt;br /&gt;choice is between (a) owning part of it and (b) making a loan to it.    &lt;br /&gt;When I moved fr&lt;br /&gt;om Citibank’s equity research department to its bond department in 1978, I learned &lt;br /&gt;firsthand that this is a matter of night and day.  On my new desk, I found a machine called a Monroe &lt;br /&gt;360/65 Bond Trader.  If you typed in a bond’s interest rate, maturity date, and market price, it would tell &lt;br /&gt;you the yield to maturity . . . in other words, what your return would be if you bought the bond at that &lt;br /&gt;price and held it to maturity (and it paid).  This was revolutionary to me.  On the equity side I’d come &lt;br /&gt;from, there was no place you could look to find out what your return would be.    &lt;br /&gt;This highlighted for me something I’ve always felt most investors don’t grasp viscerally: the essential &lt;br /&gt;difference between stocks and bonds . . . that is, between ownership and lending.  Investors seem to think &lt;br /&gt;of stocks and bonds as two things that fall under the same heading.  But the difference is enormous.  In &lt;br /&gt;fact, ownership and lending have nothing in common: &lt;br /&gt;•Owners put t&lt;br /&gt;heir money at risk with no promise of a return.  They acquire a piece of a business or&lt;br /&gt;other asset and are entitled to their proportional share of any residual that remains after the&lt;br /&gt;necessary payments have been made to employees, providers of raw materials, landlords, tax&lt;br /&gt;authorities, and, of course, lenders.  If there’s something left over, it’s called profit or cash flow,&lt;br /&gt;and the owners have the right to share in whatever part of it is paid out.  And if there’s profit or&lt;br /&gt;cash flow (or the potential for it in the future), the business will have “enterprise value,” in which&lt;br /&gt;the owners also share.&lt;br /&gt;•Lenders typically provide funds to help owners purchase or operate businesses or other assets&lt;br /&gt;and, in exchange, are promised periodic interest and the repayment of principal at the end.  The&lt;br /&gt;relationship between borrower and lender is contractual, and the resulting return is known in&lt;br /&gt;advance as described above, again assuming the borrower makes the promised payments when&lt;br /&gt;due.  That’s why this kind of investing is called “fixed income” –  the income is fixed.  For the&lt;br /&gt;purposes of this memo, however, it might help to think of it as “fixed outcome” investing.&lt;br /&gt;This isn’t &lt;br /&gt;a difference in degree; it’s a difference in kind.   Ownership assets (things like common &lt;br /&gt;stocks, whole companies, real estate, private equity, and real assets) and debt (bonds, loans, mortgage &lt;br /&gt;backed securities, and other streams of promised payments) should be thought of as entirely different, not &lt;br /&gt;variations on a theme.  They have different characteristics and potential, and the choice between them is &lt;br /&gt;one of the most basic things investors must decide. &lt;br /&gt;The Essent&lt;br /&gt;ial Choice &lt;br /&gt;At the outse&lt;br /&gt;t of this memo, I listed some of the decisions that comprise the asset allocation process.  But &lt;br /&gt;how can those decisions be approached?  What’s the framework for making them?   &lt;br /&gt;The next pie&lt;br /&gt;ce that clicked into place in my thinking “down under” was with regard to the basic &lt;br /&gt;characteristics of a portfolio.  In my opinion, one decision matters more than –  and should set the &lt;br /&gt;basis for –  all the other decisions in the portfolio management process.  It’s the selection of a &lt;br /&gt;targeted “risk posture,” or the desired balance between aggressiveness and defensiveness.  The &lt;br /&gt;essential decision in investing is how much emphasis one should put on preserving capital and how much &lt;br /&gt;on growing it.  These two things are mostly mutually exclusive: &lt;br /&gt;2 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Insistence on preserving capital –  or, secondarily, on limiting the portfolio’s volatility –  calls for&lt;br /&gt;an emphasis on defense, which precludes pursuing maximum growth.&lt;br /&gt;•Correspondingly, a decision to strive to maximize growth requires an emphasis on offense,&lt;br /&gt;meaning preservation of capital and steadiness must be sacrificed to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;It’s one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;  You can’t simultaneously emphasize both preservation of capital and &lt;br /&gt;maximization&lt;br /&gt; of&lt;br /&gt; g&lt;br /&gt;r&lt;br /&gt;owth,&lt;br /&gt; or&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;defense and    offense.  This    is the fundamental, inescapable truth in &lt;br /&gt;investing.  The questions listed on page one are just details, the options available for reaching &lt;br /&gt;your targeted risk posture. &lt;br /&gt;If y  o&lt;br /&gt;u think about portfolio c onstruction in this s  ense    – looking for t  he   right balance between offense and &lt;br /&gt;defense – it becomes clear    that the goal   should be   optimization, not   maximization.  To m  y m ind, it &lt;br /&gt;shouldn’t b e  “wealth,” but  “wealth pursued in an appropriate way, ta  king into a ccount the   investor’s &lt;br /&gt;wants and n eeds.”   &lt;br /&gt;Many people  think the proper goal    in investing is a chieving the highest return.  More sophisticated &lt;br /&gt;thinkers understand – either intellectually or  intuitively – that t   he g  oal   should be to achieve the b   est &lt;br /&gt;relationship between return and risk.   If y  ou follow that   latter mandate, it’ll    hopefully lea d you t   o&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;assets whose expecte   d return is  more tha n sufficient to compensate for t  heir    risk, and thus to a portfolio &lt;br /&gt;with t  he p  otential for a  n  att&lt;br /&gt;ractive risk  -adjusted return.  But    that’s not e  nough. &lt;br /&gt;The absolute level of  risk in a portfolio shouldn’t be a  n unwitting consequence   of  the a  sset &lt;br /&gt;allocation process described abov   e, or   of t  he search f   or s  uperior risk -adjusted returns.  The &lt;br /&gt;absolute risk level    must be consciously targete&lt;br /&gt;d.  In fact, in my vie w, i  t’s th  e  most important thing. &lt;br /&gt;For    an investment program to be successful, the level of risk in the portfolio must be well &lt;br /&gt;compensated and    fall within the    desired range . . . neither too much nor too little.   &lt;br /&gt;The Shape of the C   urves &lt;br /&gt;In the   last   few months, I’ve been drawing probability distributions to  illustrate the   fundamental difference &lt;br /&gt;between the p  otential returns from    ownership assets a   nd   debt (or “f  ixed i   ncome,” “credit,” o r w hatever &lt;br /&gt;you    want    to ca  ll i t) .  Here’s  the general shape of t he curve describing the potential return on   a portfolio of &lt;br /&gt;ownership  assets (Figure 1): &lt;br /&gt;And following on&lt;br /&gt; page four is the shape of the curve describing the potential return on a portfolio of debt &lt;br /&gt;(Figure 2): &lt;br /&gt;3 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership as&lt;br /&gt;sets typically have a higher expected return, greater upside potential, and greater &lt;br /&gt;downside risk.  Everything else being equal, the expected returns from debt are lower but likely to &lt;br /&gt;fall within a much tighter range.  There’s generally no upside on debt –  no one should buy an 8% bond &lt;br /&gt;expecting to make more than 8% per year over the long term.  But there’s also relatively little downside – &lt;br /&gt;you’ll get your 8% if the borrower pays, and relatively few fail to pay.  For this reason, offense is usually &lt;br /&gt;better played through ownership assets, and defense is usually better played through debt.  (I hasten to &lt;br /&gt;add that investing isn’t a matter of either/or.  The two can be combined, meaning the operative question &lt;br /&gt;surrounds the right mix.) &lt;br /&gt;In the low-inter&lt;br /&gt;est -rate environment that prevailed from 2009 through 2021, the expected return from &lt;br /&gt;debt was extremely low in the absolute and far below the historical return on equities, rendering debt &lt;br /&gt;relatively unattractive (Figure 3).   &lt;br /&gt;But today, it’s considerably higher than it was and closer to that of equities (Figure 4).  That’s why I’ve &lt;br /&gt;been urging increased investment in credit. &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, t&lt;br /&gt;he relationship between the two curves at a point in time has a very direct bearing on the &lt;br /&gt;appropriate asset allocation at that time.   &lt;br /&gt;4 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the two is “better,” ownership or debt?  We can’t say.  In a market with any degree of &lt;br /&gt;efficiency –  that is, rationality –  it’s just a tradeoff.  A higher expected return with further upside &lt;br /&gt;potential, at the cost of greater uncertainty, volatility, and downside risk?  Or a more dependable &lt;br /&gt;but lower expected return, entailing less upside and less downside?   The choice between the two is &lt;br /&gt;subjective, largely a function of the investor’s circumstances and attitude toward bearing risk.  That &lt;br /&gt;means the answer will be different for different investors. &lt;br /&gt;Choosing t&lt;br /&gt;he Offense/Defense Balance &lt;br /&gt;I’ve previous&lt;br /&gt;ly expressed my view that, as a starting point, every investor or their investment manager &lt;br /&gt;should identify their appropriate normal risk posture or offense/defense balance.  For each individual or &lt;br /&gt;institution, this decision should be informed by the investor’s investment horizon, financial condition, &lt;br /&gt;income, needs, aspirations, responsibilities, and, crucially, intestinal fortitude, or their ability to stomach &lt;br /&gt;ups and downs.   &lt;br /&gt;Once investors have specified the normal risk posture that’s right for them, they face a choice: they can &lt;br /&gt;maintain that posture all the time, or they can opt to depart from it on occasion in response to the &lt;br /&gt;movements of the market and thus changes in the attractiveness of the offerings it provides, increasing &lt;br /&gt;their emphasis on offense when the market is beaten down and on defense when it’s riding high.   &lt;br /&gt;Regardless &lt;br /&gt;of whether one’s risk posture is fixed or variable, however, the next question is how one gets &lt;br /&gt;there.  This question led me to think about another old idea: the relationship between risk and return.  I’ve &lt;br /&gt;described a million times the way this was taught at the University of Chicago, beginning when I was &lt;br /&gt;there in the 1960s.  It’s a graphical presentation we’ve all seen ever since, in which, as we move from left &lt;br /&gt;to right, increasing the expected risk, the expected return also increases (Figure 5):    &lt;br /&gt;As readers k&lt;br /&gt;now, I always felt this representation was highly inadequate, since the linearity of the &lt;br /&gt;relationship in the graph makes it appear too certain that increased risk will lead to increased &lt;br /&gt;return.  This obviously belies the nature of risk.   So, in a memo in 2006, I took the same line and &lt;br /&gt;superimposed on it some bell-shaped curves representing probability distributions turned on their side.  I &lt;br /&gt;did this to indicate the uncertain nature of returns from riskier assets (Figure 6): &lt;br /&gt;5 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we see&lt;br /&gt; that as the thing called “risk” increases (that is, as we move from left to right on the &lt;br /&gt;graph), not only does the expected return increase, but the range of possible outcomes becomes &lt;br /&gt;wider and the bad outcomes become worse.   That’s risk!  (I hope this way of presenting risk will be &lt;br /&gt;considered a lasting contribution to the investment industry when I’m gone.) &lt;br /&gt;Doodling one&lt;br /&gt; day, I took the black and green curves describing ownership asset returns and debt returns &lt;br /&gt;from Figure 4 and added some intermediate positions in blue and red to indicate various combinations of &lt;br /&gt;the two.  Thus, the blue curve is 2/3 debt and 1/3 ownership, and the red is 1/3 debt and 2/3 ownership &lt;br /&gt;(Figure 7): &lt;br /&gt;In Australi&lt;br /&gt;a, as I was showing this diagram, it struck me that Figure 7 is just another way to represent the &lt;br /&gt;idea presented in Figure 6.  Again, as we move from left to right (more ownership assets, less debt), the &lt;br /&gt;expected return increases and the expected risk increases (that is, just as in Figure 6, the range of possible &lt;br /&gt;outcomes grows wider and the left-hand tail stretches further into undesirable territory).  This way of &lt;br /&gt;presenting the options might be more intuitively clear. &lt;br /&gt;Someone who b&lt;br /&gt;elieves in “more risk, more return” as portrayed in Figure 5 should logically adopt a high-&lt;br /&gt;risk posture.  But if they understand the real implications of increased risk, as suggested by Figures 6 and &lt;br /&gt;7, then they might opt for something more moderate.   &lt;br /&gt;The Role of Alpha and Beta &lt;br /&gt;All the for&lt;br /&gt;egoing assumes markets are efficient: &lt;br /&gt;•As risk incr&lt;br /&gt;eases in an efficient market, expected return increases proportionally.  Or maybe that’s&lt;br /&gt;better stated the other way around: as expected return increases, so does the accompanying risk&lt;br /&gt;(the uncertainty surrounding the outcome and the likelihood of a bad one).  Thus, no position on&lt;br /&gt;the risk continuum (for example, in Figure 6) is “better” than any other.  It’s all just a matter of&lt;br /&gt;where you want to come out in terms of absolute riskiness, or what absolute level of return you&lt;br /&gt;6 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;want to aim for.  The ratio of return to risk is similar at all points on the continuum –  less of &lt;br /&gt;both toward the left, and more of both toward the right.  Said another way, there’s no free lunch.  &lt;br /&gt;•Also, looking at each position on the risk continuum, the symmetricalness of the vertical&lt;br /&gt;distribution of possible returns around the expected return is similar from one position to&lt;br /&gt;the next.   That means the ratio of upside potential to downside risk at one position on the&lt;br /&gt;continuum isn’t markedly better than it is at other positions –  again no free lunch.&lt;br /&gt;•Finally, if you want to move further out on the risk continuum, you can do so by either (a)&lt;br /&gt;investing in riskier assets or (b) applying leverage to the same assets (magnifying both the&lt;br /&gt;expected return and risk).  Again, in a fully efficient market, neither tactic is preferable to the&lt;br /&gt;other.&lt;br /&gt;The above three statements capture some of  the  important implications of supposed market efficiency. &lt;br /&gt;Looked at this wa&lt;br /&gt;y, the only thing that matters is getting to the right    risk position for you; under an &lt;br /&gt;assumpti&lt;br /&gt;on   of market efficiency, there’s nothing to b e  gained in ter&lt;br /&gt;ms   of return at a  given  level    of &lt;br /&gt;risk.     All w   ays   of  getting to  a  certain risk l   evel will p  roduce the same expected return. &lt;br /&gt;The r   eason f   or  this    is  the   academic view    th&lt;br /&gt;at,   in a  n e fficient market, (a) all a ssets are  priced fairly r elative &lt;br /&gt;to  each oth&lt;br /&gt;er,  such    that t   here are n  o bargains or  over  -pricings to take advantage of  and (   b) t  here’s no such &lt;br /&gt;thing as alpha, which I define as “ gains r esulting from superior individual skill.”  As a result, the  re’s &lt;br /&gt;nothing to be gained from    active decision&lt;br /&gt; making: no asset class, strategy, s ecurity or m  anager is &lt;br /&gt;“better” t   han any o  the r.   They merely vary i   n t erms of  risk and r  esulting return. &lt;br /&gt;Also    in t he academic view,   since there’s no  such thing    as  alpha, the only thing t hat d   ifferentiates assets is &lt;br /&gt;their    beta  , or  their relativ   e volatilit y, t  he e  xtent    to w  hich t   hey r eflect market    movements.  In t  he t  heor   y,  it’s &lt;br /&gt;beta that expected returns are proportional to. &lt;br /&gt;Now it’&lt;br /&gt;s time for me to assert strenuously that, in reality, markets are   not   efficient in the academic &lt;br /&gt;sense of al ways   bein  g “right.”  Markets may do an e  fficient job   of (  a) r  apidly incorporating new &lt;br /&gt;information an   d (b) a  ccurately reflecting the resulting consensus opinion concerning the right price  for &lt;br /&gt;each    asset given the totality of i nformation, but that   opinion can b  e f ar f  rom correct.     For t   hat r   eason, &lt;br /&gt;gains can   be a  chieved by choosing skillfully among the options:  &lt;br /&gt;•some assets, mark&lt;br /&gt;ets or strategies can offer a better risk/return bargain than others, and&lt;br /&gt;•some managers can   operate within a market or strategy to produce superior risk-adjusted returns.&lt;br /&gt;This last idea&lt;br /&gt; raises one of the key questions in asset allocation: should you consider departing from your &lt;br /&gt;“sweet spot” in terms of risk level in order to invest in a riskier asset class with a manager believed to &lt;br /&gt;possess alpha?  There’s no easy answer to this question, especially given that many managers who are &lt;br /&gt;believed to possess alpha turn out not to.   &lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I’l&lt;br /&gt;l recap the key points: &lt;br /&gt;•Fundamentally&lt;br /&gt; speaking, the only asset classes are ownership and debt.&lt;br /&gt;•They differ enormously in terms of their fundamental nature.&lt;br /&gt;•Ownership assets and debt assets should be combined to get your portfolio to the position on the&lt;br /&gt;risk/return continuum that’s right for you.  This is the most important decision in portfolio&lt;br /&gt;management or asset allocation.&lt;br /&gt;•The other decisions are merely a matter of implementation.&lt;br /&gt;7 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•Of course, your asset allocation process will be informed by how you rate your ability to identify&lt;br /&gt;and access superior strategies and superior managers, recognizing that doing so isn’t easy.&lt;br /&gt;**  *&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the rea&lt;br /&gt;l world, I want to make some important observations regarding one of Oaktree’s key &lt;br /&gt;sectors, non-investment grade credit (defined as performing non-government debt): &lt;br /&gt;•The prospective &lt;br /&gt;returns in this area today are much higher than they were in the 2009-21 period.&lt;br /&gt;•These returns, starting at roughly 7% on public credit and 10% on private credit, are competitive&lt;br /&gt;with   the historical returns on equities and capable of helping many investors toward their overall&lt;br /&gt;return targets.&lt;br /&gt;•Because of their contractual nature, the returns from credit are likely to prove much more&lt;br /&gt;dependable than ownership returns.&lt;br /&gt;In my view, the thoug&lt;br /&gt;ht process set forth in this memo leads to the conclusion that investors &lt;br /&gt;should increase their allocations in this area if they are (a) attracted by returns of 7  -10%  or so, (b) &lt;br /&gt;desirous of limiting uncertainty and volatility, and (c) w illing to forgo upside potential beyond today’s &lt;br /&gt;yields to do so.  For me, that should include a lot of investors, even if not everyone. &lt;br /&gt;My recommendati&lt;br /&gt;on at this time is that investors do the research required to increase their allocation to &lt;br /&gt;credit, establish a “program” for doing so, and take a partial step to implement it.  While today’s potential &lt;br /&gt;returns are attractive in the absolute, higher returns were available on credit a year or two ago, and we &lt;br /&gt;could see them again if markets come to be less ruled by optimism.  I believe there will be such a time.  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for indu&lt;br /&gt;lging me in this foray into investment philosophy.  I hope you’ve found it of value. &lt;br /&gt;October 22, 2024 &lt;br /&gt;8 All Rights Reserved&lt;br /&gt;2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.© 2024 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memo to: Oaktree Clients &lt;br /&gt;From: Howard Ma&lt;br /&gt;rks  &lt;br /&gt;Re:   The Calculu&lt;br /&gt;s of Value &lt;br /&gt;On July 28, I flew&lt;br /&gt; to South America on a plane without Wi-Fi, leaving me without email or entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;What was I to do but start in  on a memo?  Interestingly, the things I wrote during that flight turned out to &lt;br /&gt;be the answers to many of the questions I received from clients after I landed, so writing what follows &lt;br /&gt;served me well.  I hope it’ll do the same for you. &lt;br /&gt;*            *  *&lt;br /&gt;January 2 of this year was the 25&lt;br /&gt;th&lt;br /&gt; anniversary of my memo bubble.com, the one that put my writing on &lt;br /&gt;the map, and I marked the occasion by publishing another memo, called On Bubble Watch.  While the &lt;br /&gt;title may have raised concern for readers, my   main conclusion was that the elevated U.S. stock market &lt;br /&gt;valuations at the &lt;br /&gt;time didn’t necessarily signal    th e existence of  a bubble, m  ainly     because I didn’t det&lt;br /&gt;ect &lt;br /&gt;the  extreme investor psychol   ogy I associate with bubbles.  S&lt;br /&gt;ecurity prices were  “loft  y but not nutty” is &lt;br /&gt;how I pu t i t.   Because a lot  has taken place in t  he s  eve&lt;br /&gt;n m onths   since then, it’ s time for an update on asset &lt;br /&gt;values. &lt;br /&gt;Before I start, please note that I’m t   alking about investing i n ge neral.  My specific reference will be to &lt;br /&gt;public U.S&lt;br /&gt;. co rporate securities – stocks and bonds – since they mark to market regularly and are  the &lt;br /&gt;assets that most   enter my c onsciousness.  But since   investors’ actions toward one group of assets    and the &lt;br /&gt;resulting price movements influence other assets and other mar k&lt;br /&gt;et s – and since they ensue largely from &lt;br /&gt;investor psychology, which is highly contagious – I think my comme&lt;br /&gt;nts  are  probably applicable to other &lt;br /&gt;asset classes, to p  rivate assets as well as public ones, and pos sibly to m ar   kets outside  the U.S.  &lt;br /&gt;I’ll   start   by laying out where   I think  investment value comes from and how it should be assessed.  I don’t &lt;br /&gt;think I’ve ever done this before i   n this   form.  It’s a big topic, but I’ll  try to cover it &lt;br /&gt;briefl   y. &lt;br /&gt;Value   &lt;br /&gt;Investment assets – things s uch as stocks, bonds, c   om pan&lt;br /&gt;ies, and buildings – have a value, which is &lt;br /&gt;sometimes referred to a s their “intrinsic value”: what the asset i s “worth” at a point in  time.  This &lt;br /&gt;value is subjective.  It can’t   definitively be found anywhere – not even   by AI , as far as I  know – and &lt;br /&gt;opinions w ill differ as to what it is.     &lt;br /&gt;In my parlance, t&lt;br /&gt;he value of an asset is derive d from its “fundamentals.”  T&lt;br /&gt;he  fundamentals of a company, &lt;br /&gt;for  example, encompass a great   many things.  These include its  current earnings, its  earning power in the &lt;br /&gt;future, the steadiness or  va riability of i ts  future earnings, the m arket value of i&lt;br /&gt;ts component assets, the &lt;br /&gt;skill    of management, its potential to develop new products, the competitive landscape, the strength of its &lt;br /&gt;balance sheet, and    th e m yriad additional factor  s t hat   will i   nfluence the company’s future.  Ultimately, t   he &lt;br /&gt;totality of an  asset’s fundamentals constitute its earning powe  r, w hich in  turn is the source of its &lt;br /&gt;value.   &lt;br /&gt;   2025 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.© All Rights Reserved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compa   ny may own lan d, buildings, machinery, vehicles, and natural resources such as mineral deposits &lt;br /&gt;or forests, and even facilities that allow it to derive electricity from river water or sunshine (which it &lt;br /&gt;obviously doesn’t own).  These are  tangible assets,    and t   here’s often a market for  them and a realizable &lt;br /&gt;price.  But    a company may    also    have   assets that are intangible, such    as patents, trade secrets, knowhow, &lt;br /&gt;research capability,  reputation and image, human talent, management skill, and culture.  Some of t   hese &lt;br /&gt;may    be transferable and salable, but ot hers are not . &lt;br /&gt;All the   assets mentioned above have e arning power i ndividually, and i n combination they create a &lt;br /&gt;company’s overall   earning power.   A co  mpany’s earning pow er a lmost always exceeds the sum of t he &lt;br /&gt;earning power of each of its  individual assets    take n in &lt;br /&gt;isolation.  Combining individual assets to &lt;br /&gt;maximize a company’s overall    earning power is the top job of management.  When successful, the result &lt;br /&gt;is  synergy: the benefit gained from skillfully combining things. &lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;ut not all  assets    have earning power (as I   define   it) , and thus not al&lt;br /&gt;l have  calculable investment value.  I &lt;br /&gt;describe earning power as the money you can make  by owning and operating an asset – tha&lt;br /&gt;t is, I omit &lt;br /&gt;from “earnings” the possible gains from simply holding an a sset and ultimately selling it.   A d  iamond &lt;br /&gt;ri ng, painting, or classic    car  doesn’t   produce earnings for its  owner (short of renting it out or charging &lt;br /&gt;people to look at it&lt;br /&gt;).  For this reason, its economic potential comes exclusively from the  possibility of &lt;br /&gt;selling it at a profit.  And the person who buys it is likely to be doing so in the hope of selling it to &lt;br /&gt;someone else at a still   -higher price . . . despite the  fact that it won’t   produce earnings in the interim.  I &lt;br /&gt;think of assets t   hat don’t  produce operating cash flow or  have  t he potential to do so  in the future as &lt;br /&gt;not having earning power, and that makes them impossible to value objectively, analytically, or &lt;br /&gt;intrinsically (see my 2010 memo about gold, All That Glitters). &lt;br /&gt;Some earni&lt;br /&gt;ng pow er i s current and  produces i  ncome today.  The result can be s een   in  this year’s financial &lt;br /&gt;statements:    the  income that today’s assets are producing in their    current configuration and under today’s &lt;br /&gt;conditions.  Other earni ng power exists in the form of potential: for  example, the income that   will  be &lt;br /&gt;earned when today’s holdings of natural resources are exploited in the future, or the income that   will  be &lt;br /&gt;generated from new products developed by the company’s employees from its intellectual property.    The &lt;br /&gt;result will  be dependent on the  environment that unfolds, which in  turn will be influenced by decisions &lt;br /&gt;made by company management, competitors, customers, governments, and  eve n investors. &lt;br /&gt;Assets can be tangible or intangible, and   an asset’s    earning power can produce earnings today and &lt;br /&gt;als o in  the  future in amounts that might be higher or lower than  today.  Together, an  asset’s current &lt;br /&gt;earnings, plus its power to p roduce earnings in t  he   future, constitute its key fundamentals.  Some &lt;br /&gt;investors emphasize paying a reasonable price for today’s earning power, and others are  willi ng to bet on &lt;br /&gt;what    they see as potential growt   h in earning power.  Regardless, I think prudent investing has to be &lt;br /&gt;based on judgments regarding an asset’s present and future earning power.   Once an investor has  &lt;br /&gt;determined an a sset’   s intrinsic value in t  his way, he will have a basis for es tablishing a “right” price &lt;br /&gt;that   will  allow  for good returns in the  future. &lt;br /&gt;Price &lt;br /&gt;While value can se em   theoretical an d ep hemeral, price i   s concrete.   It’s the amount you pay to &lt;br /&gt;obtain something.  Ultimately, a s indicated above, doing a good job of investing comes down to &lt;br /&gt;estimating v alue appropriately and pu rchasing that v   alue at a reasonable price.   &lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above&lt;br /&gt;, t her e are a great   many   t hings that combine  to  make up an as  set ’s fundamentals.  &lt;br /&gt;Ultimately,  the y can be boi&lt;br /&gt;led down to its earni  ng power, and it’s from earnings that   value is derived.

&lt;p&gt;the late 1960s, I was taught at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business that the right &lt;br /&gt;price for an asset is the discounted present value of its future cash flows or earnings.  You might &lt;br /&gt;object: What about all the other things listed above, such as a company’s plant and equipment, intellectual &lt;br /&gt;property, and management, and even its reputation? Don’t they have value?  The value of all of these &lt;br /&gt;things is derived from their ability to contribute to the company’s earning power, and thus it’s captured in &lt;br /&gt;the earnings calculation. &lt;br /&gt;The key part of a security analyst’s job consists of arriving at earnings projections.  Then those &lt;br /&gt;projections have to be converted into a fair price.  At the University of Chicago, the discounting process &lt;br /&gt;was purely mathematical: you divide the earnings for each year in the future by (1+r)&lt;br /&gt;n&lt;br /&gt;, where r is the &lt;br /&gt;appropriate discount rate and n is the number of years out into the future the earnings are, and then you &lt;br /&gt;total up the yearly results.  But in the real world, price is set by a different discounting process, which &lt;br /&gt;consists mostly of people applying their subjective opinions and attitudes about what the asset and &lt;br /&gt;its earning power are worth. &lt;br /&gt;So that’s wha&lt;br /&gt;t an asset’s price is: the consensus view of investors regarding its underlying &lt;br /&gt;fundamental value.  According to Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing and Warren Buffett’s &lt;br /&gt;teacher at Columbia, market prices are set each day by investors who cast their votes by offering to buy or &lt;br /&gt;sell.  Some investors think a company has a solid product line and competent management, and others &lt;br /&gt;consider it stodgy and outmoded.  Some investors find another company sexy and right for the future, and &lt;br /&gt;others think it’s a risky high-flyer.  These attitudes are converted into asset prices.   &lt;br /&gt;This is where&lt;br /&gt; the tug-of-war comes in.  As I see it, every day with regard to every asset, the optimists do &lt;br /&gt;battle with the pessimists.  The market throws out, “GM at $52.”  The optimists think it’s worth $58, so &lt;br /&gt;they’re happy to buy at $52.  Since the pessimists think it’s only worth $46, they’re willing to &lt;br /&gt;accommodate the buyers by selling at $52, and a trade takes place.  But sometimes, one side or the other &lt;br /&gt;predominates.  If the people who think it’s worth $58 outnumber the ones who think it’s worth $46, more &lt;br /&gt;people will want to buy at $52 than want to sell there, so the price will rise to $53, and maybe $54, and so &lt;br /&gt;forth.   &lt;br /&gt;Just as an imba&lt;br /&gt;lance of opinion in one direction or the other can move the price of GM, it can also move a &lt;br /&gt;whole market.  Sometimes the overall mood of investors in a market is positive, meaning they’re &lt;br /&gt;characterized by optimism, credulousness, fear of missing out (“FOMO”), and risk tolerance.  And &lt;br /&gt;sometimes the mood is negative and marked by pessimism, skepticism, fear of loss, and excessive risk &lt;br /&gt;aversion.  Whereas in real life things fluctuate between pretty good and not so hot, in the minds of &lt;br /&gt;investors things can go from flawless to hopeless and back. &lt;br /&gt;When the major&lt;br /&gt;ity of investors are optimistic, they cause price to rise and potentially exceed value.  &lt;br /&gt;And when the pessimists reign, they cause price to decline and potentially fall short of value.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;a preponderance of investor psychology on one side or the other – in lieu of the rationality and objectivity &lt;br /&gt;on which the Efficient Market Hypothesis is predicated – can create the bargains or over-pricings the &lt;br /&gt;hypothesis says can’t exist.  Investors should be on the lookout for them.  &lt;br /&gt;The price of an a&lt;br /&gt;sset means nothing in isolation.  You can’t tell whether a car is good buy at $40,000 &lt;br /&gt;unless you know about the things that determine its market value: its make, model, age, mileage and &lt;br /&gt;condition.  It’s the same in investing; what matters is the relationship between an asset’s price and &lt;br /&gt;its value.  Investors call that relationship the asset’s “valuation.”   &lt;br /&gt;3 All Rights Reserved©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interaction of Price and Value &lt;br /&gt;If an asset&lt;br /&gt; is bought for the right price (or less), its current earnings can give the buyer a good return on &lt;br /&gt;his purchase price while he owns it, and increases in earning power can add to the current return it throws &lt;br /&gt;off and increase its value and thus the price at which it can be sold.  Thus, an investor’s ability to earn &lt;br /&gt;an attractive return on an investment will largely depend on whether he accurately appraised the &lt;br /&gt;investment’s fundamentals and paid an appropriate price for those fundamentals.   &lt;br /&gt;In the long term, the success of an investment will hinge primarily on whether the buyer was right &lt;br /&gt;about the asset’s earning power.  However, an asset’s current earning power and opinions regarding its &lt;br /&gt;future earning power usually don’t change much from month to month or even year to year.  Thus, short-&lt;br /&gt;term investment performance is likely to stem mostly from changes in the price investors are willing &lt;br /&gt;to pay for the asset.  That makes price the dominant consideration for anyone whose principal &lt;br /&gt;concern is the short run.   &lt;br /&gt;Value should b&lt;br /&gt;e thought of as exerting a “magnetic” influence on price.  If price is above value, &lt;br /&gt;future price movements are more likely to be downward than upward.  And if price is below value, future &lt;br /&gt;price movements are more likely to be upward than downward.  However, in the short run, price can &lt;br /&gt;move in just about any direction relative to value.  This is so because an asset’s price at any given &lt;br /&gt;point in time is mostly determined by investor psychology, which can be irrational and unpredictable.  &lt;br /&gt;Thus, while the current relationship of price to underlying value should move in the expected &lt;br /&gt;direction, it can only be counted on to do so in the long run at best.   &lt;br /&gt;“More likel&lt;br /&gt;y to be” is the key phrase in the above paragraph.  An undervalued asset can remain cheap &lt;br /&gt;– or even get cheaper – for a long time, just as an overvalued asset can become more overvalued, and then&lt;br /&gt;extremely overvalued, and then crazily overvalued.  It’s the ability of price to go to crazy extremes that&lt;br /&gt;causes bubbles and crashes.  If price always stopped going up when it began to exceed value, we wouldn’t&lt;br /&gt;have extended bull markets and bubbles (and the ensuing crashes), and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;People who bet hea&lt;br /&gt;vily that price will move in the direction of value – which we call “converging” – can &lt;br /&gt;be carried out if they don’t have sufficient staying power.  That’s why John Maynard Keynes said, “The &lt;br /&gt;market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”  It’s intellectually sound to expect &lt;br /&gt;price to move toward value rather than diverge further from it, and even to bet that it will happen, &lt;br /&gt;but it’s unwise and potentially dangerous to bet heavily that it’ll happen soon.   &lt;br /&gt;As Benjamin G&lt;br /&gt;raham said, in the short run the market functions like a voting machine, reflecting assets’ &lt;br /&gt;popularity.  But in the long run, it’s a weighing machine, assessing assets’ value.  Thus, we can think in &lt;br /&gt;terms of a “calculus of value” that I find entirely logical and almost mathematical . . . except for the &lt;br /&gt;fact that it’s applied by people who aren’t: &lt;br /&gt;•Value is wh&lt;br /&gt;at you get when you make an investment, and price is what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;•A good investment is one in which the price is right for what the value turns out to be.&lt;br /&gt;•Due to the volatile nature of investor psychology, asset prices fluctuate much more than&lt;br /&gt;fundamental value.&lt;br /&gt;•Thus, most price changes reflect changes in investor psychology rather than changes in&lt;br /&gt;fundamental value.&lt;br /&gt;•Because of the key role psychology plays in setting asset prices, in order to have a sense for&lt;br /&gt;where price stands relative to value, investors should try to gauge prevailing psychology, not just&lt;br /&gt;quantitative valuation parameters.&lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved4©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•The relationship of price to value should be expected to strongly influence investment&lt;br /&gt;performance, with high valuations presaging low subsequent returns, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;•But that relationship must not be counted on to have the expected impact in anything but a&lt;br /&gt;long -term sense.&lt;br /&gt;When the price &lt;br /&gt;of an asset is “fair” (however that’s assessed), it’s reasonable for an investor to expect to &lt;br /&gt;earn a return that is likewise fair for the risk borne, relative to the risk-adjusted returns on other assets.  &lt;br /&gt;But so-called “active investors” go to the trouble of studying companies and markets, buying some assets &lt;br /&gt;but not others, and overweighting some and underweighting others – and clients employ active &lt;br /&gt;investment managers and pay them fees – in the hope of earning returns that are more than fair for the risk &lt;br /&gt;borne and thus better than the risk-adjusted returns enjoyed by other investors.  (According to investment &lt;br /&gt;theory, investors can dependably earn a fair or average return by investing passively and thereby avoid &lt;br /&gt;paying active management fees.  But active investors want more.)  What conditions might give rise to &lt;br /&gt;the superior risk-adjusted returns active investors crave? &lt;br /&gt;•The consensus of i&lt;br /&gt;nvestors doesn’t fully comprehend the asset’s current value.&lt;br /&gt;•The market price is too low for the current value of the asset.&lt;br /&gt;•The asset’s value increases more than investors anticipated, usually because of an unforeseen&lt;br /&gt;increase in its earning power.&lt;br /&gt;•The asset becomes more popular with investors, resulting in an increase in its price that is&lt;br /&gt;unrelated to changes in value.&lt;br /&gt;There may be a&lt;br /&gt;dditional possibilities, but I think the above list is pretty exhaustive.  And, of course, &lt;br /&gt;developments in the opposite direction from those described above can result in risk-adjusted returns that &lt;br /&gt;are inferior, including returns that are negative.    &lt;br /&gt;In the absence of&lt;br /&gt; one or more of the conditions listed immediately above, there’s no reason to expect &lt;br /&gt;an investment to provide superior returns.  And even if these things are present, investors shouldn’t &lt;br /&gt;expect to achieve superior results unless they possess the superior insight needed to detect them.  In &lt;br /&gt;a nutshell, it’s helpful to think of returns as stemming from (a) changes in value and (b) changes in &lt;br /&gt;the relationship between price and value, and the people who earn superior returns are the ones &lt;br /&gt;who anticipate those changes better than others.  &lt;br /&gt;How Do Investors&lt;br /&gt; Think About Price and Value? &lt;br /&gt;When you watch fi&lt;br /&gt;nancial TV shows or read about the market in newspapers or investment publications, &lt;br /&gt;most of what you come across relates to price, or to the relationship between price and value.  The &lt;br /&gt;audience doesn’t go there to find out how good the company is or what its earning power will be in 2045.  &lt;br /&gt;They go there to be told whether stock prices will go up or down in the short run (that is, if they know to &lt;br /&gt;ask, whether the short-term return will be more or less than fair for the risk, and superior or inferior to the &lt;br /&gt;risk -adjusted returns on other assets).  And, of course, that’s mostly about price/value.  So where does that &lt;br /&gt;relationship stand today? &lt;br /&gt;Like many thi&lt;br /&gt;ngs that are made up of a large number of ingredients both qualitative and &lt;br /&gt;quantitative, a company’s attributes can’t be summed up through an algorithm or reduced to a &lt;br /&gt;single number.  Evaluating them requires judgment.  And if the value of a company, for example, is &lt;br /&gt;multivariate and confusingly unquantifiable, it obviously can be very hard to assess the fairness of &lt;br /&gt;its price at a point in time. &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved5©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity investors deal with this challenge by looking primarily – often almost exclusively – at a stock’s p/e &lt;br /&gt;ratio, or the ratio of a company’s share price to the amount of earnings attributable to each share of its &lt;br /&gt;common stock.  It’s easy to calculate the p/e ratio for one stock or the average for a stock market or index, &lt;br /&gt;and thus to know how the current p/e ratio compares to p/e ratios on other stocks or at other points in &lt;br /&gt;time.  Deviations from those p/e norms are examined in light of the factors that distinguish the company &lt;br /&gt;from other companies (based on aspects of fundamentals beyond the current earnings) or that distinguish &lt;br /&gt;today from past times, and investors reach conclusions as to whether the asset is overpriced, fairly priced, &lt;br /&gt;or underpriced given those considerations.  Of course, basing an investment decision on a single metric, &lt;br /&gt;such as a stock’s p/e ratio, represents a vast oversimplification of the decision, and thus introduces the &lt;br /&gt;possibility of error. &lt;br /&gt;Getting Up t&lt;br /&gt;o Date &lt;br /&gt;Now we can st&lt;br /&gt;art getting current and concrete.  Where were we when 2025 began? &lt;br /&gt;•The S&amp;P 500 st&lt;br /&gt;ock index is the most watched barometer of the U.S. stock market.  Toward the&lt;br /&gt;end of last year, its forward-looking p/e ratio (the ratio of its price to its estimated earnings over&lt;br /&gt;the coming year) was around 23, significantly above its historical average.&lt;br /&gt;•At the time, J.P. Morgan published a graph showing that if you bought the S&amp;P 500 index at 23&lt;br /&gt;times the coming year’s earnings per share in the period 1987-2014 (the only period for which&lt;br /&gt;there’s data on forward-looking p/e ratios and resulting ten-year returns), your average annual&lt;br /&gt;return over the subsequent ten years was  between plus 2% and minus 2% every time.  To the&lt;br /&gt;extent this p/e ratio history i s relevant, it bodes pretty poorly for the S&amp;P 500.&lt;br /&gt;•I concluded in my January memo that this was troublesome but not threatening, again mostly&lt;br /&gt;because the temporary mania or “irrational exuberance” that I believe accompanies – or gives rise&lt;br /&gt;to –  most bubbles wasn’t present.&lt;br /&gt;That was then&lt;br /&gt;.  What has happened since? &lt;br /&gt;The U.S. stock &lt;br /&gt;markets saw declines of up to 10% in the first quarter of this year, with the tech-heavy &lt;br /&gt;Nasdaq Composite falling the most.  This was primarily the result of unspectacular economic and &lt;br /&gt;corporate performance, moderate but still higher-than  -desired inflation, and possibly worries about &lt;br /&gt;valuation levels and whether the U.S. would retain its position as the world’s investment destination of &lt;br /&gt;choice. &lt;br /&gt;Then, on April&lt;br /&gt; 2, President Trump announced tariffs on imported goods that were much higher and much &lt;br /&gt;more sweeping than had been anticipated.  Investors promptly concluded the tariffs were likely to cause &lt;br /&gt;inflation to accelerate, economic growth to slow, and the U.S. to be viewed less favorably by nations and &lt;br /&gt;investors around the world.  The result was a sharp drop in the S&amp;P 500, taking it to a level 15% lower &lt;br /&gt;than where it was at the end of 2024.  In short, investors determined the fundamental outlook had been &lt;br /&gt;impaired, and they took down stock prices in line with those poorer fundamentals.  Bond investors reacted &lt;br /&gt;as well, demanding a yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note that got as high as 4½%, up from just &lt;br /&gt;over 4% immediately before the tariff announcement.  Higher bond yields mean lower bond prices, and &lt;br /&gt;bond investors made clear that they thought the risks were higher and thus increased risk compensation &lt;br /&gt;was in order.  &lt;br /&gt;But from the&lt;br /&gt; S&amp;P 500’s low point on April 8, it has risen by 29% through yesterday, putting it up by 9% &lt;br /&gt;for the year to date.  Much of this seems to have been a “relief rally,” with trade deal deadlines being &lt;br /&gt;extended and/or tariffs being established below April’s announced levels, and with inflation from tariffs &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved6©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not yet having materialized.  In short, the tariff picture thus far is less bad than was feared at the time of &lt;br /&gt;the original announcements.  It’s also possible that investors are encouraged by expectations of rising &lt;br /&gt;earnings; the tax and spending bill that was passed, with its favorable treatment of corporations; the &lt;br /&gt;pledges to invest in the U.S. that a number of foreign countries have made as part of trade deals; and even &lt;br /&gt;the potential of artificial intelligence to add to companies’ earning power.   &lt;br /&gt;What can we say abou&lt;br /&gt;t the price/value calculus today? &lt;br /&gt;•The S&amp;P 500 was h&lt;br /&gt;ighly valued at the end of 2024 and also just before the tariff announcement.&lt;br /&gt;•The economic possibilities – and likely multi-year earning power for companies – are probably&lt;br /&gt;less positive on balance than they were before the tariff announcement, albeit not as bad as&lt;br /&gt;initially feared.  Rising inflation is still a concern.&lt;br /&gt;•The threat of higher inflation has reduced the likelihood of the early, stimulative interest rate cuts&lt;br /&gt;investors had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;•The trade and tariff agreements the administration sought are being extracted, but the U.S. seems&lt;br /&gt;to be viewed around the world as a less-dependable ally and partner, and some investors may&lt;br /&gt;conclude they should be less heavily weighted toward U.S. assets.  Implementation of this view&lt;br /&gt;could cause net selling and/or reduce the future demand for these assets.&lt;br /&gt;•The U.S. fiscal deficits and national debt show no sign of improvement, and worldwide concern&lt;br /&gt;over them seems to be increasing.&lt;br /&gt;•Nevertheless, with the outlook possibly diminished on balance, U.S. stock prices are up.  While&lt;br /&gt;earnings are expected to rise, stock prices are up more.  Thus, regardless of where it stood as this&lt;br /&gt;year began, the value proposition in U.S. stocks seems to be less appealing today than it was at&lt;br /&gt;year -end – and even then, it wasn’t great.&lt;br /&gt;What are t&lt;br /&gt;he indicators of investor behavior and the resulting price/value relationship? &lt;br /&gt;•The elevated p/e ratio on the S&amp;P 500 is the tentpole of the argument that valuations are&lt;br /&gt;optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;•According to the Financial Times (July 25), “Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are now valued at more than&lt;br /&gt;3.3 times their [companies’] sales, according to Bloomberg, an all-time high.”&lt;br /&gt;•From the same FT &lt;br /&gt;article, “A Barclays ‘equity-euphoria indicator,’ a composite of derivative&lt;br /&gt;flows, volatility and sentiment, has surged to twice its normal level, into territory associated with&lt;br /&gt;asset bubbles.”&lt;br /&gt;•Warren Buffett’s favorite indicator – the ratio of the aggregate market capitalization of U.S.&lt;br /&gt;stocks to U.S. GDP – is also at an all-time high.  It’s especially worth noting that the U.S. market&lt;br /&gt;cap has been restrained by companies’ tendency to wait longer these days before going public and&lt;br /&gt;by the fact that many companies have been taken private in buyouts.  Thus, &lt;br /&gt;this elevated indicator&lt;br /&gt;could be even more troubling than it appears.&lt;br /&gt;•The current relationship between the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and dividend yield&lt;br /&gt;on the S&amp;P 500 shows the latter to be   expensive in historical terms.&lt;br /&gt;•So-c  alled    “meme stocks” – stocks favored by online retail investors, who don’t necessarily think&lt;br /&gt;in terms of the value proposition described above – have attracted heightened attention lately.&lt;br /&gt;Many sport prices that seem low at first glance, but you have to wonder whether their buyers fully&lt;br /&gt;understand the companies’ fundamentals, some of which appear precarious.&lt;br /&gt;•Yield spreads – the amount of incremental yield investors demand if they’re going to give up the&lt;br /&gt;safety of Treasury securities and buy corporate debt for its higher yields – are approaching all-&lt;br /&gt;time lows and are less generous than they were when I wrote the memo&lt;br /&gt; Gimme Credit in March.&lt;br /&gt;This, too, implies an elevated level of risk tolerance on the part of investors, and thus is another&lt;br /&gt;sign    of  a lofty market.&lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved7©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside regarding the valuation of the S&amp;P 500:  A bit over half of its jaw-dropping 58% two-year total &lt;br /&gt;return in 2023-24 was attributable to the spectacular performance of just seven stocks, those of the so-&lt;br /&gt;called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta &lt;br /&gt;Platforms (parent company of Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla.  These are great companies – some are the &lt;br /&gt;best companies ever – and these seven stocks have grown to represent a startling one-third of the total &lt;br /&gt;market value of the 500-stock index.  (Please bear in mind that I don’t claim to be an expert on stocks in &lt;br /&gt;general or tech stocks in particular.) &lt;br /&gt;Because of th&lt;br /&gt;ese companies’ greatness, their stocks are highly valued, and there’s a popular perception &lt;br /&gt;that their elevated valuations are responsible for the S&amp;P 500’s unusually high average p/e ratio.  The fact &lt;br /&gt;is their p/e ratios average out to roughly 33.  This is certainly an above average figure, but I don’t find it &lt;br /&gt;unreasonable when viewed against what I believe to be the companies’ exceptional products, significant &lt;br /&gt;market shares, high incremental profit margins, and strong competitive moats.  (A lot of the Nifty-Fifty &lt;br /&gt;stocks First National City Bank owned when I got there in 1969 were selling at p/e ratios between 60 and &lt;br /&gt;90. Now that’s high!)  Rather, I think it’s the average p/e ratio of 22 on the 493 non-Magnificent&lt;br /&gt;companies in the index – well above the mid-teens average historical p/e for the S&amp;P 500 – that&lt;br /&gt;renders the index’s overall valuation so high and possibly worrisome.&lt;br /&gt;Why are asset prices so strong in the face of what I view as net negative developments?  How can the &lt;br /&gt;S&amp;P 500 have risen 14% in the four-plus months since April 1, the day before the tariffs were announced, &lt;br /&gt;given that most observers believe the tariffs will add to inflation, weigh on economic growth, and reduce &lt;br /&gt;the perception of the U.S. as the premiere investment destination?  Here’s my explanation: &lt;br /&gt;•Investors a&lt;br /&gt;re by nature optimistic.  You must be an optimist to hand over your money to someone&lt;br /&gt;else in the hope of getting more back later.  This is especially true of equity investors, and I think&lt;br /&gt;their optimism dies hard.&lt;br /&gt;•When they’re in an optimistic mood, investors have the ability to interpret ambiguous&lt;br /&gt;developments positively and overlook negatives.&lt;br /&gt;•The last sustained market correction ended in early 2009, meaning it’s been over 16 years since&lt;br /&gt;risk bearing was seriously punished and “buying the dips” wasn’t rewarded.  That means no one&lt;br /&gt;under 35 or so – professional and amateur investors alike – has ever experienced a prolonged bear&lt;br /&gt;market.  Older investors have experienced one or more, but, with the passage of such a long time,&lt;br /&gt;some may have been lulled into a false sense of security.&lt;br /&gt;•Although the U.S. probably continues to offer the best investment fundamentals in the world,&lt;br /&gt;some investors may not appreciate the possibility that it’s a little “less best.”&lt;br /&gt;•Rationalizations often emerge to keep bull markets going.  One these days is “TACO,” which&lt;br /&gt;stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out.”  The suggestion is that his strongest threats – and some&lt;br /&gt;of investors’ worst resulting fears – won’t be realized.&lt;br /&gt;•Given the long skein of good years in the markets, it seems today’s investors are motivated more&lt;br /&gt;by FOMO than by concern about the chance the market is high and likely to produce poor returns&lt;br /&gt;or even losses.&lt;br /&gt;•Finally, of course, the consensus of investors responsible for today’s asset prices probably view&lt;br /&gt;the fundamental outlook as more positive than I do.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the&lt;br /&gt; bottom line of the calculus?  Fundamentals appear to me to be less good overall than &lt;br /&gt;they were seven months ago, but at the same time, asset prices are high relative to earnings, higher &lt;br /&gt;than they were at the end of 2024, and at high valuations relative to history.  Most bull markets are &lt;br /&gt;built through the addition of a “constellation of positives” on top of a well-functioning economy.  Today I &lt;br /&gt;see elements that include the following: &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved8©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•the positive psychology and “wealth effect” resulting from recent gains in markets, high-end real&lt;br /&gt;estate, and crypto,&lt;br /&gt;•the belief that, for most investors, there really is no alternative to the U.S. markets, and&lt;br /&gt;•the excitement surrounding today’s new, new thing: AI.&lt;br /&gt;These are &lt;br /&gt;the kinds of things that have the ability to fire investor imaginations and contribute to bull &lt;br /&gt;markets, and they certainly seem to be doing so now.   &lt;br /&gt;*            *  *&lt;br /&gt;I came across a great  &lt;br /&gt;quote last year from John Stuart Mill    (1859): “He who knows only his own side of &lt;br /&gt;the   case knows little of that.”  In other words, if you’re not conversant with the arguments of those who &lt;br /&gt;oppose your position, you really can’t assess its  validity.  Thus, I can’t responsibly advance my view &lt;br /&gt;without giving the other side of the issue. &lt;br /&gt;In every stron&lt;br /&gt;gly rising market, there has to be a justification for the extended valuations: the “bull &lt;br /&gt;case.”  If it didn’t exist, asset prices couldn’t be where they are.  It’s  usually some variation on “it’s &lt;br /&gt;different this time.”  Here’s how it goes today: &lt;br /&gt;A p/e ratio i&lt;br /&gt;s basically the result of applying a discounted cash flow calculation to a stream of earnings, as &lt;br /&gt;described above.  The main inputs for performing such a calculation and assigning a valuation are &lt;br /&gt;assumptions regarding the earnings’ growth rate , durability, and return on invested capital.  Compared to &lt;br /&gt;the past, today’s S&amp;P 500 is increasingly made up of companies that (a) grow faster, (b) are less cyclical, &lt;br /&gt;(c) require less incremental capital to grow, enabling them to generate more free cash flow, and (d) have&lt;br /&gt;much stronger competitive positions or “moats.”  Thus, they deserve above average p/e ratios.&lt;br /&gt;This explanati&lt;br /&gt;on makes complete sense.  It cites factors that really might be different.  And per Sir John &lt;br /&gt;Templeton, the first person that  I know talked about the trap of “it’s different this time,” 20 percent of the &lt;br /&gt;time things really are; today I’d bet it’s more than 20 percent. &lt;br /&gt;So, on one hand, &lt;br /&gt;“it’s different this time” is a recurring bull   -market cliche that always bears &lt;br /&gt;scrutiny, and on the other hand, failing to   recognize when things actually are different is something &lt;br /&gt;that stands between the average investor and superiority.  I just have no idea which of those two &lt;br /&gt;concerns is more valid today.  But investors should bear three things in mind: &lt;br /&gt;•the enormous likelihood that AI and related developments will change the world,&lt;br /&gt;•the   possibility that it is    “different” for some companies – those that truly embody the factors&lt;br /&gt;listed above and will d  emonstrate the “persistence” I described in On Bubble Watch, but also&lt;br /&gt;•the fact that in most “new, new things,” investors tend to treat far   too many companies &lt;br /&gt;– and&lt;br /&gt;often the wrong ones – as  likely to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;*            *  *&lt;br /&gt;The    existence o&lt;br /&gt;f overvaluation can never be proved, and there’s no reason to think the conditions &lt;br /&gt;discussed above imply there’ll be a correction anytime soon.  But, taken together, they tell me the stock &lt;br /&gt;market has moved from “elevated” to “worrisome.”   &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved9©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you do about it?  I consider tactical actions in terms of the spectrum that runs from &lt;br /&gt;aggressiveness to defensiveness, and when valuations are high, I consider becoming more defensive.  In &lt;br /&gt;the “action shows” my wife, Nancy, and I like to watch, the Pentagon sometimes announces a Defense &lt;br /&gt;Readiness Condition, starting at DEFCON 5 and escalating as the danger grows to DEFCON 1, which &lt;br /&gt;indicates a nuclear attack is underway or imminent.  In a similar vein, I think of progressively applying &lt;br /&gt;the following Investment Readiness Conditions, or INVESTCONs, in the face of above average market &lt;br /&gt;valuations and optimistic investor behavior: &lt;br /&gt;6. Stop buying&lt;br /&gt;5. Reduce&lt;br /&gt; aggressive holdings and increase defensive holdings&lt;br /&gt;4. Sell off the remaining aggressive holdings&lt;br /&gt;3. Trim defensive holdings as well&lt;br /&gt;2. Eliminate all holdings&lt;br /&gt;1. Go short&lt;br /&gt;In my view, it’s essentially impossible to reasonably reach the degree   of certainty needed to  implement &lt;br /&gt;INVESTCON 3, 2, or 1.  Because “overvaluation” is never synonymous with “sure to go down soon,” it’s &lt;br /&gt;rarely wise to go to those extremes.  I know I never   have.  But I have no problem thinking it’s t  im e&lt;br /&gt; f or &lt;br /&gt;INVESTCON 5.  And if you lighten up on things that   appear historically expensive and switc   h into &lt;br /&gt;things that   appear safer, there may be relatively little   to lose from the market continuing to grind higher &lt;br /&gt;for  a while . . . or anyway not enough to lose sleep over. &lt;br /&gt;I ha sten    to&lt;br /&gt; n ote, of course, that c   redit    investments are generally more secure than s   tocks, and thus well &lt;br /&gt;suite   d to serve as defensive holdings in the climate I de&lt;br /&gt;scribe.  The narrow yield   spreads mean today’s &lt;br /&gt;prospective returns on credit aren’t generous relative to those on “risk-free” assets in the   context &lt;br /&gt;of history (see Gimme Credit for the details).  But    the returns are significant in absolute terms, &lt;br /&gt;competitive w&lt;br /&gt;ith t  he historical returns on eq u   ities, and supported by  th e issuers’ contractual &lt;br /&gt;promise to pay interest and r eturn principal, something t hat can’t b  e said for  st ocks. &lt;br /&gt;August 13, 2025 &lt;br /&gt; All Rights Reserved10©   2025  Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.&lt;/p&gt;

Will）氏は、5月28日&lt;br /&gt;付けのThe Washington Postの記事の中で、進歩主義の9つの基本原則を提示しているが、&lt;br /&gt;そのうちの1つが「現代の米国人による政府のモノとサービスの消費を賄うための、未来の&lt;br /&gt;米国人からの無制限の借り入れ」である。これこそが、すべての政治家（ごく少数  の真の  財&lt;br /&gt;政保守派を除く）の考え方を的確  に言い  表しているのだろう。&lt;/p&gt;
